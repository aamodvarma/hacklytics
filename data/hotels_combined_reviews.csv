Worst breakfast I have ever had in a Hilton brand hotel)  Anyway I did my checkout thru mobile app and dropped the keys and left. Afterwards when I checked my receipt I saw that I only got 35 dollars for credit instead of 71$ which dissapointed me and I got in touch with an agent thru app to create a case.

Citadines Tour Eiffel Paris,,No pride of ownership ,"If you’ve ever stayed at a hotel which owners showed no pride of ownership, this is it. The carpet and hallways are worn and dated. Simple things that do not cost much to repair are neglected such as unpatched holes in the walls, half painted baseboards, chipped paint, broken things left and right, etc… There was not a single picture or painting in our room. Because it is right next to the subway, the location is convenient. However, every time the subway passes, the room rumbles and I wouldn’t advise it if you’re a light sleeper.

We were a group of three travelers. The private dual-bunk bedroom was way too cramped for three people, and what more for four persons? It was a mistake to trust other online reviews.   Upon arrival, we were greeted with rudeness (this was after a whole day of train travel), the unpleasantness was already a red-flag by then. There was a female reception that was the exception for she was cordial and warm.   The linens were thin and ratty, we couldn’t sleep as doors were banging loudly each time another guest(s) exit their room.  Imagine this going all-night long.

In short, our stay was disappointing.   The good: the hostel is in a decent location. You can walk to Montmartre and Gare du Nord is practically on the doorstep. The food in Belushis is also quite good.  I can't really get past how unclean the hostel is. It is absolutely filthy. The common area does not get cleaned often, and as a result there are rodents living there. I don't mind animals, and this mouse seemed a charming fellow, but mice simply do not gather in clean places. This suggests that the hostel has a long term cleanliness problem.
