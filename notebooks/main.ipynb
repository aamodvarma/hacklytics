And thank you so much Faruk. Our stay in Romance was awesome super clean hotel , good breakfast with healthy choices too comfortable beds but most of all the staff each and everyone were helpful pleasant particularly Shirin at the front desk and Haka at the reception ,he made our stay very comfortable with knowledge suggestions and arranging our tours . I had a lot of hesitations as I was on crutches unfortunately on the trip but they let me use their wheel chair and tram station was right across with one stop or even walkable to all major attractions. Seema  My second stay at this hotel. Everything was perfect both times: the comfortable room with a touch of history, the location near historic sights, shops, restaurants and ATM, the service and friendly and helpful staff, and the Turkish spa treatments to unwind after a day of walking. Location is very good near historical places and Hagia Sophia and best place Topkapi. Breakfast is good and service is very nice. Room was big and clean. Decoration is cute. Hamam is nice we was relaxed. Staff is very kind and helpful Great location, friendly staff, clean rooms. Staff everywhere — at front desk, in restaurant, room service, etc. — is super accessible and helps you with anything you want. We stayed here for 8 nights as a family of 6 in 2 rooms. Would stay here again. Great location very close to hagia sophia and toptaki palace, very helpful staff. Helped us with curating our stay, booking cruise . Breakfast was nice.

I really enjoyed their performance during my trip. We had a great time visiting Istanbul and staying at the Conrad. One of the main reasons we booked is Hiltons ability to book connecting rooms. We booked a suite connecting to another bedroom as we are a family and like to be close to one another.  Service was very good, special should out goes to Night Manager Aziz Atsan who helped us with some last minute things.  The room was amazing, beautifully decorated and amazing views over the Bosphorus and all of Istanbul.  Would easily and gladly recommend to friends and family coming to town.  It was a very pleasent experience as always. Very fasinating view. I try to chosee Conrad as possible for my confort and safety. The location of the hotel is also very good. The rooom is perfectly clean and tidy. A special thanks to Ms. Gönü for her kind support. It was first experience we stayed in conrad with my family, lovely staff and well located in istanbul.. service was perfect and will stay for sure again on spring and summer holiday Thanks to all staff in conrad , special thanks to Tuğçe and Tahsin I was assisted by Tugce and Tahsin in the restaurant. They are very polite and I had no issues understanding their speech, their english was good. The buffet has a variety of menus, which is great for international visitors. The view is great. Amazing!!!!! Good view and good stay! Very Good location!! Good food, excellent BED!!  In the room have a lot of space and it is very nice. I really love to come back and recommend to my friends and followers of course. Thank you for the hospitality Selim :) We had always wanted to plan a visit to Istanbul. However, an unplanned change in flight itineraries made us accidental tourists of Istanbul and guests for 3 nights at Conrad Istanbul Bosphorus. Everything about Conrad was above expectations: the overall atmosphere, customer service, room comfort, location, and restaurant. The breakfast buffet at Manzara restaurant was exceptional, made more memorable by the friendly smiles and service of our hostesses Busra and Melek. We look forward to planning our longer stay and tour of Istanbul soon. It's a wonderful city to explore. I would like to spiecal thanks for Busra to great service and well attitude with us in the breakfast morning and for all who is working here .. as they surprise us for our boy birthday which that make him very happy .. as i want yo mention the room service and cleaning staff .. really appreciate 👌🏻 It was one of my big chances to choose this hotel in istanbul. Every thing was great, staff were so professional and the room service and breakfast were perfect. I want to thank ms melek and mr abo . It was a pleasure knowing you. Gülbahar, furkan, melek, büşra ( the receptionist ) all made my trip so delightful. They were so warm and welcoming every time we came in. The service was exceptional. The breakfast and food in the executive lounge was fresh and delicious. I look forward to coming back. Everything was great in this hotel. Amazing staff member. Stunning rich Breakfast at Manzara restaurant and ex lounge.  The rooms with so comfy bed and the Bosphorus views was fantastic!  Cleanliness was excellent !  Front door (security guy) were also so friendly. Taxi services was so fast. Easy and safe ! Also the Spa team. All great ! Special thanks to Mr Serkan front desk who made our check in so easy. Profesional staff member !  Thanks Conrad and all the team..for your great hospitality ! We will come back soon ! We were very pleased with the experience and stay at the Conrad Instanbul.   Everyone was very helpful and professional at any level position held here at the Conrad.   I would like to thank our housekeeper, Sevil.  Sevil, was very attentive to detail and allowed us to come back to a clean and presentable room every night - stress free!    We look forward to sharing our experiences with our family and friends and we look forward to returning again this year! Welcoming style of the staff is excellent. Food quality at the breakfast  is perfect. Especially Büşra and Melek took care of us and our child with a seamless manner. The position of the room and the bed in the room and the pillow is really Fine. Beautiful hotel, when you arrive you really get the wow factor as is to be expected for a Conrad.   Stayed in a King Executive Room and was greeted by chocolates and fruit juice in the room which was a nice touch. Staff are really friendly and can’t do enough to help you, especially Gűlbahar, Furkan and Eren in the Executive Lounge. There’s a happy hour between 5pm and 7pm where there’s dinner served, as well as free alcoholic drinks. The G&Ts with grapefruit are beautiful 👏🏼  The hotel is in a great location with easy access to the waterfront, bus stop is outside to get into Grand Bazaar and the Metro is a 10 minute walk away.   Would recommend a visit to Karaköy which is maybe a 20-25 minute walk, lots of nice bars and restaurants, lovely area. Everything was great, accommodation, breakfast, location, and nice staff The breakfast was wonderful, varied, and had a beautiful view I would like to thank Melek Hamdi  for service and help   ———————————- Thank you Conrad Istanbul Bosphorus Incredible customer service by all staff. This is world class service by a seriously hard working customer focused staff. Also just genuinely friendly people representing the best of their great country.  My review: In my opinion Istanbul is the best city in the world and the most beautiful and the best hotel in the world is Conrad. Gülbahar furkan is the most helpful and the kindest lady in the executive lounge of Conrad.  We booked a couple of nights in Conrad. We were returning here after over a year and we were extremely satisfied with the Service. The hotel experience was already comfortable in the past but we were pleasantly surprised that they had up their game even further. The Executive Lounge access was cherry on the top. The staff was very courteous. In particular, Ms. Gulbahar working in the Executive Lounge took special care of us and gifted a stuff toy to our son - which he loved.  Although none of my request has been granted, it is an excellent hotel where all the staff are so helpful and you dont feel that you are away from home.  The hotel is very clean and safe. All the staff are well trained and mannered.   I highly recommend it The hotel situated in a good area with a nice view. However the struggle of English language by some of the staff wasn't great.  I can't exit the screen as I have to write at least 200 characters! Sorry can't do it anymore this is just to add up to 200                     The service was impeccable and amazing and I want to say a special thanks to buşra and melek and tikdağ they made the stay more enjoyable and memorable they really ensured my satisfaction to the maximum  Nurdgoan was very kind and professional when he entered our room to clean our bathroom. Extremely meticulous with his work and it really shows. Very friendly and one of the best hotel staff members I have had in recent years.  special thanx for  Busra  melek Tikodah for there great hospitality and very professional  always smile to the customers and helping them hotel is very clean and tidy  receptionist Yasmen was very kind  to us and give us great promotion to upgrade our room   It's one of the best stay.  Rooms were perfect.  The housekeeping was always doing their job perfectly.  Busra & Melek was taking care during breakfast. They are so nice and professional.  The executive lounge was very nice.  All staffs are kind helpful and professional.   It was an amazing stay with fantastic view of Bosphorus secondly Conrad made our day with such a unique way for our anniversary and secondly for our Hospitality in breakfast special care taken by Busra and Melek they were the best and both have given their best to make us happy. And yes guys please try their turkish breakfast ask Busra she will assist you for that.  Thank you Conrad once again for the best stay we will come back soon.  I stayed in Conrad Bosporus and being a gold member, we were upgraded to a room with a magnificent view of the Bosporus Straits. Overall service and hotel cleanliness was top notch. Service staff Busra and Ibrahim ensured my experience in this hotel was a wonderful experience. We are having a fantastic time here in Istanbul. I have been to my fair share of executive lounges around the world. Conrad Istanbul executive lounge feels very special. Their personal touch and willingness to help and make your day special is something that makes this place standout. Gulbahar and her colleagues have been very helpful and friendly during our stay. They are willing to go above and beyond. I have been here several times over the years and I’ll definitely come back. Many thanks. The lounge and patio service for breakfast and happy hour were  fantastic.  Drinks and find were really good with plenty of options. And the deserts were very tasty.  Gamze bekdas/ceren and Gulbahar and all the staff were attentive and pleasant. Thank you. Great breakfast service Gomze Bekdas and Ceren.  Good food too!  Great hotel would stay here again. Wonderful service and food quality.  Convenient location to Bestikas neighborhood.  Easy access to ferrry and central Istanbul. Clean comfortable rooms. Amazing Christmas brunch at Conrad Hilton Manzara Restaurant. Perfect service from İbrahim, hats off to an exceptional chef. The meal was beyond delicious, so wonderful with panoramic view. Highly recommended.\"},\n",

Mike  During my stay my colleague had her birthday  We thought to have a birthday cake made for her  At Guest relations Angelen and Ece were amazing the organizers the cake immediately and were so helpful and caring  Thank you ladies Excellent experience. I was in Instanbul for quite a stressfull business trip and the Hilton was an island of peace and care. Special praise to Lidya-omer (huge apologies if I butchered your name), who took some xtra mile in making the stay much more comfortable than expected. A very luxory hotel in Istanbul. The facilities, the staff, the food everything is 10.0 rate. Sergen at the front desk was very nice and polite. Also ask for Agcelen from Guest Relations if you need anything, she is very nice and helpful. I recommend this hotel for pleasure as well. Enjoy! This is my second visit to this superb hotel. From the very welcoming check-in the superb executive floor room. So beautifully furnished. The new Executive Lounge is well worth a visit. I will look forward to returning later this year. Hopefully with more time to explore this very special City. It was a nice stay but the service could have been better. I think an important detail is an earwax or shoe shine in the rooms.  In short, in my opinion, it has more shortcomings than most hotels I have stayed in. Excellent hotel with huge breakfast buffet and luxury facilities. Service was excellent. As a diamond member, I was able to get late checkout and additional extended hours to the executive lounge and facilities on day of checkout. Mr Mert Serdar excelled in ensuring I get those benefits. A very warm and welcome reception given by Aygeler Alper. Her wonderful smile and greeting at the reception cheered us up despite being at a busy period. Despite having had a busy day and a long day at work, it was encouraging to see her enthusiasm in keeping us at ease. Very nice welcoming gast check in free drink and up grade what more donu need thanks alot for mrs aycelen  and mr. Serger   Looking forward to come back again and happy anniversary and more and more to come.                      Always my choice of accommodation every time I visit Istanbul. The neatness us topnotch, very relaxing ambience and the feel of neatness is always present as you walk through the corridors to your room.  Best stay, as always! We stay with Hilton bomonti every time we are in Istanbul. We Stayed here as a couple, as a group of friends, and Now as family with two kids. The staff is great, the rooms ar great. Also, best breakfast. Special Thanks to Ele.  Excellent service from Yasar at Globe Restaurant! He was very friendly, helpful and hospitable, despite how busy it was, and we enjoyed our meals there very much! Had a lovely stay here overall, including great facilities. Ceren , Huri, Emrah and Sinan in Exec lounge are just fantastic…nothing was too much for them.  Went out of their way to put a smile on  every guests face.  The food offering is fantastic, one of the best I’ve seen.  It is a great experience.  The views are also pretty fantastic. this is my second time in this month to be in this hotel, and as always i’m having a great time with the excellent service and staff. Thank you all for it, and this time specially i would like to Afife Gulce Cakiroglu for her kindness and her assistance with me and my family. I’ve stayed in this hotel several times and they never disappointed me. Excellent service, excellent operations management. Special thanks to the Executive Lounge team (Emrullah, Huri hanim, Hüseyin, Arif, Keziban, Özkan, Sinan, İzzet, Emrah). Me and my mom cannot consume chillies and the Executive lounge team took care of our dietary request every night. Cannot tell how it feels when the entire Executive lounge staff remember your name any time they serve you. It's location and overall comfort met my expectations. Staff was helpful.  Special thanks to Sinan Ozturk. The amenities were satisfactory, adding value to my stay. Overall, a good experience, and I'd consider it again for future visits to Istanbul. The staff is very welcoming, great location, and feeling very comfortable  Every body is making sure that you are feeling comfortable. This hotel will be my first choice in Istanbul for sure.  Special thanks for MR. Sergen for being very kind 👍 Amazing hotel one of the best hotels in Istanbul, we usually visit Istanbul 3 times per year this hotel considered like second home.

Radisson Blu Ottomare is best hotel at the world! I\\'ve stayed in this hotel during 12-13.09.2023. 1. Although the room booked by agent was at 120 euro+VAT rate, at reception I was given a \"premium room\" at 200 euro+VAT. Eventually, following the exchange with the agent, the room price suddenly dropped. 2. The \"premium room\" was found outdated, bathroom door once closed could not be open and room entrance door was recently with visible repairs. 3. The bathroom was not clean and with evident smell of mold. 4. At my request, due to business to another location, I had to check-out on 13.09.2023 PM, and not 14.09.2023 AM. I was not fully charged full fare, but also charged for my wife and parking. I am sorry but is not business orientated behavior.  Upon arrival we had 3 suitcases, 2 rucksacks and a baby in a pushchair. Did the staff offer to help us with our bags or did they stand there and chat? The answer is the latter so that was problem number 1.  When we checked in, the receptionist was surly and had a miserable face on her. When we complained that no-one had offered to help us with the bags she upgraded us to a junior suite but we could not check in until 3pm. We sat and waited in the lobby and noticed there was some complimentary water and cookies available. The water cooler was blocked so you could not actually use it and the cookies were not covered and so had flies all over them.  The pool area is lovely but my God the list of rules is a joke. Wear a swim cap (no-one did), no children under 5 allowed in the main This hotel is overall good, but there are flaws that many people dont mention in their rewiews. Now we just got home from 9 nights at the Ottomare.  First, Radisson Blu Ottomare has a nice location outside the busy city centre with wiew to the Marmara sea. 800 meters walk to Zeitinburnu train station and from there only three stops to Sirkeci. Recommend this before taxi.   The hotel is beautiful and our room at the 4th floor was lovely (dont be fooled by the pics, hotel top floor is 4th. The rest are apartments). We got an upgrade to a larger room with balcony, but it is narrow and just for smoking with an ash tray. Not chairs to sit and enjoy the wiew. The gym is superb and very well eqipped, and the outside area with the pool is really nice. The restaurant inside is nice and Thanks Bro ( Guest Relations Manager Levent ) he is my man , he is super . Thanks whole team also . They are super. Pool is super, suit is super, breakfast is super.

       "  'concatenated_reviews': '                    It was a place where I went on holiday with my friends. The employees were really very humble. The location and comfort of the hotel were great. The unique view on the top floor of the hotel was wonderful. We will come again. I would like to thank the front office team for the service they provided us from the first day to the last day (: You did your best to make us comfortable. I hope to see you again :) thanks thanks :) Love this hotel! Booked it with my husband for my 50th birthday. Everything about it was very good. Staff - extremely polite, nice , they ll do everything to make your stay special. Really outstanding service. Spa facilities were great - pool, sauna, hammam , gym. We booked airport transfer with hotel and it costed EUR 50.00 each way which is very reasonable price. Hotel is new and very modern. Bathroom is top class. Restaurant is on the 5th floor and has stunning view of Istanbul! Breakfast - lots of tasty food, but there is only one thing I would suggest here is to add more choice for  vegan people such as hummus and soya (almond or oat) milk. Hotel location is great and within walking distance from main attractions and tram stations. Hiagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Basilica first of all do not believe the good reviews. just do the math a bit an see that almost 99% of the reviewers have  this review as FIRST CONTRIBUTION.  we r asked to write them when we order food to restaurant. and they literary read what you write so yep... you do. the math. When I went to the restaurant of this hotel Efe, Firat and Umit put in front of me a paper with their names and asked me to write good things about this hotel. Because I was in a foreign country I was afraid to contradict them but I felt very bad about this practice.moreover, one of these 3 fellows was over my phone reading what I was writing! I felt very insecured in this place...there one single and only thing positive about this hotel:  The view of the town is amazing from the panoramic restaurant on the fifth floor. But this is the building not the staff there. after this experience turkey and Istanbul will be a big no no for me because I really felt abused and threatened there. We spent 5 days in Istanbul for an event that Wife attended. Emailed Ibrahim (Manager) just to provide a quite nice room.  He not only courteously emailed back but also responded in kindness with a good room. Bathrooms are tight/small but room functional & clean & bed large enough for peaceful sleep  On arriving we were met with friendly staff Emre, Selim & Mert who continued to support us on our stay. They are standout people who want to inform & assist guests to maximise their stay, highly knowledgeable.  The Hotel itself has brilliant service but varied breakfast to choose from a Roof top restaurant with almost 360 degree view of Istanbul that is quite breath taking. You feel close proximity to it all with ships sailing on the Bosphorus to historic Mosques & views of the Generally speaking, I have found that hotel restaurants are uninspiring.  However, Eva Bosphorus Restaurant in the beautiful Demiray Hotel is an exception to the rule.      The view is the best I have found in the city.     The food is fresh and is good as we have had here (and İstanbul is a foodie city).  Our waiter, Serdar, was very friendly, efficient, and made a great Turkish wine recommendation.   Additionally, his knowledge of other areas of Turkey was quite helpful.  We look forward to our return and will be putting both Eva Bosphorus Restaurant and Demiray Hotel at the top of our list. Great hotel with fanatic views and a team that couldn\\'t do enough! Would def come back.  Great views of Istanbul. Could do more for vegans. But overtake service grear. Efe and Firat gave excellent service. Serdar was a great host, give him a pay rise! Lovely rooftop views, excellent beer and food. Would recommend staying here if you visit Istanbul, close to lots of transport links and some of the major tourist attractions. Very helpful on reception. very kind people, very good vibe. The best view on the roof of the restaurant. Serdar the waiter is very kind and will help you with everything.  The room is beautiful, clean everyday.  Location of hotel is very good. You can go by foot almost everywhere. Loved my stay here! Super clean and tiny rooms, room service is amazing, breakfast was great, and the staff were absolutely lovely - constantly smiling and making sure we are okay. Felt like home. Very good location and walking distance to most popular locations. Wanted to especially mention Serdar who was extremely kind, attentive and even gave us a long list of recommendations in Istanbul! A beautiful stay would definitely stay here again. Thank you Emrah for your lovely service and the tea! Thank you Demiray :)  An excellent hotel with everything.The location is great, you can easily reach everywhere.I want to thank all the employees. They took good care of us during our stay ..  :) :) Endless thanks to all Demiray family It is a hotel with a magnificent restaurant with a terrace area. The restaurant staff are very attentive and friendly, they are very professional in what they do, especially Emrah Ümit and Efe, who made our night beautiful. I would definitely recommend this place.🍔🍕🥗🥂🍾 When I saw the pictures from this beautiful hotel for the first time, I immediately fell in love :-)  The view, the nice and kind people who are working here and the luxury style rooms. We are here since 2-3 hours and we are totally mesmerized, specially from the dinner. At the 5th floor we could have a breath-taking view to the whole city while we were eating our super delicious food served by the nicest and friendliest waiters: Emrah and Ismail. I never really like to go back to a hotel when i was there earlier, but I swear I am gonna come back to this hotel!:-) Good hotel not far from Serkeci tram and metro. The breakfast is good and fresh. The staff is helpful. The room is average but confortable.I order a food using room service about 1AM. The service is fast and the food is delicious. I recommande it This hotel is impeccably clean and modern. The staff, lead by manager Ugur, was very friendly and helpful. We felt very welcome here. The top floor restaurant has an incredible breakfast buffet, and the dinner menu was very nice too. Great views are a bonus.  Although the neighborhood is off the main thoroughfare, it is a short walk to everything. Our Deluxe Double room had a king size bed. The bathroom was small, but complete. Very satisfied with the hotel. Best of the best rooftop restaurants, with a stunning view, excellent food, high quality service, and a genuine \"nothing is too much trouble\" attitude among the staff. Also a good sized swimming pool and gym, unlike some hotels where the facilities are tiny; a great location walking distance from the Grand Bazaar, Blue Mosque, Eminonu ferries, etc.   The hotel staff are very friendly and speak many languages, English and Italian for example.  Elif guest relations is very professional, polite and friendly.  The views from the rooftop restaurant of Istanbul are fantastic!!!!  Wonderful hotel! Big comfortable bed! Incredibly responsive staff for everything even if you ask them about the things outside the hotel! Incredibly rich breakfast , there have everything you can ask! Top view of the entire Bosphorus! I recommend Clean and modern hotel in a central location. Walking distance to Hagia Sophia, blue mosque and cistern. The breakfast is an absolutely delicious spread. There is something for everyone. All with a magnificent view of the sea. The rooms are modern with comfortable beds. The location is quiet. The hotel staff are friendly, attentive and cannot do enough for you.    Very reasonable priced. Spa and staff were amazing. Highly recommend! Elif and anil were awesome! The fresh orange juice was a nice touch at breakfast and the selection was absolutely incredible. The view from the rooftop was great as well! Amazing staff special thanks to Emre, Anil & Elif. They were very attentive and helpful. Enjoyed our stay here :) totally satisfied with our choice. Will recommend everyone to come here as it’s walking distance to Sultanahmet and all the tourist attractions Our overall experience was excellent at this hotel, hotel is very clean and very near to all major locations, amazing breakfast with and an amzaing view of bosphorus, you can walk to all major attractions and in the last I would like to thanks Ms Elif, special thanks to her for being so Kind and humble all the time, very kind with kids A big thumbs UP to Elif who should stand at the reception because her English and her sympathy are very good 👍 Also thank you to Ismaeel for his friendly smile and service.  Other good points were:  - The amazing Rooftop with view  - The service at Eva Bosphorus Restaurant  - The cleanliness of the rooms - The location of the hotel - The Spa was very relaxing  Negative points were:  - The hotel is situated in heights and most of the taxis are not allowed to drive till there so they will probably drop you at Cirkeci which is about 200m from the hotel and then you\\'ll have the climb up the long stairs to get finally there (definitely not easy with the heavy luggage!). But get used to it coz you\\'ll probably do it more then once..  - We expected a room with two single beds but they Hotel staff service was very good. Elif at the reception / concierge desk as well as the rest of the staff are always very nice and very helpful in assisting with whatever I may need. They were able to quickly obtain a taxi for me to leave the hotel after visiting Topkapi palace. Absolutely amazing hotel, best staff ever! Especially Salim, Emrah, Emre, Mert, Mustafa and Hazar on reception and in the restaurant shout out to Emrah, Ismail, Umit, all of you made our holiday so special, best staff we have ever met! Amazing service    Really nice food 👌🏼 Fantastic location, rooftop view is beautiful and such a nice atmosphere would highly recommend to stay here when you go to Istanbul!  Fantastic hotel. We had 2 rooms and stayed 9 nights. The location is in an excellent location for all local attractions. The staff are brilliant and only too willing to help. Elif was great on our first day and explained where we could change money and how to get to local attractions. Selim on the front desk is an absolute gentleman. We had an issue with a taxi driver one of the days and he came out and sorted it out. Highly recommended and I will definitely stay again at the Demiray Hotel when I return to Istanbul.  I had an amazing stay at the Demiray Hotel in Istanbul! The rooms were impeccably clean and comfortable, making for a very pleasant experience. The staff, particularly Selim, Belal, and Elif, went above and beyond to provide excellent hospitality. Elif was especially great with my daughter, making her feel right at home.  One of the highlights of the hotel was the spectacular rooftop restaurant, offering breathtaking views of the city. It was truly a delightful experience enjoying fantastic food while taking in the mesmerizing sights.  The location of the hotel was unbeatable, within walking distance of iconic attractions like Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, Suleymaniye Mosque, and the Grand Bazaar. However, it\\'s worth noting that the area is quite hilly, which might pose a The place is beautiful and the rooms are comfortable. The food is delicious and I loved breakfast😍.   The hotel has a very relaxing Spa, every day I go  On my next visit to Istanbul, I will definitely come back. I would recommend this hotel to all my friends and family Beautiful view from rooftop/terrace, great pool/spa, close proximity to all major attractions, clean rooms, friendly staff.  You can walk to all major places. Food is fabulous. Would highly recommend it.'},\n",

Upon check-in, the staff was beyond friendly, and was eager to please, throughout the entire stay, everyone was very friendly, and never made us feel that we were inconveniencing them by asking questions.  During check-in, they offered refreshments and made the check-in process easy. They also gave us local good luck charms that was quite sweet. They also decorated our room for our first visit as a couple.   The room was not necessarily large, but was decent size and great value for the money. The shower was amazing, that water pressure is no joke! They have a rooftop terrace that is open 24/7 with a coffee machine that can make anything from espresso to a cappuccino. They also offer a breakfast buffet that, typically in hotels are Staying at the White House Hotel exceeded our highest expectations while visiting Istanbul for a week. All of the employees at this establishment are extremely professional and went out of their way to give us the BEST treatment from arriving at the front steps to anything we needed. The complimentary Turkish breakfast was a great  addition and was delicious. I have never been treated so kindly and warmly at any other 5 star hotel like this one. Highly recommend and will be staying here again when in Istanbul again. The hotel is a lovely boutique experience. From the start , we were impressed with the friendly staff , Nothing was too much trouble and they always went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed . They also upgraded one of our rooms so our daughters could stay on the same level and close to our room which we were very grateful for. They were always very gracious, helpful and obliging. The hotel is very comfortable , warm and inviting including a pleasant aroma which was always very nice to return to each day after exploring the city. :) it is decorated in a lovely traditional style and has many personal touches including welcome and farewell gifts, (evil eye trinket, refreshments, Turkish delight and tea) personal handwritten welcoming letter, beautifully The service here was amazing! Everyone was super kind and helpful. My husband and I enjoyed the breakfast each morning on the rooftop terrace. We were able to walk to everything. The room was clean and spacious. I would stay here again if I came back to Istanbul. We loved how close it is to the grand bazaar and the main mosques. Rooms we very clean and beautifully decorated, breakfast was included and was fantastic. Breakfast located on rooftop with a view, and includes impressive spread of quality foods. Would recommend! A sensational experience, this has been my 14 visit to White House, every thing in this hotel has gone for the better over the years, friendly staff, an excellent variety of food at breakfast (included), free coffee machine 24 hrs, tourism advice, not to mention vicinity to major historical sites. The World\\'s Best Boutique Hotel. Always majestic and Excellent experience!!! We stayed in the White House Hotel for 6 nights for our small family reunion in Istanbul (occupied 3 rooms) and thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel management and staff do everything to make you feel welcome and accommodate your wishes. The rooms are are clean and spacious, bathrooms are modern and well maintained. The beds are very comfortable, we slept so well we could have missed all the sightseeing :-).  The hotel is located in the heart of the old town in 5-10 minutes walking distance from the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, the Grand Bazaar and a myriad of restaurants with delicious food. Hotel has a roof-top terrace where they serve breakfast and where you can use a coffee machine 24x7 which is very nice.  This hotel is a GEM! Perfectly located, warm, friendly and knowledgeable staff. Super comfortable room beds. All hotel team and Housekeeping staff was incredible. Every morning the breakfast was exceptional. Fresh hot foods, eggs, meat selections etc. It\\'s great to start our day with the perfect view from the rooftop. So glad we stayed at the White House Hotel Istanbul. Hands down an excellent choice. A great boutique hotel to experience the most of Istanbul. Staff was great, and they really deserve a lot of credit, as they really have the spirit to receive well and do their best for all their guests. The presence and attention of Mr. Harun serves as an example of how to run a business. Service was perfect. The room was nice, cozy, clean and the breakfast at the rooftop is a nice touch to start the day. Location is perfect, near major attractions and amazing restaurants. The reviews were excellent which attracted my attention. As others noted the location is great - a short walking distance to all of the major attractions. The superior room was very nice. The owner Harun however was extraordinary. He upgraded our room before we arrived, he had a welcome letter, candles and rose petals and a balloon to welcome us. And he also had a sixth sense about not only our needs but everyone else as well. For example, he intervened when he saw a couple about to take a taxi that would have surely overcharged them. The breakfast buffet was exceptional and the indoor/outdoor roof terrace made the breakfast even more special. We could see the water, Hagia Sophia and many other sites from the rooftop. His staff was also very kind and helpful as well. It is a White House Hotel Istanbul is a beautiful place to stay Management/stuff  is very helpful And the breakfast area on the roof top give the beautiful view  restaurants and grand bazar is on walking distance too Harun helped me with the train pass also he is very very friendly and trustworthy Over all I loved it!! I really highly recommend to stay this hotel! We stay at white house hotel in turkey its a very nice hotel very clean and staff are very help breakfast buffet is really good i recommend if someone come to turkey stay with them .when you need help to go outside to explore the city staff and manager are really helpful to guide you . Good service good place to stay. Very affordable and nice hotel. Very good people, nice friendly and very polite. 24 hours service. On one call the come and fix if there is anything wrong or you need anything from them. We visit this place. Safe place to live and  never ever anything misplaced from room. This hotel is very centrally located in Old Istanbul and walking distance to touristy places. I had less than 24 hrs stay in Istanbul and chose this one based on travel blogs and proximity to city center. Harun at the front desk was very warm and welcoming and took time to  go over what I could do during my short stay.  My room was bright and cozy and comfortable. Do not miss the breakfast at the roof terrace. Sky Views in early morning are spectacular from the terrace. From Day 1 we were treated with warm great service. Harun, the owner of the White House hotel was wonderful in taking care of all our needs. The amount of personal attention given to each guest is incredible. The room was clean and is kept smoke-free. The bathroom is functional and has great shower. The grand traditional Turkish decor all over the place is a nice change and allows for a fully indulgent Turkish experience.   Overall a great place to spend your Istanbul vacation. Great location with all the major old City attractions within walkable distance and also surrounded by great highly-rated restaurants.    Excellent location in Sultanahmet close to Hagia Sophia, Basilca Cistern and Grand Bazaar etc. Wonderful customer service by Harun and team. Good amenities and breakfast Recommend going with the hotel suggested yellow taxi pickup and dropoff.  Two thumbs up 👍👍Booked it because of recommendations here and it delivered! Came in an early morning flight and was treated to free breakfast and early room check-in. We travelled with 2 kids (11 and 9 yo), each had her own bed in the triple room. Bathrooms super clean, abundant bottles of toiletries. Rooftop dining area overlooks Hagya Sofia and was a great place to view fireworks on New Year’s eve. Can’t beat the location, walking distance to everything we you can visit the attractions multiple times. Staff even walked us to tram station to teach us how to use the ticket machine! Never had to lift a finger with luggage and airport transfer. Caring and respectful team. Came back to the same hotel after side trip to Cappadocia.. will return! We had 2 rooms, next to each other.  The hospitality was incredible.  We arrived at 2am and the wonderful reception desk received us with welcome drinks and Turkish delights.  Breakfast was amazing - you can order all sorts of Turkish eggs!  The rooms are small and that was the only \"surprise.\"   Excellent hotel that is based in a really central location near both the bazaar and also the tram which can take you to the other side of Istanbul. The staff have been very friendly and courteous during the entire stay with nothing being too much of an issue                       One of the best\\xa0experiences\\xa0I’ve had at a hotel before. The hotel is amazing, highly beautiful and\\xa0unique.\\xa0I picked this hotel as boutique choice and it did not disappoint. Price was just slightly higher than other hotels but it’s very very nice and feels luxurious. It’s also has a great location, walking distance to the main attractions as well as plenty restaurants in the neighbour. Once you walk into this hotel you feel the warmth immediately, they also have a helpful concierge that made some dinner reservations for us! The staff are always welcoming, kind and always available. The rooms are nice,decent sized and you get a mini bar stocked daily. the breakfast is AMAZING, it was so good we just kept going back every single morning. I think the breakfast buffet is great for The hotel is clean and maintained well. Excellent service is given by the staff from start to finish. The staff try at all times to keep the customer satisfied and go out of their way to assist.  Surely a 10/10 from me.  My wife and I came here for only 3 days on our honeymoon. I emailed them a few hours ahead of time asking if they could possibly decorate the room for me. The owner Harun responded quickly and sent me his personal number in case we had any issues arriving. When we checked in, they realized it was also my birthday the next morning and they surprised me with a cake for breakfast. All the staff were incredibly helpful and went over the top to provide great service. They also were very helpful in guiding us away from the tourist traps (they are everywhere) and gave us solid advice whenever we needed. Overall, I was blown away by the service, the breakfast and the ambience. The place was also very clean. The only slightly negative thing I could say about this place would be that the Excellent service and Harun is a wonderful host, guide and travel guru of Istanbul. The staff here are all well trained at hospitality and provide excellent service at check-in, during the stay and check out. It was our honeymoon and they treated us so lovely. It also was my husband\\'s birthday and they surprised him to celebrate! A unique touch that made our stay so special. The view from the veranda on the top floor is stunning, an unobstructed view of Aya Sofia and Bosphorus Bridge.  The location is also perfectly situated close to all the points of interest in the city. Thank you all!  The hotel owner Mr Harun and the staff found to be die hard hospitable caring for the every need of the guests.  The room service was found extremely prompt and supply items on just a call when needed. There was an immedıate solution for any need from taxı to  places. Even if confused they send their bellboy to the place nearby where you want to visit. Overall a very excellent experience at this hotel. Everthing about the hotel was exceptinal!!! Enes and his team provided outstanding service throughout my stay, starting from with a world-class welcome! I highly recommend s this hotel for its service and perfect location - a few steps from all the key sites and sights in old Istanbul. I will be recommending the White House Hotel to family and friends. Little cozy boutique hotel that makes you feel like home. Fantastic team was always there to help, the room was comfy and had everything one might need, location was perfect - just a few minutes walk to Agia Sophia and The Blue Mosque.  Impeccably clean and outstanding service from the private car from the airport to the day we checked out.  They helped with referrals around the city and reservations at a local restaurant.  don\\'t hesitate if you\\'re considering staying here. Excellent experience with the professional staff, the hotel is very clean, the location is great and close to any site I wanted to visit. I recommend it for anyone going to Istanbul for the first time, like I was.  He was very helpful and there was a really great team working from the first meeting at reception until the last appointment. It was a good experience. Good food and great atmosphere. I will definitely come back again'},\n",

Amazing view of Bosphorus and old city of İstanbul on 17 th floor and delicious buffet . Looking forward to stay in here again Swissôtel Bosphorus surpassed expectations! Special thanks to hostesses Busra and Eda, and receptionists Cagla and Chaymae. Exceptional service and warm hospitality. The staff\\'s dedication made our stay truly memorable. Highly recommend! Bushra and eda are very good people their hospitality kindness helpful caring . They were all the time around us asking what we need and how is our stay and if everything is ok and if anything is missing. I would recommend the stay in swiss and ask for bushra and eda As a travel agency, all our guests are satisfied with Swiss Hotel and their routes are always the same whenever they come to Turkey. Because the service, view and location of the hotel are very nice, I definitely recommend it. The best hotel in Istanbul Best hotel in Istanbul  Staff go out of there way to welcome you and your needs . Special mention to  Huseyin Engin  the gentleman who treated as so wonderfully at Breakfast he went out of his way , even if we were late for breakfast. I highly recommend him A beautifully appointed hotel with excellent staff. The pool and gym facilities are excellent as well as the Spa. We were upgraded to The Living Residence which was a separate Tower from the hotel. It was excellent. Room very spacious and accommodated myself and my 2 kids (aged 18&15 young adults) very well. It was serviced every day exceptionally well. View was excellent and grounds well maintained. It’s in a good location although if you are walking a bit of a hike up to the hotel. A special mention to Husseyin who looked after us so well at Breakfast. All in all a great stay. Thanks to the very friendly and excellent staff, especially Mrs. Büşra 🌹in the breakfast section of the restaurant.  The professional chef of the hotel with his wonderful breakfasts.  Very clean hotel with excellent service…  also we spent very dreamy moments on New Year\\'s Eve in this hotel😍🥰👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻 I had very nice experience,staff are very friendly there was a girl name bushra she was very helpful,rooms are clean ,breakfast have many varieties .there are many restaurants in the hotel ,spa is very nice  The experience at the breakfast was amazing specially busra in the main all day dining.she was attentive and very friendly. Even Husayn in executive lounge was really amazing and good attention.asena at bell desk reslly took care of us and helped us . The service and attention and the speed at this hotel is truly exceptional. A very nice hotel. Staff very friendly and helpful. Problem with house keeping when two rooms were not cleaned one day. It turns out you have to press a button for house keeping to clean your room. This was not explained in check in. However this was sorted. The staff in the leisure centre was second to  none, went above and beyond. Views of the Bosphorus Strait were outstanding, I could watch all day long.  The whole experience was perfect .  Staff , view , room , reception, concierge and of course location  Busra in the sabrosa restaurant is the best , she served people with a smile on her face  Glad to be here  The hotel is good but somehow stuck in 8 years ago, and it wasn\\'t worth the value, the stuff was ok. and parking the car is annoying progress. On the good side, the location is superb and the food is one of the best.  Honestly we are disapointed regarding the service that we recieved. First we did not settle in the same room class as was mentioned in our reservation (ADVANTAGE BOSPHORUS VIEW), but we had another type room with poor view and smoking odor (room no. 955); despite we sent a confirmation email in order to have everythig perfect at the time of our arrival to istanbul and hotel.  Secondly the reception did not give us the proper advices and told us that there is not any room available to change, however following our serious decision to abandon the hotel another manager changed our room.  For all these reasons due to this event which ruined our whole journey to istanbul, we highly not recomend this hotel to our friend Excellent service, great food, great staff. The room was very clean, second time we stayed here. Clean facilities, great pool, spa, and gym as well. Two hundred characters is a lot of words, but yeah the stay was great Good hotel but more expected from its price point especially cleaner bedsheets corridors lobby bar/cafe etc. Breakfast was nice but quality peers offer more range. Rather busy hotel so not for those seeking calm stay. Parking should be free for guests, paid 250 TL for a night. I have been member since 2002. Swiss Otel Bosphorus is my second home. Swiss Otel team became our family.  Executive Lounge; Songul , Gamze, Emine, Eray, Selam and rest of the team Sabrosa; Ozge ,Busra and and rest of the team Roof 16; Wonderful team Reception; warm welcome, incredible team Membership ; Sonay , Miray Spa; professional team For me and my husband we have second home and family here in Swiss Otel Thank you for everything Gulay & Malik Avunduk The food was delicious and Busra was very kind and helpful. Thank you for the good services Also the view is perfect and it’s really a beautiful nice place, I would repeat the experience over and over  :) Excellent hotel, clean and comfortable. Very quiet rooms. Nice location and an amazing view on Bosphorus.  Disliked · Had a quite unpleasant issue: one day we applied to the concierge of Swissotel and asked to book a table for a dinner. Concierge (name @MUJDAT BATILI) suggested ONLY ONE restaurant called \"PARK FORA\". He booked a table for us. We went there and were cheated well (the trick with different prices menus and wines). Really don\\'t want to believe that some guys from Swissotel are in \"a business\" with Park Fora restaurant cheaters. One of the best hotels of Istanbul. In a luxury area. We have spent about 4 days at the hotel and it was a great experience for us. It has a great access to the seaside and also luxury brands such as Hermes, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and other brands are near to the hotel. If you want to go to the Taksim street it takes only 5 minutes.  Breakfast quality is perfect. The behavior of the staffs is very good. A excellent, luxury, beautiful hotel. Super friendly and helpful staff, specially Ms Kardelen who was so kind. I really enjoyed my stay. The gym and pool were of very high quality in terms of facilities. Breakfast was very delicious as well. Hotel was perfect also staff is so kind. Especially Kardelen and Saliha from reception. We will come again. Restaurants and the rooms are very clean. We always come this hotel. We really love this places. A big THANK YOU to Büşra ve Melisa they have been so welcoming and helpful nothing is too much for them- they go out of their way to provide a service that is outstanding. The hotel is off the scale amazing . Apart from is panoramic Views of the Bosphorus it offers a customer service at a different level .Fabulous hotel.  Yes, I am very happy with my stay at Swiss Hotele! It is my favorite hotel in Istanbul! I always stay only here! Great location, great service, cozy, very friendly staff! Huge thanks to the Consierge Service headed by Adnan Bey, Sinan from Front Offisa, the whole Executive Lounge team! I highly recommend this hotel to everyone and will recommend it to my friends and family  Lyaman from Baku “Our” Swissôtel was great like always and therefore big thanks to everyone!!  It is always like coming home to dear family and we are always so happy to see our dear friends again, who all care about us perfectly! I would certainly like to write a more detailed comment about all the amazing venues and all the kind staff members in person, but this would fill too many pages, therefore today - representing all departments - a special thanks to the excellent Executive Lounge, where we had breakfast every day and went several times to the afternoon coffee or the aperitif buffet. Besides the delicious culinary offers we enjoyed the privacy, the unbeatable view on the 17th floor, the tasteful ambience and especially the very kind and attentive service very much!  I’m really sorry that Hotel is very amazing  service is excellent view is beyond perfect. You can find everything you need   Staff ia very helpful and lovely  Especially réception team Berk  he is very kind lovely and helpful  also Kamil and kardelen his colleagues were very nice. We chose Swiss The Bosphorus hotel for my visit this weekend. Everything started very well with the warm and friendly welcome of Mr. Mert from security at the entrance. Then we checked in and paid for our stay. Our room had a Bosphorus view and was a very nice room. (1205) I recommend it. All needs have been considered in the wonderful room. We had a very enjoyable dinner with the wonderful organization of Mr. Cumhur and Mr. Haluk at Chalet Garden, where we made a reservation in advance to taste Swiss local dishes for dinner. Everything was so good that we were very pleased. In the morning, we left the hotel after having breakfast at Sabrosa restaurant, accompanied by the view, with the beautiful attention of Ms. İrem. Thank you to all Swiss employees. You definitely need to Great hotel service, location, staff , breakfast restaurant sabrosa, Bushra did great job also Emre did great job , both help me and my family feel very special, I love this place , I am having wonderful experience The managers are sweet and accommodating but unfortunately this is not a true luxury property - more like 4 stars instead of 5. The hotel is outdated, both rooms and the lobby/common areas, and the staff in general need more training.  We gave Swissôtel a try but decided to move to the Four Seasons. My friends from England, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Dubai , in works , family , ask me about this hotel strat from staff until the stay( when they saw me at snapchat while i do cover the hotel .. and they tell me they plan to stay at the hotel  soon Food was nice and the service as well . The quality of the food is good and the vip was reflected the story and the culture of the restaurant . The DG was nice  Well done for them and wish this place all the best '},\n",

And I will plan to stay here again next visit,it is convenient location ,I enjoyed turkey ,Allah bless. My husband and I had a great stay at Primero hotel. When we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by Veysel who gave us coffee and plenty of guidance on how we could get to Istanbul's attractions -- which were mostly within walking distance from the hotel. Whenever we needed some help (like when we wanted an extra blanket, wanted to catch the sunrise, wanted to book a taxi to the hotel etc.), the hosts (Veysel, Sumir and so many more) would gladly assist us. We were also pleased with the breakfast and the cleaning service. It was all very professional and warm. A good stay, thanks to Primero hotel!   I have a good time at Primero. Staff was fantastic  I and my wife enjoyed the service specially Veysel And Samir  Breakfast service was really good with different tape of food . Room was always clean  We  enjoyed our time hotel and promised to come back our next holiday  Nice hotel with aesthetically pleasing colours. The staff are very hard working and the manager Mr. Ozgul was lovely. The hotel is located in a good location and there are many places and attractions to walk to just a few minutes away. Excellent hotel with walking access to all major attractions. Omer is a star host at this hotel. He helped me with everything I need and provided really valuable tips while I was in Istanbul.   Omer, you are awesome and thank you.  Came to Primero Hotel for 2 nights with my family! The hotel is a great location, 15 minutes walk to all the main Istanbul attractions. The staff were excellent, rooms were super clean and had all the amenities needed. Great hotel for a weekend or city trip. Omer was amazing, showed us all the places to go and always had a positive attitude 👍 definitely will visit again and thank you to Omer for making our stay special. Nice hotel, just a little hard to reach by car- But Ömer welcomed me very well from the moment I arrived at the hotel. His hospitality skills are top noch  If you want to get information about the city, you can consult Ömer. Thanks a lot for a great stay!! This hotel is located next to a cargo company and it doesn't have sound proofing.  There were big trucks coming and going all night.  Workers started their shifts before 4 am and they talked loudly.  It was impossible to sleep.  The furnishing was basic -  just a small writing desk with two small drawers.  There was a small closet with a bar fridge inside and thin slippers.  The problem was toilet paper.  The roll was so small that we had to ask for more every day.  Breakfast was okay.  The staff - it depends on which one.  Most of them weren't helpful and the information they gave was not reliable. We had a 3 nights stay at this hotel, for my husband’s birthday, and we were very satisfied with the accomodation. Omer and the entire staf has been very kind and helped us with everything we needed (airport transfer, Dervish Show reservations). Rooms have been cleaned every day. Breakfast was enought for all. They were so kind and brought my husband a cake in the evening, with a lighted candle and a birthday card. This was a great touch and also a wonderful surprise. Overall, a good place to stay, good value for money. The hotel is very close to all the important sight-seeing in Sultanahmet Area. close to Cemberlitas Tram station, Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia and Grand Bazaar (within ~10min walk). Rooms are very decent in size and very clean. Walk able to Topkapi Palace, Basilica Cistern. We met Veysel who helped us throughout the stay for three days with all the great options to visit around. He always had recommendation for us, which saves us money and time.  Thank you very much Veysel. We certainly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in Sultanahmet for few days. On the last day when we wanted to visit bus station on a friday evening, the traffic had major impact on getting the taxi. Another contact at hotel helped us in booking the taxi and picking us right from the hotel door. It We had a great stay at Primero Hotel!  Omer from the front desk was great in helping us with anything we asked and was very great to have conversation with him! Wish you all the beet!  We also want to say thank you to other front desk staff that were also great to us.  You all made our stay in Istanbul better! Thank you! The staff is awesome. Quick to respond to concerns. Hotel location is also superb, close to main attractions. Rooms are clean and A/C works great. Very pleased and highly recommend. Our host was Faisal and we strongly recommend you reach out to him. Very helpful and provided us with a lot of information.  We have arrived with our booked hotel transfer that took approx. 45-50 minutes to our hotel destination. The check-in was easy. As soon as we entered our room it had a nice smell in the air.   Very clean bed and bathroom especially the disposable bathing flops were a great add-on so our socks/shoes stay clean.  There has been a daily room cleaner who left everything clean.  The daily breakfast was tasty even though the room was small for a lot of visitors so there has been a time where we needed to come back later to get a table.   Mr. Veysel has been extra-ordinary kind and took his time to explain us everything we wanted to know and offered us some interesting trips.  He made sure we feel welcomed and at home. This is by far the best hotel I have ever been to in Istanbul.  The staff has been really nice to us especially Veysel Buluk and Omer Succin who has taken care of us from the check-in, check-out and the transfers.  I highly recommend this place. They take care of you like a family!   I will stay here again when I come back to Istanbul!  Stay here!!! 10 stars!!!!   El Primero Hotel exceeded all my expectations! I recently stayed there and would easily give it 5 stars. The staff were incredibly attentive and friendly specially VEYSEL, always ready to assist with any request. The room was beautifully decorated, clean, and had a comfortable bed. The hotel's location is fantastic, right in the heart of the city, making it convenient to explore. The on-site dining was also outstanding, with a variety of delicious options. I highly recommend El Primero Hotel for a top-notch stay. Everything about this hotel is absolutely amazing with the stuff you especially with Veysel. He’s the reason why I come to this hotel because he cares a lot about customer service. If it wasn’t for him, I wouldn’t be coming to this hotel. I highly recommend people come to this hotel because he is all about customer service. He will make sure that you are safe which is very important for the customer. Also the hotel is very beautiful as well. Thanks Veysel yasin and Omer  A+ hospitality at this hotel! Great location to all the tourist spots. Veysel was so helpful in his recommendations and very polite. He gave us a great, detailed explanation on the hotel offerings and is very professional.  We came from India and we spend at primero hotel 6 night and we love thé primero hotel an Breakfast was delicious and room was clean location near to grand bazaar an Blue mosquée and other touristik places,Thanks for everything Mr Veysel Have stayed at Primero multiple times and quality / value in terms of the hotel, location and staff is reflected in it’s deserved high rating. Special mention to Omer for his professionalism, assistance and recommendations on recent visits. We really enjoyed our stay here. Breakfast was great and only 7 min walk to grand bazaar. Special mention to Veysel. He was super friendly, professional and very helpful. We recommend. We walked to Grqnd Bazaar in 7 min and Blue Mosque in 10 min. Can’t wait to return to this city and hotel.                     We enjoyed our stay in this little boutique hotel in the heart of the historic Pennynsula of Istanbul.  It is central to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Cisterns, and Grand Bazar. Some other reviews complain about walking up hill.  Come on! You can not get any closer!  What could have been a disastrous experience, was very easy and enjoyable.  I made a reservation through credit card points for me and my sisters traveling from America (I reside in Turkey currently). I also had to make a separate reservation for my Uncle for a separate room.  I attempted to make the reservation through their direct website.  When we arrived, we discovered that the reservation did not go through.  Ugg.  We did not know what to do.  The intern there, Omer, went out of his way to find another room at The beginning was harder because some misunderstandings with the parking and the room, but due to Veysel help and patience everything was solved. Thank you Veysel for making our staying in Istanbul a great one.  Location was the best. Quiet street, walking distance to sulthanamet square and grand bazaar. If not in the mood to walk, the Tram station is minutes away from the outlet. Restaurants nearby. Very clean hotel, the receptionist is always there to help.  Cons: Breakfast while it was nice could use some variation now and then.  Shower area was very small so bit of a tight space there when you close the shower screens. We were told they had laundry service  but there was no laundry service but thankfully there is a laundry service a few blocks away.  Hotel really nice , clean bedrooms , veysel is very nice & welcoming. Helped us with anything we needed it .. thy take all yur luggage in yur rooms for yu , location is good all amenities near by , All attractions near by Istanbul is beautiful  Thank you for the excellent service. The reception staff was very professional and very helpful.  In addition, they were supportive in giving guidance about the different places to visit in Turkey. They are accurate in their information and generous in there room services.    Receptionist Faisal was very helpful and accommodating. He helped with tours and transportations . He helped recommending places to go to such as restaurants and places to visit. In general our stay was very pleasant and definitely will be back.  Best hotel I ever stayed in Istanbul,we stayed at primero hotel for several nights and we really like this service so breakfast was delicious and room was very clean,location is near to all major places What a fantastic experience! The team at the hotel are absolutely spot on and hugely customer oriented. Nothing is too much trouble! Veysel even printed my boarding card. Location of hotel is perfect!  Will definitely be staying again!!!! It's a good hotel.   We got a moderately spacious 4-bed room, but the shower was rather small. The hotel staff (esp Veysel) was very accommodating and friendly. The biggest advantage was the proximity to all the historical places in Sultanahmet (Topkapi, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Basilica Cistern, and all the touristy spots).   Having been pampered with personalized kahvalti (breakfast) at our hotels in Selçuk and Kayseri, the breakfast at this hotel (and possibly many of the hotels in Istanbul) while decent, leaves a bit to be desired. Stayed in this hotel for three nights while on a family vacation. Rooms are a bit small but very modern and clean. Location is wonderful and very convenient to shops and the historical sites such as the Aya Sophia and the Blue Mosque. Staff was so friendly, especially when helping us find taxis and organizing transportation -- they went above and beyond. Breakfast is below average to average quality, but not a dealbreaker as free breakfast is just an added benefit.\"},\n",

The team is very nice and helpful, ready fto give good recommendations anytime. At the very outset, I would like to apologise the team for my unintentional delay in writing my review !  I am apologising as after my one week stay in this awesome hotel, during end of August 2023, I have developed a some sort of friendly or may even extended family type feeling towards this fabulous team of this hotel.. such was their warm hospitality.   This was my first visit to Istanbul, and I was actually bit worried about my choice of this hotel, which I selected completely based on TripAdvisor reviews !  But, to my pleasant surprise, right from the word go during my arrival in the hotel, all the staffs were extremely friendly, cooperative, warm, informal, decent and sensitive as well as sensible, towards all my queries/requests, even at odd hours.   Additionally, this From the time you finalize your booking, the hotel team commence their exceptional service. WhatsApp messages are sent arranging transfers and providing advice as you finalize your activities. The hotel is perfectly situated just off one of the main shopping roads that leads down to the Galata Tower. We were fortunate to be upgraded to a deluxe room which was well appointed and equipped. The bed was one of the most comfortable we have slept on during our frequent travels and the bathroom was perfect.  The hotel team and especially Mustafa were exceptional in every way and nothing was to much trouble.   Best test of a good visit is that we will definitely return when next in Istanbul! Great location and a great Team. Fatih and Mustafa go the extra mile to accomodate you. The hotel is 50 meters from a fanstastic shopping road. Possibly the best one in istanbul. Lovely rooms. If you can afford it go for the Terrace one.  We were there for 5 nights as a family from september 11 - 18/ 2023. We were having the best service, with communicative, helpful & good english speaking staffs. Best location, on the heart of istanbul, in the street of Istiklal. Easy access to stores on istiklal & restaurants on Asmali mescit. The staff are very helpful & provided excellent service during our stay. We had a duplex studio which was very comfortable & spacious for 3 ppl I was looking for something that was close to the cruise port.  The hotel the Crystal Travel agent recommended was way too expensive for the one night I needed to stay.  I found the Hotel Story on my own and was very happy that I did.  They arranged for a car to pick me up at the airport. The location was less than ten minutes from the cruise port in a central location to shops, restaurants and a Catholic church.  The staff, especially Ms. Ekin and Mr. Ihsan were quite courteous and helpful. They suggested restaurants and even arranged for a personal tour guide to take me around the old city and Bazaar.   Suleyman Kilinc was an excellent guide, quite knowledgeable and friendly.  He made me feel very welcome. When I go back, I will definitely look to stay here again. The hotel is near to the center of the İstiklal Caddesi. Great service team with a lot of patience and good advices for places to go for. We received a WIFI transmitter that save us money for buying a local sim card. I enjoyed my visit there and will go back at my next visit to Istanbul    Hotel location is perfect - near the main istiklal street with many food and shopping outlets. Public transport links via the tram and Metro are within walking distance - which makes journeys across Istanbul easier and cheaper. The team provided a great service, always willing to give advice and the complimentary remote Wi-Fi box was a pleasant and valuable service.  Rooms are spacious and opposite the hotel is a great breakfast place.  I’d recommend this hotel based on its location and customer service. This boutique hotel is brilliantly located only 10 metres from the main pedestrian walkway in Pera. The rooms are spacious and very well appointed. Our room had a large balcony with a sensational view of the harbour. The service offered by the front office staff was outstanding. I travel extensively and I have not experienced this level of personalised support at any other hotel. I highly recommend this hotel.                                         '},\n",

A first class hotel in a perfect location that treats its guests with a caring outlook.  Everything about this hotel was fantastic! Comfortable rooms and location, excellent breakfast, and amazing attention from all staff members. We loved the hotel so much that when we circled back to Istanbul, we decided to stay there again. We hope to return in the future.  Hotel Amira, Where to start?  After a long flight from Australia, the Hotel Manager took us down to breakfast and then later returned with a map of Istanbul, for our questions and to give us directions for tours the next day. Incredibly helpful. As was all the staff in this Hotel. The hotel is so central we were able to walk to the Blue Mosque, The Hagia Sophia Grand Mosque, so on the first day we walked to these magnificent buildings four times. Why not?? People we met on our tour the next day were staying much farther away and regretted their choice. Don\\'t go further than the Rooftop Restaurant/Bar at Hotel Amira. We ventured out on the first night and at great expense and disappointment vowed we wouldn\\'t again. The food in the Rooftop Restaurant/Bar is delicious and the The staff at Hotel Amira are unforgettable. They’ve been so kind, accommodating and fun. We love chatting with everyone who works here and getting their local tips for exploring the city. My partner describes their customer service as second to none.  Breakfast was delicious with the option of specialty bread made to order. Amazing.   Great gym in the basement.   Rooms are comfortable with great beds and pillows. We had a gorgeous balcony and spent a lot of our time there. The rooftop bar/cafe is also stunning.   Can’t wait to return - love Hotel Amira! The Hotel Amira is located in the perfect spot...within walking distance to the Grand Bazaar and Blue Mosque. We got a balcony room which provided a nice spot for coffee in the mornings overlooking the city.  Breakfast was included and also peovided a woman baking local bread, made to your specific order. But the real crown of this hotel is its front desk employees. ...1000% the best! One of the best hotel experiences for us.. The staff is so warm and friendly.. Mr Sam and Serkan were both always available to guide and help us at every step.. Their genuine care for all their customers is simply great.. The rooms are absolutely clean and this really felt like a home away from home for us.. I highly recommend this hotel to every traveler looking for a great experience  Would recommend to anyone visiting Istanbul for the the first time. The location is very central to most of the main sites! The staff was very friendly and helpful. They provided us with complimentary bottled waters every day and the breakfast buffet was delicious. We loved the lady who made gozleme 3 of the 4 mornings we were there as well. My husband and I agree the bed was the most comfortable of the 5 hotels we stayed in on our Turkey trip. Excellent hotel with impeccable service. Our host, Ender, on the rooftop terrace was superb and made sure our group always had fun and kept our glasses full!! Hotel is close to all the bucket list sites. Would definitely stay at Amira Hotel again.  Ender is amazing! Excellent and very attentive service. I would love to stay here longer but my trip is already planned. The rest of the staff is great but Ender went above and beyond   I hope to come back.  Stayed here with my daughter on holiday.  The place is stunning, but more than that, the staff are amazing, so helpful, and told us where to be the best restaurants and how to get around  Instanbul. We highly recommend you come here you will not be disappointed.   This was our first visit to Istanbul and we couldn\\'t have chosen a better hotel.  Its location in the Sultanahmet district is perfect, within easy walking distance of Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosque, the  16th century Hamami baths (well worth a visit), and the awesome Basilica Cistern. The hotel\\'s unique architecture comprises two typical Turkish residences joined by an atrium and creating a small, friendly hotel full of character. Special attractions are the Turkish breakfasts, the great rooftop bar for evening drinks and snacks overlooking the Bosphorus, and the smiling, incredibly helpful youthful staff who helped us plan our five days, book a guide, a river cruise, airport transport, and discover some fun local restaurants in the surrounding cobbled laneways, where we also Upon arrival, I quickly learned how spectacular Hotel Amira’s location is. The hotel is walking distance to a variety of Istanbul’s most iconic attractions like Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Basilica Cistern, and many others. My room was incredible, with a private rooftop deck and wonderful views of Istanbul and the water. The breakfast was delicious with classic breakfast foods and authentic Turkish specials. Service was delightful, all staff were so friendly and helpful, and the bar on the roof was breathtaking. As a native New Yorker who has done plenty of traveling in Europe, this had to be one of the most special stays I have had in the past few years. Hotel Amira is in an excellent location in Fatih, right near the heart of the old city with major attractions all within walking distance. It has a spectacular rooftop terrace/lounge area where you can soak up the views of the Bosphorus River, surrounding mosques and eclectic local architecture.  Inside, the hotel is dated but well-presented and clean. Staff are exceptionally polite and helpful.  They were keen to assist with tours and bookings; we did opt out of some more expensive offerings.  Breakfast choices are plenty and we particularly loved the in-house gozleme chef who prepared gozleme to order every morning using traditional Turkish method.  We had two inter-connected rooms being a family of 5, which was terrific. There was also a small gym.  Overall, very comfortable Excellent stay, would highly recommend. The staff were very welcoming, friendly and helpful. The location is extremely convenient to downtown Sultanahmet (just 5 min walk).  Breakfast was excellent, we enjoyed the homemade pita bread.  Thank you for having us. We loved the Amira -- perfect location for visiting sites in the Sultanahmet, great breakfast buffet, and our comfortable room had a balcony with a stunning view looking out on the Sea of Marmara.  Staff helped arrange tours and meals.  Would definitely stay here again next visit. Our two days here were so wonderful during a long stopover that we were sad to move on to our main destination. Rooms are immaculate and well-designed and the included breakfast is EXCELLENT. The location is right in the center of everthing, and the staff is just wonderful - friendly and helpful. And the rooftop restaurant has an incredible view of the Bosphorus and and of the Blue Mosque. Delighted we can come back for one more night at the end of the trip. We loved this charming and unusual hotel, its great location and lovely roof terrace with stunning view of the Bosphorus.  Special mention should go to the charming and helpful reception staff, who organised a guide, boat trip and restaurants for us.  We felt really comfortable and at home, and we’re sorry to leave. All I can say is that our experience with Hotel Amira was exceptional! Right from dealing with Nezahat when emailing backwards and forwards from New Zealand through to make reservations and book cultural tours to daily being met by Serkan (Manager), Sam and Ali to make sure everything was okay.  We could not have had better service or dealt with nicer people! Thank you all so much for giving us an awesome experience of Istanbul. The accommodation was great, breakfast superb and staff amazing, thoroughly recommend this hotel and can’t wait to come back. The reception desk staff are very professional, the breakfast is excellent and the room is very comfortable. Highly recommendable. The location is ideal for tourists for you can walk to many touristic places. Amazing 2 nights as an extended stopover. Hotel was perfectly located near great attractions. Front desk helped outline a great itinerary for us around the city with clear instructions including how to use public transportation. The included breakfast was delicious particularly the freshly made bread custom to order. Highly recommend. We stayed here in July 2023 for 4 nights prior to our cruise and couldn\\'t have chosen a better hotel.  The staff are welcoming and incredibly knowledgeable, and we were able to walk to many sites within 10-20 minutes.  The breakfast was fresh and delicious, and we ate dinner at the rooftop terrace enjoying a great view of the Bosphorus.  A super place to stay. This is a boutique hotel in the middle of the old city. Is is within walking distance of all of the main attractions,  the Hippodrome,  the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and so on. The hotel is clean and modern,  the staff are competent and incredibly accomodating.. I would stay there again. I stayed at Hotel Amira for 7 nights in August 2023. From the minute I arrived the staff were courteous, helpful, and professional. The team at the concierge desk assisted with an airline issue immediately upon check-in and continued to assist with things like taxi negotiations, going above and beyond throughout my stay. Staff in the restaurant and breakfast room were quick to learn coffee orders and offer a friendly hello, small things that go a long way. Housekeeping staff did an impressive job each day and are often forgotten in reviews, so I wanted to acknowledge how clean and well-maintained the room was. I had a street level room and was worried at first, but double-paned windows kept out the noise. \\xa0The hotel is in Sultanahmet near many tourist attractions and within a Having travelled to MANY countries around the world and currently living in Dubai, I can summarise this hotel in a positive light with this statement:- \"The facilities of the hotel are ok but the customer service is world-class.\"  Yes at this price point I would recommend the owners to tweak little things like the quality of the pillows, bedsheets, and air conditioning definitlely.   However, each of the front staff went out of their way to make my trip that extra bit special:- - advice: provided local tips on recommendations - medicine: had an upset stomach one night and they came right away with a selection of medicine for me to choose which was fantastic  - from providing umbrellas when it\\'s raining to providing plug adapters  Had a brilliant stay and recommend to anyone who Beautiful hotel, amazing staff and service during our stay. We originally were staying for 2 nights but they were happy to add an extra night for us. Hotel reception staff went above and beyond our expectations with helping us to get taxis with a good price, recommendations and booking assistance. Breakfast was delicious, buffet style with different options each day and a large variety. A lovely woman makes fresh borek (flat pastry with fillings), that was a great start to our trip, setting the bar very high. The rooftop restaurant had a stunning view and great bartenders. Prices on menus are in Euros, it is the same in most of the touristy places in Turkiye I later realised, so not much of a shock to me anymore. The room was clean, homey and comforting for our first nights in I booked with the hotel directly many months ago!   Thought I’ll write my review as a warning to others.   I decided to book directly through the hotel website and thought that would come with its own privileges, like many other hotels provide, however I was greatly mistaken.   I have no idea why, I was given a side room (306 I believe) which isn’t even listed in the elevator of the hotel and the signage. Also you don’t have a direct access to the hallway, and all other rooms do. That rang some alarm bells. After peaking in other rooms at the hotel, whilst cleaning is being conducted, it appeared I was given the most Garbage Room in the hotel. IF YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN THAT ROOM, IMMEDIATELY REQUEST FOR ANOTHER OR CANCEL!   On the first night I noticed stains on the bed sheet and Highly recommended. The staff was tremendously friendly and eager to please us in every way. In particular, brothers Serkan and Volkan [front desk] should be commended for their invaluable assistance in helping us to book taxi, tour and restaurant reservations, and in general, making our trip to Istanbul, an  unforgettable experience. The hotel staff arranged transportation from the airport which was so helpful.  The hotel is lovely.  All of the staff are so friendly, efficient and helpful.  They respond so quickly to questions or requests.  Our beautiful room was large with a beautiful balcony.  View of the Sea of Marmara.  The rooftop bar was a lovely place to eat dinner.  We enjoyed the food and could watch the sunset.  Views of the sea and of the Blue Mosque.  Great location.  Just a 10 minute walk to historic sites.  5 minutes to the sea. Breakfast included.  Special treat was the delicious freshly made Gozleme--stuffed flatbread. We had a wonderful stay and would love to visit again. This place is the real deal. We travelled in a group of 8. We were there for about 5 nights which was great. They were super helpful, taking time to walk me through all the places we should visit on the trip.   They were super helpful with arranging taxis and reserving the Turkish bath for us as well.   The breakfast was incredible. The rooftop restaurant was also very nice with an incredible view.    While the whole trip, I felt like I was walking on eggshells to make sure nobody was scamming me, the people at Amira were so honest and kind and truly amazing people. It was really the highlight of our trip and I cannot say enough nice things about our experience here. The rooms were amazing. The customer service and attention to detail was really top notch.   Thanks again Amira. I booked this hotel based on the reviews,  it was disappointed. My room’s floor was covered with an old carpet which smelled of humidity five minutes after turning off the AC. I didn’t have bath towels in the room and I got attitude from a bell boy (who spoke in Turkish to his colleague so I wouldn’t understand) because I told him I didn’t need help with the luggage. Won’t come back .'},\n",

The location was fabulous - walking distance to all the main sites.  Great size room and spotlessly clean. Staff really went extra mile to help you.  Breakfast was delicious. We stayed for three nights at Mula Hotel (Hammam Suite and Blue Mosque Suite) in August with our three children.  Our stay could not be better.  Very comfy, spacious and clean rooms, good cooked breakfast, unbeatable location and outstanding customer care. We had some complex requests, like ordering a custom-made birthday cake (Afra not only handled our communication with the local bakery but actually drove her car to collect the cake for us!), booking a private boat tour and retrieving a mobile forgotten on that boat - all were handled by the hotel staff very quickly and professionally.  Many thanks to Afra and her colleagues at the reception for the very warm and personalised attention. If we come back to Istanbul for another stay, we would most certainly stay at this hotel - Excellent ! The attention to customer details was amazing. Very friendly staff and the service was promt and perfect. Only regret was to spend only one night there. I would have loved to spend more time there. This is definitely a hotel that out to make an impression for comforting it's customers. Bravo! If you are looking for beautiful stayed-in hotel with nice and friendly staff, Mula hotel is the one. Thanks for them that my long waiting holiday will be remembered. I stayed for 10 days with breakfast included and each day different unique breakfast.

Kind and helpful staff! Also the breakfast was amazing! Literally the best we have had.  Rooms were spacious and comfortable!  Overall highly recommend and will defo stay at this hotel again!  The Mula hotel is a great hotel with an exceptional focus on service. Lots of staff, very attentive to any detail, super friendly and service minded. We were treated as royals.   The breakfast is great value for money!  Besides the buffet you can request the kitchen a wide variety of dishes, all included in breakfast fee.   We had the Junior Suite with sea view for family of 4.  Spacious enough for us, modern, mattress quality very good.   Location outstanding! 5 minute walk from Blue Mosque in tranquil and safe alley, surrounded by restaurants.   We will be back for sure. Amazing experience with this hotel! they provide an atmosphere like you’re at your own home with 10 stars services. All the staff was great especially Afra very kind knowledgeable with a smile, beautiful outdoor breakfast with very highly quality food selections, and patio area with an amazing views, great location you can have 5 to 10 minutes walk to the most beautiful landmarks like Ayasofya and sultan Ahmed historical mosques. Highly recommended !!  What can I say, i wish i can live in this hotel forever. The team make you feel like an Ottoman Sultan from the 15th century.. the scent in the recepion area is so beautiful it makes u want to come back to the hotel as soon as possible :)  Always smiling, always there to help, the level of personalized service in this hotel is something i havent’ seen in many luxurious hotels or palaces around the world.

Special thanks to Mr Agah Okay for his advice We will definitely return Very nice, clean Botique hotel. Staff is amazing, really helpful. They go above and beyond to help you . Location is excellent . 10 minutes to main attractions like Hagia Sophia , Blue mosque and Topkapi palace. 1 minute walk to Tram station. Lot of good restaurants in the area. The hotel was extremely beautiful, very Ottoman like, close to Hagia Sofia. The staff was exceptionally welcoming and kind hearted with us. They made us feel like we are part of the family and that amazed us. I definitely recomand the place!🤗🤗🥰🥰 This quaint hotel is in the perfect location.  On the European side of Istanbul, we could easily walk to Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, and the Cisterns.  I highly recommend it, especially for its location.  They serve a great breakfast buffet every morning and tea and sandwiches in the afternoon.  The elevators are very small, and the rooms are also quite small but really lovely.   Sirkeci Mansion Hotel is a historic building in the heart of Istanbul’s historic district. The staff go out of their way to help, and it is very clean. It is a removers old building, which makes it charming, but also means a tight elevator and tight stairway. Rooms of the first level above streets do not receive much sun, which was not an issue as we spent most of our time exploring. Multiple options at the breakfast buffet. Would stay again if I visit Istanbul Hotel has a great location. near the Gulhame Tram and the marmaray was less than 100 m away … The breakfast was a bit disappointing hoped to have more options .. The rooms are a bit dated .. Attractions nearby is the Blue mosque , Gulhame Park and Cistern Basillica .. The manager Agah was very helpful .. Enjoy We were fortunate to find this gem of a hotel after a late change in our booking plans caused us to book on two separate dates and incorrectly cancel the redundant one. Fortunately the manager Okay Alkan was able to accommodate us and provide us a very comfortable room. We were also loaned a transit card which we ended up using often since the tram station is only a very short walk away. Most of the major tourist and cultural sites from the Grand Bazaar to Hodjapasha to Karakoy are well within walking distance but the tram made them much more convenient. Our room was peacefully quiet and comfortable, especially (and most importantly) the bed. The bathroom is rather retro with its cross-arm faucet handles but everything was in working order. We have already recommended this hotel This hotel is in a an excellent location for sight seeing and the staff went above and beyond to help us in every way. We arrived early, they kept our bags, got our room ready early and  put the bags in the room after they gave us a suggestion of where to visit while we waited. Cannot say enough about how helpful they were. Room was beautiful and they had a treat for us on our bed when we checked in.  This hotel was a joy to me and my daughter. We felt so looked after by all the lovely staff, after 5 nights we felt we were leaving family. It’s small, in a brilliant location, friendly , helpful, clean , comfortable and there are great extras like a cooking class , a swimming pool and spa. This place made our stay in  Istanbul memorable.  This place is fabulous and the location is excellent. In busy Istanbul this is a quiet street. Great to sleep and rest. This street has great shop to find everything you need at good prices. Gulhane Spice, on the same block down the street from the hotel is particularly good.                     Ideally located, walking distance to all major sites in the old part of the city. We spent 5 days there and toured the city daily with a guide. Excellent staff and spa facilities. Great gym. Cocktails every evening on the roof with great views. The breakfasts had excellent variety and changed daily. I would definitely come back.  The hotel was in an excellent position surrounded by shops selling a variety of goods with very friendly, NOT pushy, shopkeepers.  Only a short walk to Hagia Sofia and Blue Mosque with many restaurants and cafes nearby and on the way. ALL STAFF were very friendly, at reception, at breakfast, and in the rooftop bar which was a lovely place for a pre-dinner drink. The room was very comfortable  well-supplied with bottled water, toiletries and the air conditioning was easy to work. Only one thing which would have been helpful was a USB port for charging our phones, but that\\'s only because we were short of adaptors. Breakfast was very good with a vast array of dishes, cold and hot. And over our 3 day visit it seemed the hot dishes were never the same. I would thoroughly recommend Sirkeci Mansion is perfectly located in the old area of Istanbul. We walked to the Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sofia, Gulhane Park, the Grand Bazaar, the Spice Market and to the Bosphorus River for a river cruise. There are so many restaurants a few steps from the hotel and shopping all around.  The staff are very welcoming and so helpful in giving directions and recommendations. We arrived after 10 pm and they quickly booked a table for us in a nearby rooftop restaurant which was a great start to our stay. Breakfast is delicious. We highly recommend this hotel. I really wanted to like this hotel after so many reviews.  I was delighted to score this hotel.   I hope for others we had a one off experience.  I will say the location was fabulous.  You can walk to all major sights within 10 minutes.  Restaurants and cafes around every corner.  Walk to the waterfront and Galata Bridge in 15 minutes. Only one person on staff (Aras?) and wait staff in restaurant were friendly and welcoming.  Everyone else looked like they hated our jobs.  When we changed our mind about a private taxi to airport (5 hours prior to departure time) we were scolded by the man at reception that booked it.  His price was 200 tl This hotel is located steps away from the trams that operate more frequently than public transportation in large cities around the world. The area is full of restaurants that are touristy but serve good tasting food. There are plenty of smaller old city type of shops right around the hotel.. The hotel feels safe and the staff is just incredibly helpful and quick to respond to any request. We were very impressed by one of the duty managers, Aras, and by the smiling lady who was the key to thier buffet breakfast service. So I want to give an honest review of this boutique hotel. When I first arrived, it was very unassuming and I thought I might have a made a mistake in coming, however I had just arrived from traveling with my son (10) about 13 hours and so gave it a chance. I’m glad I did because in the end I thought this was an amazing hotel and experience (after spending three nights). While this is not a luxury hotel (set your expectations accordingly), it more than makes up for it in other ways.   First and foremost, the staff were absolutely wonderful (especially Okay and Fatima) who treated us so well. They made us feel like family (they got to know us, offered us special apricot cake made by the manager, made non-touristy recommendations, got us cherry juice at breakfast everyday - which Only just got back today from Istanbul. Stayed at serkeci mansion.  Location is perfect. Walking distance to sultanamet blue mosque hagia sofia. Metro literally on doorstep. Great walks around the area and beyond.  All hotel staff extremely friendly and made us feel welcome. Clean rooms. Hotel staff helped with tours available around area. Supplied with tourist sim card. Breakfast was great. Had everything we needed. Staff at breakfast were lovely and welcoming. Service was great.  Loved the shops around the area too. The shop keepers really friendly.  My boys would walk across shop to buy drinks and snacks.  Was sad to leave as I enjoyed my stay.  Would definitely come back to this hotel next time.  Thank you so much serkeci mansion team for everything. I will recommend to my We spent 3 nights at the Sirkeci Mansion Hotel and cannot say enough about their welcoming hospitality. Our room overlooking the quaint street below and the gardens beyond set the scene for our 3 day visit. Mr. Okay Agah Alkan and the rest of the staff were very helpful in putting us at our ease in this warm, inviting hotel. The breakfasts were wonderful and plentiful, with honey from a fresh honeycomb. The rooftop bar area was perfect for watching the nesting herons while enjoying a beer. The perfect ending before boarding our ship was my hammam experience at the hotel spa. Definitely recommend the foam scrub and massage. Also, the hotel is within an easy walk to the main tourist sites in Sultanahmet.  Don\\'t look any further, this is your hotel in Istanbul. Sandra and Donald, What a wonderful little hotel! Please do stay there. The location is ideal to explore Istanbul\\'s main attractions. There are also many little stores and restaurants around with great deals for tourists. The tram runs nearby and you can follow the tracks for better locating yourself in the city. But the best thing about Sirkeci, besides being clean and charming, is the staff. How friendly and nice these people are! They will do anything to make you happy, and in a very approachable, fun way (no place for snobbery here). To top it all, the breakfast is also delicious. My friends and I were very happy with our stay. We travel quite a bit as a family ( 2 children ages 7 and 12 ) but don’t always review. This hotel deserves every accolade we could provide. We had a family connecting room which was great and a perfect amount of space for all. Having two bathrooms was a real plus! Beds were comfortable and the room servicing was impeccable. The people go above and beyond, are incredibly kind and hospitable. The hotel is very well kept, clean, and has such a special charm. It is perfectly located to everything in the Old Town and has a beautiful terrace to sit on and enjoy the view of the Bosphorus. We would sit out at night and watch the sun set with a glass of wine and Fanta for the kids. The breakfast is wonderful and excellent quality. Have it included in your stay if you can. It is worth This hotel is clean and customer oriented, while being accessible and at a few steps from Hagia Sophia and Topkapi (5 min walk). It is quiet and the service is really excellent in a country where good customer service is not common. We stayed there for two nights and even got an upgrade. The breakfast are very good and traditional. Totally recommended.  This was the best hotel in which I have stayed during a three month tour of Europe. Second time I have stayed here... First of all, the staff. All of them super-friendly, very helpful and efficient. Special mention to Okay, whom I remember from my stay in 2013, and who gave us excellent tips for visiting the places of interest, also Fatme who looked after us so well at the (excellent) breakfasts. Secondly the actual hotel. A wonderful traditional mansion with large rooms, unusual in hotels in a capital city, and a cool, welcoming oasis in the heart of the old city. Fantastic rooftop terrace with bar and food. A hammam, pool, Turkish bath, sauna... perfect! And thirdly, its position in the heart of the old city ensured that everything was within a 15 minute walk. Great Hotel is located superbly, right near a Tram station from one side, but also within a walking distance for all attractions of the Old City. Staff is extremely nice, helpful in many ways - also helped me to communicate in Turkish with our taxi driver who was a little late to take us back to airport. Breakfast is good, nice variety to start the day. Highly recommended. This oasis of peace and hospitality nestles by the park in the heart of the Old Town sites. Everyone on the staff is welcoming and helpful, making this feel like a home away from home. The breakfast buffet was enormous with offerings changing daily, living up to the fame of Turkish breakfasts. Daily activities (all free)  offer guests a glimpse into the culture and history of Istanbul, including a tour of the Golden Horn neighborhood and a cooking class with the chef. Evenings at the rooftop bar were a perfect way to relax, watching  birds fly in and out of the park and listening to the wind through the trees. Everything exceeded our expectations! From the moment we walked into the hotel, to the moment we left, we were almost treated like royalty. Though one may think good customer service is nothing out of the norm, it can be in Istanbul, I know this having visited the city numerous times.   The warm welcome, drinks, smiling faces, and general vibe in the hotel was wonderful. The reception is small, however Okaiy at reception more than makes up for this. He was perceptive and engaged positively with every single customer he spoke to. He was always happy courteous and willing to help.   The Hotel has all the facilities of larger neighbouring hotels but at a slightly smaller scale. It is very clean, and well kept, the room and bathroom were clean and  well maintained. The location is superb and central to everything. The Very much agree with the other posts about location being very good. Really loved how central it was in the Old Town and so walkable to everything and close to buses and trams if needed. We walked to Galata Tower, which was a nice walk over the bridge and was glad we had decided to stay where we did.  The one small caveat I would have was that the bathroom was tiny! The shower was actually a normal size, but the vanity was so small and squished so that you could not shut the door. It seemed too narrow by about 10-12 inches, so that right when you walked into the bathroom, you were 10\" away from the sink. It made me a bit claustrophobic, and I have stayed in some rooms with small bathrooms.   The rooms was a nice size and the view of Gulhane park was really nice in the mornings. Returned for another stay at this wonderful hotel. Good location. Comfortable clean spacious room with a  large balcony overlooking Gulhane Park. The staff are as always terrific. So hospitable & helpful. Try out a treatment at the hamman, worth it. Take one of their  complimentary guided tours. So interesting. Great breakfast choice.  Great little hotel in an excellent location near Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace etc but on a quiet street with nice little shops to browse. Gulhane tram stop is a minute walk up the street. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were comfortable, there is a  good Turkish style breakfast and welcome snacks and tea in the afternoon after a day out in Istanbul. Try to get a room with a balcony looking over the street and the nearby Gulhane park.  Our first hotel in Turkey after a long flight and it was a wonderful soft landing for us. Great location, kind and helpful staff, comfortable room. Our room had a balcony and it was really nice. The hotel is near Ghulane (sp?) Park and it was lovely to wind down there after a day of sightseeing to people and cat watch!  I typically don’t leave reviews but my stay was so great that I have too! Not only is the hotel well located in the old city (walking distance to blue mosque, haiga sofya mosque, and many more) but the staff makes you feel at home! The staff is always happy and extremely helpful. And the furniture of the hotel is beautiful! Highly recommend it! '},\n",

Lovely rooms, lobby, fantastic restaurant and breakfast room with a view on the Bosporus. Service is 100% top notch, you cannot ask for more when in Istanbul. It is like an oasis in a buzzing town Food at Nicole was really worth one Michelin star. The Turkish breakfast and the service that comes with it is simply superior. Excellent hotel with very friendly staff. Great location to old city and shopping area. Very friendly staff. Rooms are clean with great space. Fantastic roof terrace with nice view over the sea. Breakfast is on the rooftop with a nice choice I took advantage of a free stopover in Istanbul on our way to Nairobi. The “Small Luxury Hotel of the World” Tomtom suites proved to be a smart choice and was excellent in all respects. This hotel offers personalized service and exquisite accommodations in a charming and “walkable”  neighborhood.  Their airport transfer added to our seamless stopover experience. The added bonus of the Michelin-starred rooftop restaurant “Nicole” made our last evening a grand finale. I would not hesitate to book my VIP clients here as a perfect base for an Istanbul adventure. Very good. I recommend for everybody this hotel. It is a 5* experience from design to room to bed to breakfast. Location is fantastic and staff is very friendly and helpful. On the top of hotel there is michelin restaurant - breakfast is in the restaurant premises Excellent and very well located hotel. We had a great 4 nights here which were very comfortable. Excellent friendly, helpful staff. Very well located and very quiet and Galata etc easily walkable up the hill. It's also very easy to walk down the hill towards the harbour and catch a tram there. We didn't eat in the restaurant, but the breakfast (and the waiters) were very good. Excellent view out over the Bosphorus. Would I go again? Definitely. From the warm welcome onwards, my husband,  teenager and I had an tremendous stay. Our suites were beautifully appointed and  comfortable (bed and pillows are amazing - and i am an extremely poor sleeper but slept unusually well, helped in part by the quiet street), the bathrooms spacious and luxurious.  The complimentary afternoon tea was delightful after a days “touristing”. The staff were wonderful - informative, helpful and friendly (a special mention to the breakfast team). We will be trying hard to return! My husband and I stayed at the Tomtom suites recently and I could not have loved it more: - fantastic personal service - they get to know you and help you with restaurant recommendations, rides, etc - the location is perfect - close to the train station, Istiklal street, the river, etc but in a quiet location since no traffic is allowed in front of the hotel - wonderful breakfast where the breakfast manager is happy to serve  It’s a boutique hotel that makes you feel special.  I’d love to go back one day!  Covenient location and central to all amenities, this little gem offers a welcome and stay that are fit for enchanting city of Istanbul.The staff are simply amazing.Would definitely come back to this hotel. Beautiful hotel, in a trendy neighbourhood near cool shops and restaurants, the staff is super friendly and helpful especially the manager during breakfast. Our suite was comfortable and spacious, and we looked forward to have breakfast every morning! Highly recommended.                      The best breakfast and amazing service. Our room was enormous and sumptuous. Well located and a short walk to the port shopping and art gallery down the road. Walk through the local area for great restaurants and shopping. Located in a quiet secluded area opposite the Italian embassy and an Italian school . The road is blocked by bollards so you sometimes need to walk to the end of the road if meeting transport. Had an absolutely fantastic 4 nights stay celebrating my wife’s 50 birthday in this amazing hotel. The staff were out of this world, especially Sinan, at reception who was always very helpful, welcoming and would do everything possible. The staff at breakfast were very helpful and breakfast was superb. Every afternoon from 4pm - 6pm there was complimentary tea/coffee, fruit and fresh pastries, which was delightful after visiting the city each day. The locality was very quiet but very close to all the main sites which were within walking distance. We will definitely return. Hotel staff are very sweet and accommodating. They spoke great English and helped us with our plans.   The neighborhood has nice shops and restaurants within walking distance.   Overall a great hotel!  Great location.  A small, boutique hotel with gentle, helpful staff.  Big, big rooms.  The hotel organised our transport.  The staff recommendations for places to eat was perfect.  I would happily stay again. We had the most wonderful experience in Tom Tom Suites from the moment we set foot into the lobby. I cannot speak highly enough of their staff, who embraced us so warmly, offering to do anything in their capacity to ensure our comfort. Mr Sinal is the hallmark of hospitality, going beyond his duties to help us experience Istanbul in the most convenient way. Mr Fuat in the dining hall was the same, greeting us with a smile and offers of the delicious food served at Tom Tom. Tom Tom Suites is an A+ in our books! The rooms are very spacious, proper suites, and very nicely appointed. The breakfast is excellent, served with a wonderful view of the Bosporus. But the service is truly outstanding. Warm, friendly and genuine. I can’t recommend enough. We stayed at TomTom Suites for 6 nights/5 days and were thoroughly impressed with the exceptional and consistent service during our entire stay! All hotel staff went up and beyond to ensure our stay was comfortable. I really enjoyed the front desk staff (day & night) - they always took the time to ask how each day was and what we experienced in Istanbul. Extremely helpful and they provided many recommendations. Thank you! The property itself is absolutely beautiful and is remarkably quiet given its location (steps away from İstiklal Avenue. It is located on the same street as the Italian embassy - there is no vehicles aloud on this street Breakfast was delicious and they also had a very nice tea/cookie time between 4pm-6pm Prepare to do alot of walking - this is the best way to This place is amazing - simply gorgeous, and tasteful. More places should be like this. Love the concept, the restoration of an old, historical building in a very cool and interesting neighborhood. You'll hardly believe that you're just a few steps from Istiklaal Caddesi (which is a mess and crazy busy, crowded, noisy, but historically significant). The restaurant is a high end fine dining establishment. If you can't afford dinner, you will still enjoy a really special breakfast - some unique offerings and so very well crafted. In addition to Turkish kahvalti, there is also fantastic croissants. Wish we could've stayed longer and savored more of the experience. Gorgeous bathrooms! There is even a pillow menu. We stayed here for 2 nights and I can say one word for our accomadation, its amazing. Centrally located, yet it was very quiet. We were minutes away from Istiklal street, also very close to the bosphorus.  Our room and bathroom was quite spacious. (Our 3 year old loved the bathtub)  Bed, pillow menu every detail was carefully selected.  Front desk friends, were so helpful and caring.  I would stay here again and recommend it to everyone who visit Istanbul.  What an exceptional experience in Istanbul, thanks to the amazing staff at TomTom Suites.  This charming boutique hotel is beautiful and the rooms are spacious and very comfortable.    The location is perfect for touring and the roof top restaurant has a magnificent view, delicious view and wonderful warm and helpful staff.  The manager went out of his way to plan out tour of the city and arranged a private yacht tour on the Bosphorus.   Our group of 5, from Washington, DC and Paris, France loved this place.   Thank you all at TomTom Suites!!    5 STARS!!!                    \"},\n",

He was so attentive and responsive anytime I requested something. I really did enjoy my stay here. The people made it worth the experience and trip. I recommend staying here 100% as it’s an amazing hotel.  I love this hotel and stayed there 3 times before, this year was my fourth time but unfortunately, it was the worst. Service level becomes less and the stay was jot that good as always. I had a booking 1 month before and had issues with my credit card, so they sent me message with the issue but did not give me enough time to see, read and act. And got shocked to see that my reservation was canceled while I am in the airplane with 2 kids. I insisted to go there and try maybe I will find a room, but the receptionist informed me that the hotel is fully booked. I was sitting there looking for other hotels, meanwhile I received a WhatsApp message from the hotel saying that they can offer me a roof-room with the same amount of my previous reservation, it was not a good deal but I had Thanks to Cuneyt for being there throughout our stay in this amazing hotel! our new year was saved thanks to him !!  very clean and very well located hotel the staff is perfect thanks a lot for all !! Definitely NOT 5 star!! Rooms are extremely stuffy as the aircon will not work in the winter- only warm air will come out. This is controlled by the hotel. When you open your window, the smoke from the fire & shisha comes in immediately. Terrible & restless night sleep! No block out curtains either . No USB charging points- ridiculous for a 5 star hotel to not have this. Location of hotel is definitely 5 star though!  Great location. They gym was actually good, with a lot of equipment, for a hotel. Great service. Very friendly. I recommend the hotel breakfast buffet.   My maid service was really fantastic. He provided us with fresh flowers gratis.  Received a room upgrade when checking in.  The upgraded room did not have a view but it had good light, and windows that let in fresh air,  which we wouldn't have had with a basement room.    Luxury hotel for a reasonable price; good value.   Fatemah at reception was absolutely rude and horrible. She laughed in my face when I expressed an issue with a five star hotel not having a first aid kit on the premises and continued to laugh as I left the reception area. She should not be working in hospitality, she embodies quite the opposite.   All the manager could offer was directions to a pharmacy knowing they aren’t even open as it was Sunday and a guest is injured. Mohammed Sharaz and Abdullah done good job for serving food breakfast. Need more people like them.✌🏻16 December I was here and glad to meet them. And even there suggested him to take the wonderful dished  The food and service was fabulous. Mohammad Ali and Abdula were so friendly and attentive at the breakfast buffet. I would definitely recommend.   The location of this hotel is convenient to shopping, food and many attractions. We are all looking forward to a couple of days exploring this city!    One member of our group was not feeling well so we found a pharmacy nearby. The staff there was easy to speak with and gave great suggestions. Breakfast was nice. Great service by the brother Muhammad Ali who served me.  Also the sauna is excellent. Big and well maintained.  They also offer Turkish hammam and have a gym and outdoor swimming pool which is well maintained.  Wonderful trip.Very affectionate Staff.Specially at reception desk Muhammad Nadar.Gave us home like welcome.At the restaurant Muhammad  Sheraz ,Ahmar ali really looked after us .It was my birthday on 28 Nov, a surprise  cake was given to us by hotel.WOW Experience.The pool ,the fire place at the outside lawn.Evrything perfect.Thank you Sura hotels.. Amazing hotel very clean good service close to everything small issue but took care of by fateh Mohammad very professionally very impressive fatima receptionist was very helpful all the staff was amazing  Also best part was hamam and massage ❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏 thank u so much This is a fantastic hotel if you want to be in the heart of Istanbul. All the action is literally here - great restaurants, shopping, the tram line, the Blue Mosque and the Spice Markets. Literally within 2 seconds and a 15 minute walk max. A huge benefit of staying at Sura Hagia is there is no need to use taxi. For those that know Istanbul you know how hit and miss they are.  It’s not just the location that is great. The staff ar all very helpful. Room service was fast and impeccable. Mr Ulec and his team on concierge are also incredibly helpful and can pretty much organise or help with anything you ask.   The Spa is great including free use of the Sauna, Steam and Hammam. The barbers/hairdresser and massages are all exceptional and fairly priced.  This is an exceptionally good muhammad ali at the buffet was really helpful and kind, excellent food and service   Our stay at the hotel was amazing   Room was great with good views, clean and comfortable   300 meters from mesquite  The staff here is really disappointing. Especially the person named Fatiya at the counter, she was incredibly rude to my little one. We had just come off a long flight and my child was quite upset. Fatiya  shouted at her to be quiet, which was really hurtful. I would definitely not recommend staying here if you want to enjoy your time in Istanbul. We had also made a reservation that stated check-in was at 12 am. Instead of providing an explanation, the staff member simply said that 12 pm is considered the afternoon, which clearly shows their lack of education. It's just really disheartening. I traveled with my mom and we stayed at this hotel for a few nights. Great location, lots of restaurants and shops around with the walking distance. Hotel was nice and clean. We loved the little garden area. We came from the United States and had a jet leg so we would go to the garden in the middle of night to get coffee. We met Daniar who was working a night shift there. He was very nice, friendly and good manners. He made really good coffee and made us feel like home. Terrible hotel!!  They charge too much for the service you get.  We were charged 210 euros per night for a small room with the smallest beds I've ever seen in any hotel.  The hassle I went through during the reservations!  I booked through booking.com and the hotel started texting me on WhatsApp before my arrival.  They kept claiming that my card is declining, I gave them four different credit cards and om each card they keep changing the currency!  For example if it's a visa or Mastercard they charge in euros if it's American Express they charge in Turkish lira.  I was in Spain before arriving in Istanbul and I was getting contacted by my credit cards since the hotel kept taking authorizations and my credit cards suspected it was a fraud transactions because of the amount of The hotel and staff were lovely. Emily in particular was a kind-hearted, caring and fun individual I came across and helped make our experience so worthwhile. The location feels safe and is very close to the trams, so travelling around Istanbul is made easy and accessable. Thankyou for having us :)  What a fantastic hotel in a perfect location of central Istanbul. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel for 3 nights. The hotel, rooms and bathrooms were clean throughout, as well as the pool and outdoor spaces. Our room was cleaned and made up every single day. The staff were friendly and helpful most of the time (sometimes language barrier could be an issue but there was always someone else on hand to understand and help).   I loved the fragrance of the hotel as you entered every single time, the fragrance in the corridors and inside the rooms. Shame they wouldn’t share any product information to purchase the fragrances. Top secret apparently.   The hotel is walking distance from most of the main attractions as well as shops and so many cafes and restaurants to choose Rude employees, extremely unaccommodating and some of the worst/most unprofessional service I’ve ever had the displeasure of booking with. Trust me you’ll be doing yourself a favor if you go somewhere else. We were booked at the Sura through a group tour and I had read really varied accounts before we left. We stayed twice at the beginning and end of the tour. The first room was lovely on the 5th floor with a small window with a view of roof tops. Very clean and comfortable. On the return for one night we had a basement room which was also very clean and comfortable, weird mirror wall and door [disco era feel] but kind of interesting. It had patio with table and chairs which was nice and made the room seem bigger. The breakfast was huge and had enough choices to satisfy even the pickiest eater. The best part is the location. My partner and I were able to walk to the Archaeological Museum and the Topkapi Palace easily from the hotel which is in the heart of the Sultanahmet district. Had a great stay again, Great Location, lovely room , close to tram station and loads of restaurants and bars around make this hotel worth all your money  Can’t forget the great breakfast offered, service at the restaurant has always been great They have a great team at the restaurant who made all not so possible.... Possible  I have to thank Zakaria and Rahim at the restaurant to had made  a difference with their excelling service  Would certainly visit again  Thanks 😊  Well located and a fairly easy walk to Mosques, Palace, Grand Bazar, Park, Bosphorus, etc.  Stayed on initial arrival to Turkey and before departure.  Plenty of dining options around the area.  Busy neighborhood but quiets down at night, however you will hear the prayer from the mosque early in the morning if you are a light sleeper.  Breakfast buffet was great and a good way to start the day.  Did not get a chance to experience any of the amenities but looked pretty good. I dont usually write reviews so im going to break down from why i knocked off each star and you can be the judge of it. First time in europe and had little to no expectations but ive been everywhere else. Starting at 5 stars -1 star, asking for extra hand soap once, they said ok, never came asking for extra hand soap, they bring soup asking for extra hand soap they just hang up on me -1 star Like the other reviews have said, AC shuts off randomly so I would be breaking into sweats 3-4 times a night getting up to turn back on the AC -1 star theres black mold in washroom and said theyll send us down someone to change rooms, but never did -0.5 star We assumed breakfast was included because we asked and receptionist says it starts at 7, they also let us in by us telling them the My travel agent booked this hotel. We got good rooms. Rooms are clean and well equipped. Staff is very smiling and very helping. Breakfast  is good but not great. Room size is kind of small. And, bathroom shower has slippery floor. For older people like us there is nothing to hold. They need to change shower floor and fix safety bars to hold.                    \"},\n",

The dinners were lovely the alcoholic drinks expensive, would be nice to have a bigger menu with more vegetarian options. Breakfast lovely but a different variety would be nice each day  Overall a good stay  Thank you The room was so neat. The bath towels was changed daily. After coming back into the room after a long hectic day, I feel like coming back to my home, I don't feel like going bak and this was only possible by the housekeeping staff safiye... Each time we call for help, she was always at our service... Thanks a lot safiye.. We will miss yoy Good morning, we spent a week and we had a very good time with all the services. We would like to make a special mention for Mrs. Serife who cleaned the room, very good and kind as well as very professional, Luciano and Claudia felice 2024 a tutti Amazing hotel for families , spacious rooms , very professional and smiling reception and room service team. Ee loved the attention and how nice they were with us, they even gave us extra water  Berna and her team at the breakfast were amazing and so nice with the kids.  Very friendly staff, the reception staff was very helpful.Safiye did an amazing job ! The location is the best , just outside the tram station. Breakfast needs to improve and certainly the pasta , which was served in tamato sauce! Was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the rooms. Thank you to our housekeeper Ms. Safiye for being so sweet! Plus, there were many beverages, snacks and fruits that were on the house. Overall good experience! I am Sunni from Libya. I really liked this hotel. It is comfortable, elegant, and very clean. The food is very good. There is an employee named Bulent . He is a very sophisticated and respectful person This hotel is a great hotel to visit great services and great employees the place is so clean I didn't have any problems when I stayed in it and I want to recommend a two good employees SUAT and TALHA thank you for the good service hope to come again soon Good located near the Findikzade stop on the T1, which takes you to all the important spots in Istanbul. The room was big, clean and well designed. There was a bad smell coming from the sink drain, which the hotel should address. The housekeeping lady on our floor (4th) was super nice, very cheerful and friendly. The breakfast buffet was good but the menu didn't change daily. The staff there were very attentive. Front Desk guys were efficient. We did note, though, that a lot of the staff seemed keen on getting mentioned on our review. One girl brought us tea at breakfast (she was assigned at the bar) and point-blank asked us to give her a good review on TripAdvisor. Hope this trend does not become unmanageable in the future. Otherwise, really good hotel!                                                            \"},\n",

Parking is available at a close and reasonable place, overall very nice experience would recommend to anyone! Great location lots of food shops, restaurants and bars  and Taksim Square. Accommodation was clean and had everything you need including air con. We loved the decor and would definitely recommend this quirky apartment to our friends. Area felt safe and was really busy.  Appartments have everything you need, cozy and clean. This place is like my second home in Istanbul. The place is located in a charming area and lots of nice restaurants, cafes and bar within walking distance. Will come back and really recommend My Suite Istanbul. The apartment was clean, quiet and good equipped. The 2 balconys allowed a fantastic view. And the hotel manager Enes was very kind and helpful. In the area around you will find many little shops, modern cafés and restaurants with young local people. You even can find vegetarian und vegan food on the menue. And the touristic highlights are not far away. The perfect location for a perfect stay in Istanbul. We stayed at the studio apartment with sea view and terrace and absolutely loved it.  Quirky, clean, and comfortable with fantastic views from the really cool terrace, we very much recommend.  Close to amenities, tram stop, and fabulous places to eat and just soak up the Istanbul vibe.  Amazing :) :) There was so much about this little hotel that was great - the host Enis was so helpful and easy to contact before I arrived, he gave great tips for my stay in Istanbul & even had a transport card I could use. The room was lovely, small but so comfortable & everything I needed. It was clean & the bed comfy. I loved the location also - some great vibes & seemed like lots of locals but not too far from the tourist spots. Some great cafes & bars & restaurants in the area. Highly recommend. Absolutely absolutely wonderful service and the hotel manager was perfect service. a big recommendation for everyone you will like the room too but the hotel manager is perfect for his job.Thank You service a lot. I will definitely be in the same hotel  next Time  The location of the hotel is very close to the center 🔝🔝 And very clean and safe place,  We love everything about our stay ❤❤❤ Enes is very friendly,available and helpful  💐❤❤ It was very good experience👍👍👍 We loved absolutely everything about our stay. It was clean and well equiped, with perfect location. Our host was available about every question we had, explained us everything about the city, gave us a map and transportation card as well as recomended some local restaurants. Very nice apartment with the wonderful view on the major attractions: Blue Moskue, Aya Sofia and others. Two terraces, good kitchen and bedrooms.  The design is authentic!  The owner is very careful and nice! I have been there for a week at november and liked it very much. There are lot of beautiful historical buildings, shops, museums nearby. Wonderful neighborhood, super friendly and helpful owner. Totally recommend 10/10 👍 Enes is a great host. He helped us a lot, even it was not his duty. We felt save with a small child. Around the building there is literally all you need while travelling. We will definitely return to the apartment. It is a good base to explore this amazing town. The Best apartment in the Herat of Taksim many of cafes and restaurants around of the hotel 5 minutes walking to Taksim square u will find all support and help from the staff the furnitures of room is new for sure I will repeat the experience in this hotel again The location and the host are great! It is a safe neighborhood, you can find anything you need in walking distance. The place is an excellent choice for couples and short visits. Rooms, linens and towels were very clean. I strongly suggest this cute property! Staying at Mysuite Istanbul I didn't feel like a tourist, but it's rather like staying at a friend's flat. The room is clean and nicely decorated. It's a short walk distance from the main pedestrian street and Taxim square. The host Enes is very friendly and helpful - he greeted us personally and gave tips on noteworthy places and excursions. Just next door on the same street is a nice vegan cafe. Excellent value. Clean comfortable well equipped place in the heart of Cihangir, one of the best areas to stay in Istanbul. Very quiet, amazing views from the 2 terraces. Large sleeping rooms, comfortable beds.   Will definitely go back. I have traveled to Istanbul many times always staying in a boutique hotel. This time I decided to try something different and get a suite or a apartment. After searching a bit I found my suite Istanbul and from the reviews I decided to give it a try. Stayed August 1st to August 7th . I am very pleased and can say that all the positive reviews are accurate. The Apartment I stayed in is in a great location with everything one may need very nearby ( and a lovely delicious vegan restaurant 2 doors down) while close to everything still not noisy!! It was well equipped with everything I needed and a wonderful rainfall shower. As nice as everything was perhaps what made the stay truly wonderful was the manager Enes. He is extremely polite very friendly and the response time to messages The apartment with terrace we stayed in was wonderful in every way: the interior, the location, and most importantly the terrace. Also, Enes, the host, was very helpful and very nice. I think I could confidently recommend MySuit Istanbul to anyone. We spent almost 2 weeks in the apartment with friends. That was really nice. Beautiful apartment and amazing views. Enes is an excellent and helpful host. He advised some tasty restaurants nearby and how to spend leisure time in Intanbul. Also Enes helped us in solving some problems. We are very grateful to him. I am ready to advertise My Suite to my friends and I hope to visit Istanbul again.  From Russia with love,  Maria :) The apartments have everything you need for comfortable living, 2 terraces and walking distance to the delicious restaurants of the area.  When they met, Enes showed a map and marked the most interesting places in Istanbul on it. He also helped with travel tips and advice throughout the entire time. He even organized a trip to the hamam :)\"},\n",

I would definitely recommend her, the whole experience was relaxing.  The hamam itself was nice watching all the dirt being scrubbed away. This hotel has a very nice and polite staff, and the interior is quite beautifully decorated. I stayed here with my girlfriend on our trip to Istanbul this summer. The location is great, too, and from the outside, the place looks like one of those historical Italian palaces.  We are so happy.  The  breakfast is so delicious Everything is so nice. The hotel location is so good and the stuff and the person it’s nice thank you for everything  we thinking for coming back the next time  The staff provided outstanding service throughout, diligently working to match the establishment's elegant atmosphere. Its prime location is ideal for major attractions, conveniently situated near subway and tram stations for easy access to key sites. The Grand Bazaar is also within walking distance. While the breakfast and dinner offerings are modest and not particularly extravagant, they are satisfactory if you're not looking for a lavish dining experience. The staff are exceptionally hospitable, going above and beyond to assist and support their guests One of the worst hotel you need. 1 - Loud music till 2am, I called reception multiple times and they don't care as the got your money. I suffered 7 nights with the same issues. 2 - They don't change the bed sheets, I asked multiple times and the manager said we changed it. I told him when I left my room this morning I put a cross on the corner of bedsheet with a pen, it's a same bed sheet. 3 - Dirtiest carpets, bathroom used towel were folded and put them back, I have to tell them that these are wet towels I left this morning. 4 - All of these comments above are 100% written with all the honesty. Please please don't waste your money. I left these comments to booking.com and they refused to post them since their commission is at risk and don't care about their customers.   Where to start.  Day 1 arrived. Pre booked room not ready. Sent to a random hotel in the middle of the night at own expense.  Day 2 - Checked in Room that was promised was given to someone else. Left with inferior room with non functioning items. There were electrical wires hanging out the walls.  Room was dirty Staff bunch of thieves that don't know what they are doing.  Management useless. One day we had no water in the hotel and Management blamed local outage even though I have video footage of them filling up the roof top pool.  Do your self a favour and give this hotel a miss. Check national UK newspapers as they have had a story printed about the treatment of UK guests.  They give the people of Turkey a bad name. The hotel it self is good but never is 5 star however there are afew lady’s who’s dealing with the attraction places however they are all rip off and charges you a lot and all lies  From what I saw even the guests were not happy about this . It gives the hotel a bad reputation  For this reason I left 2 star otherwise the hotel is good for the money they charges but never is 5 star as no indoor pool was open no sauna no steaming room only outdoor pool The Worst Hotel we have ever booked. We stayed for 14 days and I wish I could cancel my booking and get a refund! Everything about This hotel mentioned here is a lie. From day 1 we were moved into a small tiny studio apartment with an excuse that they were over booked.   Bathroom doors were broken. Balcony doors are broken. The entire hotel I so old that you keep hearing every single noise. Early morning we were woken up by banging noise from the construction that was going on.   Entire afternoon the water was cut off and the hotel had no idea about it. They kept saying they’re working on it.   The breakfast is a disaster. Everyday they kept removing one or two items from their menu. We just skipped our breakfast and ate from outside.   The room service is so bad they don’t even Wyndham Hotel Istanbul Old City is renowned for its exceptional amenities and outstanding service, making it an unforgettable destination for your stay in Istanbul. One remarkable highlight of this hotel is its amazing buffet, offering a wide array of delicious dishes to satisfy your tastes and cravings. Whether you prefer local cuisines or international delicacies, you will find an array of options to indulge in.  Additionally, the hotel staff at Wyndham Hotel Istanbul Old City, particularly HOUDA, ensure that every guest feels welcome and well taken care of throughout their stay. HOUDA is known for her exceptional friendliness and helpful nature, offering a warm and personalized experience to all guests.  During your stay, you had the opportunity to experience all these The bad points out-weigh the good I’m afraid.  The hotel is situated within walking distance of all main attractions. Most of the staff are courteous and helpful but there’s a lack of any managerial presence in the hotel.  However, the decor is slightly gaudy and tacky – the chandelier, for example, looks like it came out of a Christmas cracker. And if you like “5 star” hotels that serve chips and onion rings for breakfast then this is the place for you. There will also be a clown walking around to entertain you if you are 7yrs old. There is a pool which desperately needs some maintenance and attention. I noticed live electricity wires exposed out of light switches, for example.  Our room was small (to the point the bed was pushed up against a wall!). We had to ask for coat What we like: 1. They offer refreshing drink at the entrance for free.  2. Reception & dining staff very accommodating. 3. Their bed is very comfortable.  4. Their lobby is magnificent and good for selfies.  5. The haman bath is amazing.   6. Mr. Murat’s service at the dining hall is excellent. Courteous and anticipates your needs.   What we don’t like. 1. Room service appalling. We struggled with language barrier to explain that we need the room cleaned and why we need shower gel. It’s a 5 star hotel but some light bulbs don’t work. We called their attention but nothing happened. Perhaps they’re saving electricity. For days they left their hamper and cleaning trolley at the hallway leading to our room giving us the impression that our area is their utility room as well. This is First of all ... this is absolutely NOT a 5-star hotel as it claims to be. It is 3-stars, at best, and even then that is being generous.   Our room (1004) had non-functioning lights, requests for shower gel were ignored (we ended up buying our own), the smoke detector had been dismantled, the safe is not fixed in any way, and can just be carried out of the room if so desired, and the floor of the room seemed to always be coated in a grey dust, making us wonder if it was ever cleaned properly.   The Concierge service cannot be trusted. If you ask them to arrange a taxi for you, the taxi driver will not turn on the meter, and the fare will be double the cost of what it should be. If you ask about a laundry service, you will be told that it is possible but slow, only for the The hotel charged my credit card in full in advance of arriving which is not the terms when I booked, I cancelled the room as this does not fill me with confidence they are a trustworthy establishment. Still waiting for my refund I would not trust this hotel at all, T o get a status update on your refund they ask you to send a message to a WhatsApp number really!! Great value for money, close to all tourist locations and lots of food options available nearby. If you want to experience Istanbul as a culture and city then Fatih district is the place to be. This hotel is also very close to the metro, 1 min walk away. 10 mins walk to grand bazaar and 15 mins walk to Haigha Sophia and blue mosque. Taksim square and Galata tower are 20 mins in a yellow cab costing around £15. Great value for money. The only thing I would say is the rooms are very small compared to other hotels and are also a little dated. I hope the investment is made in this regard as everything else is great including the staff who are really helpful. Muhammad and Hiba from guest relations. The only thing 5 star is the sign at the front, unfortunately that's it! The staff are good however be mindful when asking for taxi’s, they’ll try and fool you with fixed prices - 300% cheaper if you pick one direct. Taxis are required to have meter running if not, passengers do not need to pay!  Back to the hotel - needs a complete configuration- the rooms very small in fact the habitable space is not as described (and this was an upgrade). There are better rooms in the 4stars nearby. The communal space - a film set of a Roman party! Not for me nor will I recommend. I stayed at the Wyndham Old City Hotel in Istanbul and have some feedback to share:  1. Noise from the restaurant on the 1st floor was quite disruptive, causing discomfort until late at night (1-2am).  2. The breakfast buffet had many options, but the food lacked flavor and quality. Most items were overcooked or tasteless.  3. Dinner was a disappointment with dry, overcooked meat, cold pasta, limited choices, and overpriced drinks. The white wine was warm, and the red wine wasn't tasty.  4. Cleaning services were subpar, with bedsheets not being changed during a 4-night stay. They mainly took out the trash and remade the bed.  5. The staff was friendly but not very helpful. We changed rooms due to noise and other issues but faced the same problems each time, which is Not a 5 star as it says . Not very organised booked the room for 8 nights and the second night they turned up at the door thinking the room was empty ,and knocking on the door literally every hour, very strange a 5 star hotel should have a work plan though  They only thing good about this hotel was the guy named (Murat) down at the restaurant  Wouldn't go back  We went to this hotel in July 2023. Coming Istanbul for the 1st time, we were not sure what to expect. Walked into the hotel and met the concierge staff member, Abdul Rahman Elkady. Really friendly individual with a smile on his face. Told us everyday which places to visit and always had a smile on his face. The hotel room was nice and the service was excellent. Would recommend anyone going to Istanbul to stay at this hotel. Alot of Shops and food locations around near to the hotel and only a 10 minute walk to the shopping areas. Anyone who stays at the hotel, ask for Abdul Rahman and i promise, you will have a pleasent stay. Great breakfast options and hotel located near metro. Unfortunately the water had a bad smell and taste. Also our room had no outside windows which was a bit strange. For a 5 star hotel i was not expecting this. Hı all servise was perfect i really enjoyed mu stay and i will back aoon thank you for the best turkish  food that I ever had and also the out door pool was amazing cool the room was so comfortable and good ac  Awful, terrible, distgusting, despicable. Avoid at all costs Nothing was working, hotel is a hostel, not a 5 star hotel. The food even the stray dogs and cats outside wouldnt touch Dirty rooms, dirty bath tubs, walls made of cardboard, dust everywhere Family of 2 adults and 3 children. We were allocated an underground room, which at first seemed strange, but had an enormous jacuzzi in the room. I cannot emphasize enough how helpful all the staff were.  In particular the extremely helpful and informative bell captain and the breakfast leader - Sultana. The breakfast buffet is very varied, something for everyone, and always attentive staff for seating and other requests. The hotel will soon be under the Wyndham group management.   The roof pool is a reasonable size, the spa pool is even bigger.  We tried the spa and sauna package. The kids particularly enjoyed the bubble package.  Only one negative comment and that would be the long wait to complete check-in.  Even that was alleviated by looking at things to do guided by the It was fun because there were  a lot of restaurants and shops close to the area and the people were really kind. There were a lot of food for breakfast and it tasted nice  and the swimming pools were fun to swim in! It was pleasure to stay in this hotel for 2 nights, hope next time we stay again with this hotel but with cheaper price 😉😋. The location was very helpfull it was close to the metro station and bazar as well The services are al together nice I've enjoyed here . Definitely  I'll book my next trip in this hotel the staff and food made my trip so amazing and cheerful 😊.  I recommend every one to book your trip in celal agha hotel  The hotels location is really good and close to metro station. we used spa and hamam is was clean and relaxing. The quality of food was also good and the outdoor pool  was very clean and good in summer. Very helpful very clean and supplied lovely place we so happy, good food nice swimming pool very clean hygiene and very polite stuff very lovely location so close to Central and amenities all around thank you Best hotel ever, Kady and maya were simply amazing. I have always been treated with respect and with exclusive treatment. The food was good, even tho dinner a bit better than breakfast. The hotel provides many services.  I would not call them 5* hotel, rather 4 or 3.5 star. Breakfast was good, but for sure it can be improved.  Next to metro station is a plus. Majority of Istanbul attractions are within walking distance. Pools are nice, but water in the  indoor pool was extremely cold.   - wifi is poor, keep complaining and still no one bother to fix. - We request baby cot, and it was never delivered despite multiple reminders. - everyone transfers the request to next person.                    \"},\n",

The staff are super friendly and helpful and the Hostel has a good atmosphere with social events most nights, very easy to meet people. Thanks for having me! Room and balcony were dirty.  Shower broken.  Bathroom stank.  Staff a bit clueless.  Rates exorbitant.  Came away feeling fleeced and mis-sold the experience.  More shabby than shabby-chic. Nice view and good location. The staff at the hotel were attentive and polite, it was in compliance with the rules, this hotel was very clean, thank you for all the services, I will come here again, the food was great, we liked it very much. It was a really great time. The hostel has the perfect location if you want to explore the city. Every evening there is a program (Pup Crawl, Free Shisha evening, drinking games). There is a good bar with cheap drinks. The breakfast is also very good. Murat and Max, the hosts are very cool. I stayed for 4 days at this hostel. Staff is co-operative but at the same time lacks professional approach. Events dont happen as planned day wise. No whatsap group for all travelers to be connected or stay in synch with any activities. 20€ each for pubcrawls everyday is little too much, specially when there is no plan and idea of which clubs you will get to see. You are forced to go clubs they have deals with and you cannot enjoy real good party places as you are bound with them. Dont take any trips from the reception as they will sell out in double the price. I was forced to pay 70€ for aweful cruise which was available for just 30€ on website. And they didnt allow me to cancel and pushed me to go for it since I enquired and wasnt allowed to cancel later. So check for the The hostel is in a perfect location to see the historic sites of Istanbul. I’ve stayed in hundred of hostels in many parts of the world and the friendliness of this place is second to none, it may not be 5 star but the rooms have great aircon, the beds are comfy and the bar is well stocked. The guys that work and own this place are very lovely . Sometimes you want to relax on your own even in a hostel atmosphere but after spending a week here I feel like I’m part of the cheers family. Everyone remembers your name , it’s a hostel so you may not get 5 star facilities but you will get 5 star service. You can organise all trips from here and the location is better than most in Istanbul for for what you want. Overall , I’d give it a 10/10 for the experience I’ve had in this place . The hostel is in the old town right by all the main sites to see. Everyday it comes with a great free breakfast (eggs, beef, cheese, veggies, fruit, french toast). Jay is the bar tender and event coordinator and he makes sure that as a solo traveler you get to meet everyone. Good staff, especially Max who is very welcoming and friendly. bar view is with marmara sea is wonderful. we stayed very tidy  room. thanks for everything location so close is everywhere #maxisthebest Max is the best host I’ve met. Definitely will come back here in Istanbul.bar view amazing. You can play chess dart and beer pong. If I would come Istanbul again I will choose this hostel again .#maxstillisthebest I went to many hostels around the globe, but this one is really special, they make you welcome from the first minutes you get there, the activities are great, Belly dance, BBQ, KARAOKE, GAMES, y can't be bored in that place that have a particular positive energy, the staff is there and love deeply their job which is making the big difference! Just go there when you go to Istanbul it's really fantastic and the hostel is nearby the best touristic places of Istanbul!                      Really enjoyed my stay, lovely place, nice and clean and service was great. Jay the bartender was amazing, really enjoyed the activities he put on, the beer pong was the best, and the karaoke was a good laugh. Overall a great stay, thanks again Jay, will deffo be back! :) This being my second trip it was awesome as usual. The staff here we're extremely helpful, friendly and polite...great place to meet new people from different corners of the world. Rooms are clean, has a bar and a balcony with fantastic views of the sea along with free breakfast. Walking distance from main attractions. Definitely value for money. Overall great visit ...will definitely be back again. Special thanks to Sial, Murat & Jay  for looking after me. Tomay (  The owner ) hats off for maintaining the hospitality standards.   Located a stone's throw from the major tourist sites, this place is a chill oasis on a quiet side street.  You can walk to Hagia Sophia, the Galata bridge and so many other places you want to visit in 5 to 20 minutes. For $50 bucks my private room was clean and well-priced but nothing too amaze.  It's the staff that make the lighthouse shine.  Like a cast of characters from an international sit-com, you have Jay, the Brit expat bartender, who can rock a crowd of visitors late into the evening or chill with three patrons drinking beer and talking about movies depending on the evening's direction.  He was a perfect companion my first tired night in town and the reason my one-night stay turned into three. You have Moran the manager who can give you travel advice in at least 5 The staff at the hostel were all amazing! Extremely welcoming and take great care of the hostel! Jay took us out for an unforgettably night on the town. I highly recommend the hostel and taking part in their events! Only good thing was location. Almost everything could have been much better. I didn’t get a room in the hostel building, but in an annex across the street, about 20m away. My stay this way seem like an airbnb, but with no living room, no kitchen, and very small room and bathroom. Worse than that, very poor conditions overall (photos attached). The ceiling lamp was not enough to keep the room to acceptable brightness levels, and 2 bed lamps on each side were not working. very uncomfortable toilet, especially if I needed to use it right after using the shower. Another annoying thing was the excessive number of humidity flies in the room, every night/morning I had to kill several, and the room had at times very nasty smell so I had to open the window. Incredibly, my room was not Found this amazing place on TripAdvisor after reading excellent reviews on TripAdvisor I decided to stay there. I booked for two night in 8 beds sharing room. Got good price on booking.com. The rooms was very clean, Hot shower with soap and shampoo, the breakfast was very delicious which was included in the price. Most good thing is this hostel is nearest to Blu mosque, Santa Sofia and Metro. You can excess whole Istanbul Easily. The staff was amazing the one was from UK and two other was from Pakistan al of them was very polite informative, helpful and make funs to keep happy and enjoy your evening. They have some amazing activities like free huka ( Shisha ) belly dance and etc.  overall I enjoyed my both evenings with them and already planes my second visit to Cheers Well let me start from the checkinn the staff is so friendly they make me feel so comfortable felt me like a family im so satisfied with them i think thats my best hostel the view is incredible the breakfast is rich sinan your amazing my men you have very positive energy they have daily events which is lovely thankyou soo much cheers team will definietly come back This is the best place if you are thinking to go to istambul! The location is great, with a really good price relation.  The place is so beautiful and clean, but the best I can praise is the atmosphere. Is the best place to go if you are a solo traveler to meet other travelers. Jay, Sinan and Murat were great, they even let me to keep my bag without check in. So nice to meet this kind people. I recently visited this Bar and all I can say is I absolutely enjoyed every aspect. The Atmosphere, service, drinks and the overall vibe was enjoyable. Also the owner was nice and very inviting. I definitely recommend coming here if you’re in Turkey. Had a great time at Cheers Lighthouse, it’s a great place for solo travellers as you get to meet so many new people. Jay in particular was very welcoming and made me feel at home. Would highly recommend!!                    \"},\n",

We stayed in the “Purple” Suite which had a view from the 6th floor and a super rain shower. After many years of traveling, a good shower is appreciated! Hospitality was exceptional. Breakfast Buffet had everything one could possibly want including order anything special. We loved this hotel. Service is fantastic. Decor is beautiful. Very comfortable. Friendly and helpful staff. Highly recommended. Well located. Excellent food! The breakfast is out of this world. Hard to beat their cuisine. Thank you Husein and everyone! This hotel was absolutely wonderful. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable and the staff are so friendly and helpful definitely get breakfast included - a brilliant Turkish and continental breakfast to start the day is the way to go (Hussain our waiter was great!) Centrally located to all the best attractions too. Can’t recommend enough! It was one of our favourite hotels. All the staff are very helpful and friendly. It was very clean and our stay was comfortable and relaxing. The spa Hammam and massage was one of the best I’ve ever had!  My children would love to extend a special thank you and mention to Taner for being so friendly and making sure they are always happy. Love and Duas from Abdullah Aaminah Aasiyah.  We hope you will always remember us as we will hold our trip to Istanbul and Ajwa hotel in a very special place in our hearts.  We cannot wait to return once again soon.  Thanks again to the amazing staff and beautiful hotel. Highly recommend to couples and families.  Excellent hotel with great service.  Niyazi at reception was particularly helpful. The hotel is located in prime location with all tourist areas nearby.  The hotel is small but is definitely a 5 star hotel and experience. The spa is secluded and of very high quality.  We will definitely be returning. This hotel is extremely nice and has great attention to detail.  The location is perfect as all tourist attractions are within 10 minutes walk. Bear in mind you need to walk up a steep hill as you do in many areas of Istanbul but staff can arrange a complimentary shuttle bus to assist with this which I highly recommend if you have children.  Asimya in the spa is particularly helpful and all the staff provide excellent service. I will definitely be returning to Ajwa! Thank you Ajwa for your hospitality! My partner and I felt very well looked after. We had friendly greetings from all staff and especially appreciated the hands on concierge.   Few staff to mention would be Hasan, Hussein Taos, Mari and Aytac. 10/10, have already recommended to friends. Thank you <3  Please see pics of hotel and azerbaijani restaurant attached  I came here on my own after a tour of Turkey for some rest and relaxation before flying out and it was amazing. I was well looked after by all the staff, from breakfast to dinner, the lobby and the absolute best spa treatment that I have ever had. First experience of a Hammam and will not be my last, wish I could have another one. The tours that were organized for me where they picked me up and dropped me off, all curated by the beautiful Kubra with care and personalized touch. She is the Guest relations manager of the hotel.  Big call out Tamer at breakfast, thank you, and to everyone else I may have missed. We are really happy for choosing this nice comfy hotel and its super professional staff. They were so helpful, welcoming and made us feel so much taken care of. Interior is very artistic. The breakfast buffet menu is enormous, and every single item is mouthwatering 😋 Staff at the restaurant - very very professional 👍👍 Erhan welcomed us so warmly on our first day. Nurgul made sure our room be clean and comfy daily. Thank you so much everyone. Another pro, It's also located in walkable distance from Blue Mosque, Ayasofia church, museums, Grand Bazaar and few other iconic tourist attractions. Overall, our family will choose only this place to stay if we ever visit Istanbul again. Thank you Ajwa team 🙏 I would like to write about my experience in Ajwa hotel first of all its stunning and beautiful more then that I received a very worm and respectful host from Kubra and Mari I’m sending you kiss and thank you so much see you next time❤️ I stayed here in August 2023.  The hotel was smaller than I expected but this just meant the service could be that much more personal and it was. Virtually every member of staff made me and my family feel welcome and they really made our stay in Istanbul enjoyable and special.  The hotel is relatively new (< 10 years)  and has been maintained well. The decor is very traditional and is walking distance from the main mosques in the area.  The reasons I have rated the hotel 4 stars instead of 5 are:  1. My wife and I could not go to the pool together as there are separate slots for men and women  2. There was only one restaurant and the food (aside from breakfast) was not great  3. The hotel was dry (no alcohol) The staff at reception especially Marie were most welcoming and helpful always ready to assist. Room service was amazing, after returning from a long day it was always nice to return to a lovely clean room. We stayed in the French street view double room. The room was nice and spacious the bed and pillows were very comfortable however the room was a little dark even during the day. If you're looking for a bright airy room maybe book the sea view. The staff in Zafaran restaurant were very courteous always ready with a smile especially Hussein and Taner. I would highly recommend staying at this beautiful hotel. The family room we had had a very small window to the wall and some plants. No natural light, so you don’t even notice that it is morning. This is not a 5 star hotel accommodation. Shower had issue with hot/ cold water, temperature was changing, was hard to take a shower. The room felt like a cave. We stayed at Ajwa hotel in Istanbul for 9 nights. The staff were so helpful specially Kubra who was amazing. She was always there to help and assist you with your needs. Thank you so much for an amazing experience. Beautiful hotel in perfect location in the middle of Istanbul.  Staff very friendly and helpful, especially the concierge who booked lots of trips and transfers for us.  We are a family of 6 and stayed in a small 3 bedroom house owned by the hotel which was a short walk away and which gave us space and independence, with kitchen, roof terrace and sauna in the house, but with full access to the hotel for meals and spa facilities.  The breakfast was superb. Spa with pool was friendly and good treatments. Nice hotel. We’ll stuff and we enjoy the stay very much. Especially Ms.Kubra was so help and lovely. She took the birthday cake up to restaurant for my daughter birthday. Also the stuff at the restaurant was were good. The cleanness in the room were perfect! Thank you to AJWA Hotel !!!! The decor is lovely, the room spacious, the bathroom very nice, but mediocre cuisine. The staff was nice and helpful. The neighborhood not so nice, I would never stay there again. Very expensive for what it offers. We would highly recommend this luxury family friendly hotel.   We stayed here last week of July 2023  and we had an amazing time. We are a Muslim family of 4 with teenage children’s booked 2 rooms for 4 days. When we arrived at the hotel we had welcome drinks and snack which was really nice whilst our suitcases was taken to our rooms.   Décor of the hotel looked amazing and rooms looked so beautiful.   Booking Communication  Communication from the hotel was clear and always replied quickly when we had questions.      Tour  The hotel location was central to all the tourist locations and we didn’t need to book taxi for our tour. We booked a private Istanbul Tour & guide with hotel. This included fast track service and we done everything at own pace so we enjoyed every monument Extremely expensive and not that great! They try their best but it’s not great honestly. Rooms are smaller than you expect. Service is average. Location is ordinary. It’s in the old town so the historical sites are very close. The restaurant is non alcoholic. No bar.   The interiors are amazing. Good architecture and artwork. This is a beautifully appointed boutique hotel in the heart of the Sultanahmet historic district.  It is one of the premier hotels I have ever had the pleasure of staying in.  The staff is pleasant, professional and very accommodating.  The rooftop restaurant has not only fantastic views, but also an excellent buffet and menu of breakfast foods.  Don’t miss getting dinner reservations!  My husband and I had a delicious and authentic Turkish meal of tender lamb shank and scrumptious meatballs in sour cherry sauce.  We highly recommend a stay at the Ajwa Sultanahmet!  Check them out online.  They offer too many services to list here.\"},\n",

This place is a gem, you will get the value for your money and the fact that the booking here is budget friendly is mind blowing.

The breakfust was good and the location also was good thank you skalion hotel This is a very nice hotel. We stayed in an economy room, which was basic as I have stayed in better. But every single  staff member I came in contact  with  was wonderful.  I stayed with  my sister and she always finds something  to complain  about, but apart for a few niggles such as the the heating in the room which was sorted  out for us promptly   she had a great time.  Their  breakfast is the other reason I will come back to this hotel. It was so so good! There was so much choice and very filling. Thank you to all the staff who looked after us. I didn't  take note of the names, but evr was so kind and helpful. I  will definitely  be back, and next time, I will come with  the rest of my sisters. I will  upgrade to  a better room though! 😌                                         It was a wonderful stay special with the staff they help us a lot and they give us a good advices special Mariem she helped us a lot the view from the restaurant was amazing and the location was close to everything  The breakfast was delicious and healthy the staff of the hotel was so helpful and friendly the rooms was good and the view from the top floor was so nice specially in the morning the location also was good  Had the pleasure of staying at the Skalion hotel and spa, the staff were very welcoming and made us feel very comfortable. As we entered to check in we were greeted by happy staff. We were offered excursions and directed us to the Grand Bazaar.   Mariem was very helpful, telling us of the facilities available in the hotel. We had asked if we could go and look at the restaurant as well as the spa and they were happy to show us around.  Overall the service was great, any queries we had the staff had signposted to the right direction.  The night atmosphere around the area was busy and the shops were open till late It was my first time in istanbul and it was amazing the stuff was so helpful and unique specially mariem the breakfast was varied and delicious the view also from the top floor was great the room also was good and location of the hotel was very close to the most popular places in Istanbul  Was an amazing experience with a kindful staff and the view were absolutely beautiful, the room were comfortable and the service were great and really useful , whenever I visit Istanbul again i know where to stay  This 4-star hotel is within walking distance of the Grand Bazaar (although it's a bit of a climb) and the Blue Mosque. Although the areas is pretty busy during daytime, it's remarkably quiet at night. The rooms are not so big, depending on which floor you're on, we stayed on the 6th and the 2nd floor and got the impression that the room on the 6th flor was a bit bigger than on the 2nd. Both rooms were well equipped. The 6th floor bathroom sometimes had a faint sewer smell that disappeared after switching on the a/c. Breakfast on the 7th floor was a nice spread, with great views over the Marmara Sea. At the same floor is the bar, serving good food and a wide choice of drinks. Special thanks to the barkeeper who kept up nice conversations in English and taught me some Turkish. The facilities in the hotel are good, AC works, room and communal areas are clean.  The room is adequate for a short stay, although the bathroom in the room we stayed desperately needs refurbishing.  Breakfast is typical buffet with variety of local cheeses, breads and fruits.  Variety of cereal is also available.  Staff are friendly and helpful. Food was good in restaurant and good selection of drinks at the bar.  Please note if you pay for anything in cash at this hotel ensure you get a receipt as you may be accused of not paying when checking out! Really loved this hotel, every main attraction (main bazaar, hagia Sofia, blue mosque...) is on walking distance!! The staff was really really kind expecially Natia and the cleaning lady Feiza ❤️. Attached to the hotel there are hundreds of markets, also pharmacies, currency change, restaurants....literally everything, you don't need taxi!!! Everything during my stay was fine. From Services to Breakfast, daily cleaning of the room and so on.   I can recommend this hotel for anybody, that needs a good place to stay. It is also close to the Central and beautiful Mosques near by.   Enjoy your trip.  We had a good stay with skalion hotel very good stuff so respctful and helpful the breakfast was so good and the view was wanderful the staff mariem veysel thank you  the loction was closet to the city centre\"},\n",

Gamze went above and beyond to make all our dining experiences superb at the Pera Palace Hotel. She is most attentive to one\\'s needs and a true asset to the hotel. Our room was clean, comfortable, spacious , and yet reminiscent of a bygone era.  Afternoon tea, accompanied by piano music, was delightful. The  Ataturk quarters were historical and the famous elevator, 1 of the 1st of its kind in Europe, are a must see.  Sorry to say this was a real disappointment. We paid top dollar for the Agatha Christie suite, and it was not worth it. The bed was just awful- so uncomfortable that we were in pain each morning. And it is NOT a King Size bed as advertised on the website. Many problems with poor service. The concierge allegedly reserved us a table at a restaurant on-site that was closed. The staff did not know which restaurants/bars were open, and did not know if they served food or not. The bartender in the main bar couldn\\'t make a simple martini. I\\'m so disappointed in this hotel. Would not recommend. We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel. The history of the building is amazing, it even has its very own museum. But in-spite of its grandeur, it is cozy and warm. The staff are friendly and helpful. It is centrally located and situated a hop, skip and jump away from İstiklal Caddesi which offers a wide choice of shopping and restaurants. Beautiful hotel steeped in history. Originally constructed to host the guests of the orient express, this luxurious hotel has hosted the who\\'s who in this part of the world, and is a favorite place of author Agatha Christie (her room can be booked too) where she wrote Murder on the Orient Express. The hotel still has the luxury, elegance and charm of it\\'s old times. The rooms are simple and nice with great views of the golden horn. The restaurant (named Agatha) had an excellent breakfast buffet, the bar and the lounge area were great too. There are many historical artifacts and pictures placed around the hotel to remind of it\\'s legendary history. A unique and wonderful stay. Both evenings there were very noisy events in the hotel which were easily heard from the rooms. The second night this went on very late. It seems the hotel are more focussed on the income from this than the comfort of their resident guests. The room was dark, the bathroom badly lit.  The bar service was inefficient and surly.  The hotel has a lot of history but offers little else. I am not impressed by the staff, brusque and unfriendly. Does not do justice to an otherwise a reasonably nice hotel.  Plus, When you stay in this hotel during busy season it is impossible to get out by taxi as the place seems to be grid locked by extreme traffic congestion. There is no space for guests to sit down and relax whilst waiting for next appointment. All spaces on level level are commercial outlets. Food was also disappointing. My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights during a very busy visit to Istanbul.The hotel was very engaging after we booked.The hotel is quite grand though it’s age is starting to show.We ate in one night but service was painfully slow.Breakfasts were very good. Amazing place in the world I am in love with this hotel amazing I wish i could live there for all my life best place in the world room service is amazing reservations such wonderful people and very historic place you must stay at hotel , this revie is for 2014 I guess, last time in 2023 I went there and I am not satisfied, they have private party that day I can’t use any facilities ( update ) We were in Istanbul for 2 weeks and this was on our list to visit. Has a great reputation and the historical connections with Kemal Ataturk, Agatha Christie and others intrigued us. We went to the patisserie for coffee and pastries while there was a rainstorm outside and loved the turn of the century (late 1800\\'s/early 1900\\'s atmosphere) . The pastries were very good and very pleasant waitress. Was fascinating story about being the first hotel in Istanbul with hot water and electric lighting (think i have that right). Apparently had a major renovation in recent years and it is in perfect condition.                       Great historical hotel, we watch all the Netflix series about this hotel drama and thought we\\'d stay here.  This is a 5 star hotel and has a Micheline restaurant.    We stayed 4 nights.  The breakfast is of a high standard but a little pricey at £21 per person, especially being in Türkiye.  Great high tea (afternoon tea), its a buffet and you eat as much as you like for around £30 each.  Comfortable rooms. I would stay again.  So much history yet updated, comfortable, luxurious.   Staff is so helpful and kind.  Highly recommend. Make sure to watch the video on the TV about the hotel. Staff helped us with restaurant reservations and transportation.   Thankful to have chose this over the other luxury hotels. Highly recommend this hotel. Steeped in history and charm and a great base for exploring the City. Within easy reach of the subway network and with local restaurants and shops close by. Really friendly and helpful people throughout. We did not stay at the hotel.  We wanted to see the place where Agatha Christie wrote Murder in the Orient Express, so we looked for the place aiming to be able to at least take some pictures.  Well, the staff was so kind, and we were not only able to take pictures but also have tea and enjoy the atmosphere. Excellent service at the Orient Terrace. Adem served us well. He was very professional and hospitable. I am happy to recommend any travellers to try it out in the summer nights. It was a memorable night.   My friend and I were  having high tea on Aug.10. The vibe was so great and the sweets were delicate and extremely delicious. Then a manager  called Emrullah showed up. He kindly asked how we felt and volunteerly gave us a tour from the high tea restaurant down to the breakfast dining area. And another Emrullah then offered us a free ride of the over hundred year old elevator. Overall, it was quite an experience for me. I really appreciated what two Emrullahs did to me. You were so kind and hospitable.  The memories will always imprint on me. I will definitely  go back.  It was a perfect stay. The hotel has a fascinating history and is incredibly elegant and well-maintained. The service was flawless and the customer relations manager was fabulous. It’s hard to describe how beautiful the ground floor is and the staff (front desk, restaurant, and cleaning) were all perfect and very professional. I also absolutely loved the historical artifacts on display and the outdoor restaurant. Impressive hotel with an early 20th century \"magical\" aura. The architecture and design make you feel you travelled back in time and hou expect to bump into 1900s European aristocrats on the hallways. The staff is amazing, very welcoming and very accomodating. They made us feel at home (and Nergis definitely went above and beyond to make our stay magical). Location is very good, it\\'s a neighbourhood full of restaurants and shops, walking distance from Taksim Square and Galata Tower. Old neighborhood is 30min away across the Galata Bridge, but the return trip can be longer because Pera area is on a hills area and the streets from Galata bridge are steep. Had a lovely stay stat at the Pera Palace. A touch of old world charm.  Enjoyed the convivial atmosphere of the outdoor oriental bar overlooking Istanbul.  Staff in this area add to the enjoyment. My thanks to. Veysrl and staff for making our staff special.  Throughly enjoyed Istsnbul and Turkry. We are currently staying at Pera Palace hotel Instanbul.  The location is excellent, close to vibrant city streets and transport.  We love the friendly and efficient service of all the staff at Pera palace hotel, particularly the team out on The Orient Terrace. Thank you to Veysel, Mehmet and the team for wonderful service.  We appreciate the friendliness and of course, excellent food!   One day, we’ll be back.                     '},\n",

The location is great! Ms. Suat- General Relations was very helpful and hands on. I stayed for the second time and will probably stay there again on my next visit.  Tariq, the bell boy and the reception staff was very helpful with luggage and arranging taxi to the airport. I have been to Richmond hotel before and it was an amazing experience, and now that I came back to turkey after two years, I had to stay here for the great and welcoming treatment of Mr. Serkan (reception), Serkan (F/B), Engin and Cazim. They care for every detail in our stay and make us feel like a part of their family, we really enjoy chatting with them. They check on us daily and look for us if they didn’t see us. I would also like to thank Mrs. Delara and Birgul at the hotel’s restaurant for being so welcoming and greeting us with big smiles, and if one of us skipped going to the restaurant they would ask and check on us. Special thanks to Mr. Serkan and Engin from the reception for helping in our reservation and upgrading us to the executive floor, that was a really nice I stayed at Richmond hotel when I visited Istanbul for the first time.

Serkan Pelvan and his other friend at the reception are so good people.  Serkan even guided me to the right places for shopping and visit. I was very touched by the way they checked me out up to the taxi and even had a word to the taxi driver ensuring my security to the airport. I will always stay there when visiting Istanbul. I strongly recommend this hotel. My family soon travelling to Istanbul and upon my advise chose to stay there. A big ' Thank you' again to the team. The hotel was amazing!! on Istiklal Street. We took a vacation for our honeymoon and the hotel upgraded us with an amazing suite with a gorgeous view of the Bosphorus.

We felt we were in safe hands all the way in our stay. I couldn’t believe how a member of the staff would go out with us when we orders a taxi and would stay with us until we get in the car just to make sure we are safe. I can keep going and going for hours. Thank you so I am writing to express my sincere gratitude for the wonderful experience my partner and I had during our recent stay at Richmond Hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed our time at your establishment, and it exceeded all our expectations.  From the moment we arrived until the time we checked out, your staff went above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of our stay was memorable. The level of service and attention to detail was truly commendable. Not only did we have a comfortable and relaxing stay, but the thoughtful gesture of surprising us with fruits and wine in honor of our special occasion was genuinely touching.  I would like to personally extend my heartfelt appreciation to three outstanding members of your team who made our stay even more exceptional:  Mert (Front Desk We stayed at the hotel for a week. The hotel is great, clean and comfortable at a good price.  I would like to point out the kind service we received from all the hotel staff. The room service and in the dining room the service was excellent .  It is also important to point out the excellent service we received.  From ms suat/guest relation at richmond iatanbul ,welcoming was  excellent start to our vecation. Hotel location is perfect, in the center of Istiklal Street. It is highly recommended Richmond Hotel Istanbul is a beautiful modern hotel right on Istakil Cadessi. Our room was on 5th floor and had a 180 degree view of the Bosphorous (I reserved this type of room). The room is modern and has a spacious bathroom. The breakfast is very good with lots selections. We visited Istanbul for first time and I’m glad we chose this hotel and this district (very lively and the street is quite wide for Istanbul). If you’re also a first timer to Istanbul, and you’re coming from the airport, take the taxi to hotel (not the bus nor the subway), or perhaps hotel can arrange transport. Hotel is very near to subway and 10 minute walk to tram (not cable car). But do get Istanbulkart at airport or subway not at tram (very crowded). Serkan(Mr).  Ms.Suat.  From  location to check in to breakfast everything is great. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. Location is great fo tourist .  A very nice and comfortable Hotel with wonderful and kind staff. everything was perfect , breakfast very rich we spend three days the hotel very clean, location in very good place all was perfect go enjoy it  I can't say enough about our wonderful experience at this hotel.  - Let me start with the amazing and helpful staff. They were extremely accommodating! They checked us in as early as they could, like 10 in the morning early! and served us delicious coffee while waiting for our room! -I can't tell enough how meticulously clean it was; from the room to the restaurant, and bathrooms ( in the room and in the lobby)   -The beds were extra comfy with cushiony pillows! Extremely comfortable! -Although the hotel was on a popular and busy street ( Istikbal) we couldn't be bothered by the outdoor noise at all! (except for the daily prayers call which were on the loudspeaker!) but honestly for me was a nostalgic memory although I'm not Turkish! -The restaurant and breakfast were very good We did pass 8 days in this hotel  we were very satisfied .the rooms are big ,clean and calm. Before getting there ,we were thinking that it's going to be noisy as the hotel is in Istiklal avenue but on the contrary no noise at all. The personal is very amable and nice  the service was excellent. Thanks a lot to the staff especially to Mr Mert,Mr Ergin ,Ms Suat,Mr Osman who made our journey confortable and satisfactory.                                         \"},\n",

I would like to mention one other thing as well: quality of staff. They went beyond my expectations, especially Yusuf helped me out enormously with his efforts. First of all the taxi is very big problem in this side. Some nights too much noise we had. This situation is very annoying and unacceptable for 5 star hotel. But for all that the staff is excellent. Especially Mr Yusuf, Mr Eren very helpful. I was feel as special person. Thanks for all. Also Ouzo and Jigger very nice restaurants. There are my recommend. Lobby bar was great  Melih the waiter was great The room is great and the view is amazing  For sure I will come back in summer 2 restaurants on top floor .. pool are amazing too  Fast check in ..room upgraded.. The Greek restaurant on the top floor was great .. good mezze .. The afternoon tea was fantastic but the service from Ersin Con was even better. Very attentive and helpful. Really great service and Mr Con is an asset to the hotel. Fantastic man.  I would recommend anyone to go and have afternoon tea with great service from him. After more than 120 nights corporate stays in this hotel - regrettably no way to stay at it again, purely based on an inexperienced receptionist by the name of Burcu.  Terrible communication and even when complaining to reception office and requesting a conversation with the GM I only get a card as per attached.  Terrible corporate experience and definitely a no go ! I stayed at Wyndham Kalamis in November for 5 days. Unfortunately, after my check-out, I realized that I forgot my charger for the headset, valued at 200€. Since my time in Istanbul was limited, I asked the concierge if they could post it to my address on the European side of the city. The hotel confirmed my request and initiated the process.  While I did receive my headset charger, it arrived broken in the middle, rendering the headset unusable. Despite the item being fragile, it was placed in a protective fridge bag, not protected at all! Upon contacting the hotel, they shifted blame onto the carrier. I even visited the hotel for a face-to-face conversation, but their only solution was to offer a discount at their restaurant instead of compensating for the loss!  After two Very convenient area to stay for my business trip. All staff was very polite & helpful. The hotel was clear with nice environment. The breakfast was great with a big variety of different choices. I would definitely stay at this hotel again                                                            \"},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': '                    Very convenient location.   Staff very friendly but if you are a couple and need two room keys, you have to ask for it.  No porter to help with luggage.   Limited restaurants in the airport and food quality at the restaurant is average.  It s busy because it is open to all people in the airport, and there are only two to three  sandwich/coffee places before check-in point.  The guys were hospitable and very friendly. Nice place to relax after a long flight from Los Angeles. They are very bilingual, English perfect. The meal was excellent and the taste I desired. Please don’t forget to stop here whenever you arrive at Istanbul International Airport, Yotel restaurant  I have stayed at this place few times already (and actually wrote a reasonably nice review sometimes in 2022).  Two weeks ago I got a promotional \"Black Friday Sale\" e-mail from Yotels.  As I am already planning few trip later in a year, I decided to use this offer.  Few exclusions were listed in this e-mail including Yotel Istanbul Airside.  But Youtel Istanbul Land Side WAS NOT ONE OF THEM.  As a matter of fact, I got an additional e-mail today and it is still not listed as an exclusion.  Still I was not able to book from the web site a discount rate and wrote to hotel asking for help.  The response was that they are excluded from the promotion.  I pointed to their own website and was told that nothing can be done, but they can provide a ten % discount instead of the 40% on Convenient for an overnight stay directly at the airport.  Rooms are clean, but the lobby smells bad. Overprized, they charge for the convenient location. Not the friendliest of service, but ok.  Rooms are comfortable.  The bar and restaurant were excellent.  Service by seref  and osman was first class!  Well done.  Food was good as well.  Will definitely return next visit to Istanbul airport.  Perfect Moscow Mules!  Kommunity restaurant is very good! Every time we come through Istanbul for overnight between flights, we eat dinner here. Great food, great service. Our waiter Seref did a great job. Thank you, Seref, for the outstanding service! We had the lentil soup, spaghetti bolognese, salmon, and Tiramissu  The food was great and so was the service everyone was super nice and accommodating. The rooms are very modern and clean. Great stay and very convenient for the plane. The wake up call was very good and great accommodations.  Room was clean and compact with all amenities. Good location as hotel was  located not far from  check in area. Staff were very nice and helpful. Breakfast excellent for the price with a range of options. The staff was very accommodating and the service at komyunity was excellent. Thanks to Seref for a great experience he went above and beyond! I would definitely like to stay here again. Loved the margarita pizza. If you have an over night layover and you are confused by Turkish air’s policy for business class passengers overnight allowances and you don’t want to hassle with passport control this is for you. I felt like I was walking into a space station sleeping module. Very utilitarian use of space. The room features an adjustable bed which when the head is raised allows you to get to the bathroom                     Stayed here for convenience  High price - €290 if you book ... €390 if you walk in   Rooms are perfectly fine.  Last day of our holidays so we decided to have a few drinks in the bar .  2 x vodkas with a mixer , 3 beers , 6 Irish whiskeys no mixer... wait for it  €290 ... I KID YOU NOT.  TIP taxi outside € 10... 10 mins and your in a perfectly good clean and close Hotel for €50.  After 94  countries....THIS IS THE BIGGEST RIP OFF....EVER    Hotel located inside the airport  terminal so perfect for a tired traveler on an overnight connection. Very clean and quiet. Rooms modern and functional,  lighting cold, bathroom  okay - really just a plastic pod. Outrageously expensive  for what you get, taking advantage  of location in the huge airport of Istanbul We enjoyed our stay in the Yotel Istanbul Aiport and would stay again though it was expensive.  Our room was new, comfortable, clean and quiet.   We arrived at hotel around 1 a.m. and left around 10 a.m., which was an optimal time to sleep and when the airport is quieter.  My only other experience with a Transit Hotel was at Incheon Airport, where we arrived in the morning and flew out in the early evening.  The hotel in Incheon Airport was noisy with staff talking outside our room and the room was very worn down.  We did not get much sleep at Incheon Airport.  It was the complete opposite at Yotel Istanbul Aiport an enjoyable experience. The hotel is attached to the airport - a real plus given that you\\'ll probably arrive by air or taxi. It\\'s generally very clean and the staff was very friendly.  Unfortunately the shower stall in our room was pitched such that gallons of water leaked out under the shower door given that the seal there was defective. We spent twenty minutes soaking up water with the very few towels in the room. Having spent time on our knees doing so and observing the floor and furnishings - it was clear this had happened before.  Considering the time constraint to make our flight it was just easier to clean up the mess instead of waiting for staff. We reported the problem upon checkout without any consideration being given. The restaurant in the place was decent and had a good bar. The Yotel Istanbul (Landside) is a great place to overnight in Istanbul for a tour and flight the following day.  I checked hotels away from the airport and by the time you would pay a taxi or shuttle service to and from the hotel off site, Yotel onsite was the better deal.  The Yotel was extremely clean and very quiet for a good night\\'s sleep.  Also very comfortable beds. Short stay for the next destination to Kabul, Afghanistan, it was a good experience for me and my mom, thank you for your hospitality and looking after us, I would highly recommend the stay for others.  After recent remodel, this place is way easier to find among the BladeRunner-isque mall that is the IST International Airport.  * Ebru @ front desk AMAZING!* Enjoyed a quiet room with a comfy bed.  Warmed some towels for after shower. Busted out the cozy slippers. Relaxing. 🙌 Functional for an overnight transit or visit with meetings to Istanbul.  Rooms are good sized and staff friendly although internet can be hit and miss in the room - common areas seem to work well. the showers and toilets are functioning ut you would probably only want a single due to privacy. The room we had was spacious and quiet, the bed was very comfortable. I think the hotel could provide more toiletries since they charge a lot for the room. But otherwise, everything was fine. I would definitely recommend this hotel. We did not try to food at the hotel, and left way before breakfast.  We only bought a few snacks from the shops in the airport. We needed a hotel in the Istanbul airport for an early morning flight. The Yotel Hotel Landside did the job. The rooms, while small, were clean and the bed was comfortable. The wake up call was right on time, the staff were pleasant, all was good.  One thing to keep on mind, is that the directions to the security were given assuming we had checked in and dropped our checked luggage at our airline.   We had not.   And, somehow, we managed to get our large luggage through security as if it was carry on ( they did seize a nice corkscrew, which should have been a clue), and once we figured it what we did, had to make a decision to either exit the airport to go through check in, passport and then security again, or trust that the airline would allow our bags at the gate and store'},\n",

Every time we experience an improved service keeping the best Quality. Hotel Lobby, Reception, are totally renovated with luxurious and modern design, club lounge is on ground floor added a great experience to our stay. The memorable stay and professional services started with reservation team fulfilling our request with prompt response and high end care. My parents wedding Anniversary was in June and the Hotel were super lovely to arrange for my parents beautiful room arrangements for this occasion, having flowers and nice gestures that surpassed our expectations. Being in club rooms, the Hotel were amazing to offer us same club rooms 1809 and 1808 at floor 18 , My wife and I stayed at this property 27 June -2 July. The location of the hotel is great. A lot of things to do within walking distance. The staff is just amazing. When we arrived we were greeted with warmth and a welcoming spirit. Special appreciation to Duygu who made our stay very pleasant. You need more people like her. The club intercontinental is fantastic. The garden makes sitting outside enjoyable. The room with sea view was very nice. I highly recommend this property. Best wishes .   Dawit Teklu xcellent hotel and location , we booked 2 rooms , front desk , housekeeping , security, restaurent staff extremely good and helpful, rooms very clean with nice views, we were allowed late chkout with no trouble, very near taksim sqaure and bosphorous I stayed for three nights in April 2023 while traveling for business. The hotel itself was truly magical, but I must admit that it didn't quite justify its price. It was rather expensive, and if I were paying out of my own pocket, I would doubt my decision to stay there. On a positive note, the bar on the top floor offered a breathtaking view. The staff was consistently polite and readily available, which was commendable. The use of Byredo cosmetics was a delightful touch, adding to the overall experience. However, it's worth noting that when returning from downtown to the hotel, be prepared for taxi drivers who may overcharge you under the assumption that you are staying at the IC and therefore must be wealthy. I stayed there with my family for 13 nights during the month of May. The staff made our stay memorable. The club floors are great. The guest relations, lead by Victoria turns any issue into a happy story to be told. The breakfast is a beautiful symphony lead by Ali, Eren, Levent, erdu, and all other staff. They pampered us and other guests and everyone feels like royalty. Hotel was clean everywhere. Staff were helpful and cheerful.  They also made a way out to help you when you need it. My colleague and i needed to book a cab from the street and the staff took initiative to get one for us.  We were assisted by great staff throughout our stay and their service was genuine and natural.  Special thanks to Mehsut, Veysel, Gulseda and Bahar.   Thanks. We absolutely loved our stay at the Intercontinental - what a special, beautiful hotel. The best I have ever stayed in in a city. The rooms were incredibly comfortable (helped by the pillow menu available at reception if you wish to switch your pillow), the Skybar was fantastic (great music and stunning views of the Bosphorus at night) and the service was exceptional. Every person we met who worked there was friendly, professional and helpful and we were so impressed that, at breakfast halfway through our stay my husband wrote on a comments card how much he loved the french toast and from that point on, the chefs made sure it was available every morning for the rest of our stay. Wonderful attention to detail. We hope to stay with you all again one day, thank you for taking such Hotel was under renovation. Our rooms were club class but very old fashioned. Plug points to charge our phones etc we’re not there beside the bed.  Need to surely renovate the rooms. Service was good.  Housekeeping was not upto 5 star standard. We were there for 4 nights.  They were nice. They gave us delayed check out. That’s extremely important.  Location is extremely good.  Fantastic location ! High quality luxury rooms! ( especially the Bosphorous view rooms) Amazing breakfast spread! Great spa! The new lobby is world class and extremely hospitable staff   This has to be among the top rated intercontinental hotels  in the world !  The concierge got us into some sold out shows as well. The Intercontinental is on a hill above the city and gives commanding views from your room and the 14th floor restaurants and bar. The splendor does not end there. The room I had on the 12th floor was amazing, no matter the weather. The room was spacious and had a huge bathroom with all the amenities and plush towels.   The location is near Taksim Square and there is a beautiful mosque and many shops and places to eat. It is a steep walk to the waterfront where there are ferries and tours.  Although there was renovations in the lower floor, the breakfast restaurant and check in area worked well. The staff were always most pleasant and helpful and were there when you needed them.

Would throughly recommend this hotel  We will certainly be returning again The hotel is perfectly placed for all the tourist attractions and restaurants, all in walking distance. It is also only 2 mins from the tram line, which provides easy and quick access the greater city.   Staff are friendly, helpful and welcoming. The breakfast one of the best we have experienced and the Spa is wonderful.  Highly recommend this hotel for a perfect and relaxing stay in Istanbul. The dining restaurant's breakfast is exquisite, expertly planned, and beautifully presented. We much appreciate your assistance, and the hotel personnel was immaculate. People were very helpful and kind. The concierge was excellent. This is a five-star review from a sincere traveler around the globe. I'm grateful for everything. I choose this hotel  because i read very good review on it..and everything was True!! It is small hôtel but this is why it is soo good you feel so welcomed and they really make you feel at home..it is very good choice for à 1st stay ..all the staff was very caring and helpful thank you to mr Kadri but a very very spécial mention for Emre...he was soo helpful for helping with discovering istanbul and for advising the spa treatments too in the pell palace hotel ..he represent turquish hospitality!!!   The room is very clean.. I travel safe as à woman i felt  safe in this hotel and area  too..very closed to touristic site  I will definetely recommand pell palace and the price is good too   I will definitely start by saying the hotel staff are very friendly and help with any concern or query. 2 in particular were Semiha (cleaner) she was so friendly and smiley every time we left our room. Always saying hello and would walk up the stairs just to greet us in the morning. Second staff member I did not catch his name but he was a gentleman from Nepal. He was extremely friendly and whenever he would see us he would have the biggest smile and gave us a goodbye gift off the hotel which was so nice.  The receptionists were also friendly and helped us book taxis and a boat tour.  However, I need to mention the room. This was extremely unfortunate as when we arrived they initially gave us a room which had not been cleaned and I asked the receptionist after a long flight and This is the perfect hotel to stay at for a sightseeing trip to Istanbul. It’s only a 10 minute walk to the major attractions. Rooms were very clean and nice and the spa was absolutely an amazing experience. The daily breakfast was good but the best part of the hotel was the staff. They were so accommodating and helpful. They upgraded our room, gave us recommendations, provided us with complementary tea and helped us with our airport transfer. Would definitely stay here again. Great location, comfortable and clean room. Good breakfast, helpful and knowledgeable staff. Within walking distance for main attractions. Tram service for connection to both new and old towns 5 minute walk. Highly recommended Excellent stay. Local to all places. Easy to get to. The place was clean and had all amenities. The Staff was superb especially Kadir. Amazing guy and very helpful. Will recommend to all. Will definitely come back here  We stayed in family room with a large balcony on the fourth floor. Pluses: 1. Room was clean and spacious. 2. The service was amazing and the team of young men were helpful and friendly. 3. We have used hotel’s transfer service and were really pleased with the minibus and organization. I would recommend it. 4. Breakfast menu changes daily and has a great variety. 5. Location is very convenient for the most of the attractions. However, it’s on the trade street with a lot of empty boxes and litter around on the evening which spoils the location personally for me.  Minuses is nothing to do with the hotel but I will point them out because it may be helpful. 1. As I mentioned before, it locates on the wholesale trade street with boxes and empties. 2. Our room was facing towards back Firstly the location of the hotel is central to many amenities and historical sites. The hotel it's self is clean and inviting, room was spacious and comfortable. Cleaners  were very thorough. The staff at Pell Palace were all amazing and couldn't do enough to help. Would highly recommend this hotel, it will definitely highlight the beauty of Istanbul.                                          Hotel is in a great location, within walking distance of the Grand Bazaar, the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Basilica Cistern etc. and located close to a tram station to access any tourist sights further away. We had a great experience as a family and all staff were extremely accommodating, especially Ramazan who went above and beyond to ensure our needs were met. The spa in particular is great. The service overall was amazing and I would recommend to anyone looking for somewhere central to stay in Istanbul! Thank you once again for your outstanding hospitality and assistance 😄 Great city hotel, In a good location to walk to nearby sights. The hotel is on a steep hill so be wary for weak legs. However the location is close to the tram and walking distance to grand baazaar and sulhanmet area.   Staff at pell Palace were very friendly and accommodating. Emre helped with our transfer from the airport and providing a travel card to get on the trams and organisation of use of the spa.  Rooms vary in size but all were clean and big enough, bathrooms provide towels, shower gel, shampoo & conditioner (smells great)! Water pressure is very good.   Breakfast was a continental breakfast lots of meats and cheese, fruit, qnd bread, was fine for a city hotel and for a few days to eat.   Great stay at pell Palace  Brilliant location, all main tourist attractions within 15min walking distance. Room could be a little bigger however, overall definitely worth the money. Brother ramazan very helpful with any needs and help we needed Really nice hotel, located on a “shoes street”, it’s quite in the evening, the location is really good if your destinations are tourists’ sights To Istiklyal about 30 min walk. The stuff is really friendly and nice. Rooms are not big at all, if you sleep lightly, take earplugs, because you will hear your neighbor singing in his bath or the rumor from the street in the early morning.  Breakfast are practically similar every morning.  I have stayed here for 6 night with my parents and we had best possible experience, we could ever imagine. The room was clean, fresh, not noisy, enough storage and space and breakfast was delicious, with various choices and changing from day to day. Food was warm and fresh and staff knowledgeable and kind. Every member of staff, from reception to cleaning ladies were kind, friendly and helpful, which made us feel welcome and part of one huge family. Hotel staff went above and beyond helping us with arranging safe taxi journeys from alms to airport, helping with flight tickets or any enquiries we needed. We have even received incredible gift so we can cherish our memories forever and hopefully come back there again soon! We miss highly everyone and keeping them in our hearts. I recently had the pleasure of staying at your hotel and I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the excellent service provided by the reception team (Ramazon and others). Their willingness to assist, friendly demeanor and extensive knowledge about the hotel and the surrounding area made my stay even more enjoyable.  I would also like to extend my gratitude to Nezokett for the wonderful massage and Hamam experience. It was truly a relaxing and rejuvenating experience.  Thank you once again for the exceptional service provided during my stay at your hotel. I look forward to visiting again in the near future.  Really helpful staff, even very late in the evening when we needed some help with printing off Airport check in details they were happy to support. Nothing was too big of an ask. Always welcoming whenever you came into the lobby and never failed to make great tea! The hotel is modern and clean, and the spa hammam treatment was fantastic. In a central location walking distance from the main attractions which is a massive plus. Pell palace hotel was a lovely place to stay at and was in a perfect location. The staff were amazing. Most pleased by the treatment as they were very obliging. They looked after our every need. One member of the team which was most helpful was Ramazan amongst others. The rooms were very clean, which is important to me due to my allergies. The spa was excellent and the ladies looked after us well. Appreciated the kindness of the staff towards friends who weren’t part of the hotel. They were most pleased and even decided they will stay with Pell palace hotel next Istanbul trip.   I had such a great stay at Pell Palace. I was treated with respect and kindness throughout my stay. I came with my friends who stayed at another hotel. They were in awe with how helpful and accommodating the staff were. The hotel is in a great location. Walking distance from the blue mosque and main attractions. Thank you Pell Palace. Will definitely stay again if I come to Istanbul. Great hotel located centrally to most tourist attractions, the staff were FANTASTIC- they would go above and beyond, extremely accommodating. The Spa was excellent, felt at ease and had a good old laugh with the lovely ladies working in there. Overall a beautiful hotel to stay at and would definitely recommend! Most importantly my friends from another hotel were treated with the same respect when they came to this hotel to see us, which also showed a lovely side to the staff! It was all in all a beautiful stay.\"},\n",

The resturant service a really good food Stunning hotel with a beautiful grand reception. We were given a free upgrade to a lovely suite. The staff are all great - very helpful and friendly. Location is away from the main tourist attractions, as is in a more business area. Lots of conferences etc happening. The hotel arranged transfers for me from the airport at a cost of ¢85 each way. In typical Istanbul airport style for pre booked cars there was a 20min wait in the cold for the driver surrounded by smokers.   The hotel was about 30min drive from the airport and when we finally did get there the hotel staff were very welcoming. Check in was quick and easy thanks to a lovely receptionist who also kindly gave me a couple of adaptors to use as I'd left mine back at home. The concierge were very friendly and quickly helped me get everything to my room.   The room was okay, no sound proofing so you hear everyone in the hall and neighbouring rooms. The heating was on high so it was hot and the unit was also loud. That went straight off and the room stayed a nice temperature. Tea and The hotel and the staff have a very welcoming feeling and attitude. You’re greeted with a smile and reception was warm and speedy. It has a nice big lobby with a waterfall and a coffee shop at the back. Room was cozy and clean and modern. Bed is on the orthopedic side which I am not a fan of. Bathroom is impeccably clean with rain shower. They have a hair salon, a huge swimming pool good for laps, a sauna, huge steam room and hamam room separate lockers for men and women. Breakfast is buffet and plentiful with large assortment of cheese, fresh fruits and bread. I would rate this hotel 5+ if I can.  It’s also closer to the new airport and the huge mall of Istanbul. I definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again whenever I’m in Istanbul. Shout out to Sagla, the Amazing place to make B2B business and having an amazing time. I'll be back here again and again. Thanks to Birsen she helped me alot.  Breakfast are yummy. Gym and swimming pool are great. Stuff are super duper friendly. I like to stay here .. Though the hotel was really nice, I was a little disappointed there were no bath robes and I had to ask for hangers multiple time. The location is OK if u are with people as its only a 15min taxi ride away from the main sites but a little far for a solo traveller. The hotel itself was very nice, very clean and the staff were exceptional.  Everything is very well. At the check out Ms Melisa helped me quickly and she is very kind person. Thank you also to Mr Emre Suât Can and Birsen. Everyone is very helpful and professional. I recommended this Hotel I like the beautiful property and the beautiful hotel Reception Staff Mrs suat and guest relations Ms Birsen   You will not be disappointed with staying at this property,  extremely elegant   Very helpful and nice   This hotel may look nice but trust me the shocking service is appalling. Rude concierge staff - extremely unhelpful and despite several requests for taxi, we were left disregarded whilst local people e.g. Turkish people given priority.  I was considering this hotel for an event in October but wouldn’t trust them to be professional and courteous.  Avoid this hotel and go elsewhere.  When I come to Hotel Ms Melisa welcomed us. She insterest everything, reservations hotel everything. So kind so helpful person. I will come back this Hotel because of Melisa.

The staff are super friendly and really try to help (Yash, Johnny and  all the others) whether it is on restaurant tip or hotel amenities. Great place.! The ambiance and room were so cute and clean. We fell in love as soon as we walked through the doors. The staff were all so sweet and the pineapple them was so unique and fun! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to SF! We will definitely be back again in the future! We loved this place! Super nice staff and beautiful room. The robes are so soft and love all the pineapple touches! The free drinks at checkin was a really nice perk. Close to so many delicious places, too. I had a delightful stay at Staypineapple. Yash provided exceptional assistance upon arrival, and throughout my stay, the staff at reception were consistently friendly and welcoming. When it was time to check out, Johnny and Yas were both friendly, making my overall experience memorable. I highly recommend this hotel. Lovely room, great location for getting around the city, would come back, staff were always in hand and friendly, beds comfortable and the shower amazing, we also kept Dash the dog, waking distance to loads or the stations, highly recommend  We really enjoyed the Maxwell - and all the pineapple-related perks.  Friendly staff, easy check in and check out, on-site bar and restaurant, and incredibly comfortable beds and linens!  And fantastic location for adjacency to Seattle Center.  One small nit:  I would stay here again anytime, but experience would be enhanced with even a small fitness center.  And I didn\\'t visit the pool but I was told it was \"green\"  Check in really efficient, all the staff on the desk were super friendly and helpful during our stay. Rooms really unique, proper duvets a unique and welcome touch. Room comfortable and clean. Good central location for city centre, a few mins walk away, easy transport links. Area a little shady with homeless and drugs, but this is a citywide issue and not unique, felt very secure at hotel, both entry and elevators access controlled and really not an issue, but something to be aware of the whole city. WOW! This property definitely exceeded my expectations. From the moment I placed a call and spoke with Yenni, I knew my boyfriend and I were in good hands.  Upon our arrival, I was greeted with warm smiles, water, and a level of Customer Service I had almost forgotten. This property is super clean, very elegant, and pet friendly. Your rooms are laid out almost in the same fashion as being on a cruise. There are fluffy pillows, thick towels, warm robes, and a little stuffed animal that you can take home with you.  We came into town from Sacramento to see The Lion King. we wanted to splurge and have a romantic day of it all. And Staypineapple was the perfect compliment.  We will definitely be back! I was charged three times for my stay and had to file a dispute with my credit card to get my payment back. I made the reservation and paid in full through a third party, trip.com. When I checked in, the hotel had my reservation in the system and took my card for the resort fee, which I authorized. Two days after checking out, I received a charge from the hotel for the stay, in addition to the resort fee. I called, the hotel apologized, and reversed the charge. I was then charged again two weeks later for the stay. I called and was told that trip.com hadn\\'t paid the hotel yet and that I needed to work it out with trip.com directly (whom I had already paid and whose accounts receivable process I have zero jurisdiction over). Over the course of the next 4 days, I called and spoke                     Comfortable bedding and great service! Yani was so sweet and greeted us very nicely every morning. I’d suggest everyone & anyone to come stay at pineapple hotel! The rooms are so cute and very well taken care of  A very nice spot in downtown San Francisco. The decorations and amenities are well worth the modest service fee. There is a nice breakfast bar with food and coffee for the morning. They also give you a complementary afternoon beverage as well when you check in. It’s a must stay for the business or leisure traveler in this location.  Great hotel!  Nice staff, fun theme and great location.  Arnold at the front desk was delightful. The decor in the lobby is very stylish and the amenities were nice as well. Definitely staying here again.  Great location, on the corner of Geary and Jones. Literal mins away from Union Square and several restaurants around. I read many great reviews abt Yanny and she definitely holds up to what people say (friendly, welcoming and professional)!! Room was very clean, nice bed/pillow. Overall, would recommend and I, myself, would book here again.  I was greeted warmly by Yeshi at the Front Desk. She made shire I was taken care of and explained the amenities of the hotel clearly.   The room is very nice. Clean! Comfortable.   Very pleased with my stay.  This hotel is wonderful. The bedding is so comfortable. Our room was so adorable. The rooms are on the smaller side but they have everything you would need and more. I loved all the small touches that this hotel offered. The staff goes above and beyond! It was our honeymoon and Yani called me and asked if we would like breakfast or bottle of wine in celebration. When we got back to our room there was a chilled bottle of wine set up so nice for us. Yani was so kind. I wish every hotel had staff as great as she is!! I saw her as we were checking out and she asked us how our stay was and offered so many kind words. I did not want to leave!! I will definitely stay here again.  My sister and I had a wonderful visit in StayPinapple in San Francisco. The staff were super helpful, kind, and informative. I loved the symbolism and tradition of the pineapple welcoming guests. They had bicycles available to tour the city. Overall I also felt safe and secure. Can’t wait to come back next year. From the moment we entered the hotel we were charmed by the decor and friendliness of the staff. The room was small but quaint and just lovely. We arrived a couple hours before check in, however the staff let us leave our luggage on hold while we went out for a stroll and dinner. And on the last day we checked out left our luggage again and Arnold took great care of us… thank you  This hotel is so luxurious. Immediately as you walk in it smells so nice and soothing. They have a lovely cafe and seating area in the lobby. The bed came with two comforters and the softest pillows. On top of that, they have robes and a cute plush dog sitting on the bed to greet you. I will be staying here again and recommending this place to other family members and friends. Thank you StayPineapple!  Yesha was an excellent host. She was quite gracious to let us check-in early after such a long flight. She went out of her way to ensure we enjoyed our stay. Thank you Yesha and staypineapple. We’ll definitely be back.                    '},\n",

The bathroom had hooks for robes ( robes on request) but no rail for towels. Would stay again & highly recommend.  A 7 night business trip to SF was booked at a big chain hotel.  It was loud and impersonal- nothing special. However, I stumbled into the Beacon, and was greeted by the amazing hospitality offered by Leif who showed me my alt options- I instantly cancelled and stayed all week! What a great choice- this is my new SF 'home.' gorgeous renovation, artistic, special, beautiful history, and detail with a warm and chic vibe. Every single employee demonstrated service, care and warmth.  Now, I won't stay anywhere else and can't wait to return! The bar is fabulous, with experienced and accommodating bartenders Henry and Anson and Greg, the whisky library expert. Be sure to check out the gorgeous murals and ceilings. Nothing I would change. Love the staff and can't wait to see them all I was charged 2 nights for vale but I used it only for 27 hours and I was told that it was going to be fixed and reimbursed. Not happened and was not informed about it. Unexpected expenses charged without informing  Great location, and friendly staff. Felt very comfortable with security.  Walkable to dinner, and the cable cars stopping right in front of the hotel was a great benefit.  It made our trip easy and fun.   We stayed at the Beacon Grand Hotel to celebrate the New Year and for a post Christmas holiday and what a fine way to welcome in the New Year it was too! We checked in just before New Year, had a wonderful dinner and drinks on New Years Eve, and stayed in a classic double on a high floor with a city view. Our room was spacious, stylish, and comfortable although perhaps could have done with more wardrobe space but was very well equipped nonetheless including a coffee machine, hair dryer and chaise lounge perfect for lounging on. Previously known as The Sir Francis Drake Hotel, the Beacon Grand retains a sense of grand style and has kept some interesting features including high ceilings, brass fixtures and fittings, and the old US mail postal chute while adding modern features Emma, the woman who checked us in, was wonderful! We stayed one night in a standard room, and one night in a junior suite. The standard room was good, but I highly recommend a junior suite. The chairs, sofa and extra space make a tremendous difference after a long day of sightseeing.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the beacon grand hotel in San Francisco. The staff was very courteous and responsive.  Rooms have been refreshed and the bed linens are amazing. Also love the water station.  Hats off to the beacon grand! This hotel is the perfect combination: of stately decor and friendly familiarity, of a great history (it is almost a century old) and contemporary comfort, of a central location and the quietness of a retreat. We were there for five nights and it is no exaggeration to say that we were pampered: everything was just right, from the firm mattress and the fluffy pillows of the bed to the excellent breakfasts always served with a smile and affectionate greetings, from the timely and discrete cleaning services to the water bottles given for free, which will now be a memory of days and nights well spent. For once, we decided to stay away from big chains like Marriott because we found them to be compromised with the apartheid system in Israel, and the outcome was the most beautiful We went to SF for an early celebration of our 30th wedding anniversary. The Beacon Grand was the perfect way to celebrate. Everything from the second we arrived was first class. We enjoyed the restaurant and the bar multiple times. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly.  We will definitely return Thank you Grand experience!  Staff is incredibly welcoming and charming.  The architecture offers a portal to an era of refinement and dazzle.  Ask about the authentic speakeasy... if you are a history buff, you'll be in for a treat (no alcohol is served). Staying at The Beacon Grand for NYE with my family has become a tradition for us because of this hotel. Beautiful hotel, generous pet policy, wonderful staff & the rooms are beautiful. Beds are one of the most comfortable I’ve slept in. Location can’t be beat. The service was excellent on all levels.  The rooms were clean and nice and new.  No carpet on the floor which I liked.  Go see Anson at the bar.  He makes amazing craft cocktails that will keep you coming back.  The food was excellent as well. A superb new expression of this San Francisco landmark hotel (formerly the Sir Francis Drake). With a great central location just off Union Square, it’s luxurious and beautifully updated. My 20th-floor room overlooking Union Square was noisy at Christmas with the bustle of shopping, busking, cabs honking and cable cars clanging up and down Powell Street, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. It’s quintessentially San Francisco.   The bed was sumptuous, with a foot-thick down comforter and a mattress that must have been stuffed with clouds. The bathroom is small (obviously the original size from the 1920s) but nicely clad in marble and stylish tile. I loved the friendly bar just above the reception area. Service was excellent, although I had trouble with the elevators not Always a nice and welcoming place to arrive and sorry to leave. The accommodations are only outdone by the staff and service. The rooms are pleasantly furnished and the ability to connect to your own streaming service is an unexpected benefit. Truly an amazing Christmas trip. Proximity to everything, joyful cable car sounds, delicious food and restaurants, fantastic service, lovely people, festive atmosphere, beautiful renovations of an historic hotel ----- A+++ Really liked the casualness of this hotel. All of the amenities were on point. The gym was amazing. Great location. Super accommodating staff. Drinks and food were over priced which is too bad because there are too many options nearby to give it a shot.  I had a very pleasant two night stay at the Beacon. I upgraded to a higher floor and the room was a little bigger than the standard room on the lower floors. The room was very clean and well maintained as expected for a freshly remodeled classy hotel. The staff, including the front desk, door people, and restaurant team were all very nice and helpful.  The only issue I had during this trip was the the noise level of the party in the next room.   Great experience from the moment we stepped in to the hotel. Front desk “Alma” was very helpful and kind. Answered all my questions. Thank you Alma. This was my fiancés first time to San Francisco and we are now planning on returning in the spring. We’ll definitely be staying at the Beacon Grand. Thank you  This hotel is right in the middle of everything in downtown San Francisco. The public rooms are really nice.....lobby, bar, lounge. Staff was very helpful. The menu in the lounge offers good choices. Happy hour is a lively time there, with piano music and lots of energy!  The staff was generally rude and unhelpful, with the exception of the doorman. When I discovered that they don't provide hair dryers in the room, I called down to the front desk, but they never answered the phone. I eventually had to go to my work meeting with wet hair.   The service in the bar/lounge was terrible. I have worked in food service before and I tend to be very forgiving, but I cannot recommend this spot.   Also, a guest's dogs were barking all night. I tried to call down to the front desk, but you can imagine what happened (nobody answered).  It’s a very nice hotel with a good restaurant. In my opinion and experience the cleaning service good be better. There were some things in the room from the previous visitor (an empty water bottle in the bathroom and cigarettes in the drawer) and the toilet was not flushed. Nicely updated from the Sir Francis Drake.  A grand dame of Union Square with a lot of history in its walls but nicely upgraded so everything works nicely and is clean.   Can’t beat the location.  Always enjoyed staying when it was Sir Francis Drake.  Will certainly staying as the Beacon Grand. Excellent downtown location just off Union Square, although there was street noisy from early morning until late at night. Grandiose entrance area but rooms basic. Bedroom was modern and adequate for 1 person but bathroom was old fashioned and extremely small. Would not categorize this as a 4 star hotel. I had stayed at this hotel on my first visit to SF with my dad and was excited to return. While the entrance and lobby were grandiose, my room was tiny. The queen bed filled most of the space and the huge wall-mounted TV blocked the access to the desk by the window. I was promised a view and instead the room faced another building. The amenities were minimal: no fridge, microwave or kettle, only a coffeemaker and hairdryer. The rate I paid for this tiny room was ridiculously expensive and probably due to the location.  Really loved the throwback feel of the hotel. The room was great and the bed was very comfy. Plus there was a small couch with plenty of room to kick back. Staff was very attentive and accommodating.  I will definitely be back.  Beautiful old Sir Francis Drake Hotel revamped and revitalized.  The service was top notch.  The room was small but very comfortable and efficient.  The bed was comfortable.  The restaurant offered a very nice brunch, pricey, but very good. My wife and I stayed here earlier this year while the hotel was still under renovations and our stay back then was not quite as we had hoped. We recently tried again with the hotel completed and decorated for the Christmas holiday and we're pleasantly surprised with the 180 turnaround. The hotel staff were all very friendly and happy to help assist as they could. If you get a chance to stay in one of their suites, I strong encourage you to try one out. They are very spacious and clean. The bed was super comfortable, which is a new to me for a hotel.   Though we couldn't stay to try the food, we'll just have to return again for another visit. After our stay at the Beacon Grand, I'll definitely be sharing my review with friends and family to have a look for themselves.  We were in area for a show and normally drive home after, but decided to stay the evening and we were glad we did. Clean room. The valet and front desk staff were wonderful. I normally do not stay near Union Square, since it can be very touristy, but I found the location nice and central.  I stayed at the Beacon Grand for 4 nights for a business trip. It's a vintage hotel that's been renovated-- meaning you get charm and mostly modern conveniences. The room was incredibly clean and surprisingly spacious. My main issue was the tiny bathroom, which was very snug and uncomfortable. There was a massive walk-in closet, though, which was handy but an odd use of space. Still, the hotel is really nice (though be prepared to WAIT for the elevators) and was a great value for what you get. Our stay was great! The best part was the staff. The gentlemen who greeted us at the entrance and assisted us were top-notch. They were very friendly, helpful and made our stay exceptional. The room was very clean. The bed was quite comfortable. The housekeeping staff were wonderful as well. It's so nice to see the hotel open again and see the renovations. It's always been one of our favorites                    \"},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': \"Location is perfect! Close to everything and very walkable! Hotel was great! Friendly staff, great breakfast and rooms were nice! Would definitely recommend to friends and family! And will definitely stay here again!!!  This hotel is amazing! All staff members we were in contact with were professional, friendly and very helpful. The location is so close to Fisherman's Wharf so many things were within walking distance. The room was very clean with comfortable beds. There is a separate room for the toilet and shower that is small but caused us no issues. The relaxing electric fire pits were nice. One area is for smokers and 3 more for non-smokers with comfortable outdoor furniture surrounding them all. They have a heated pool which many were enjoying but with the temperatures and wind in SF the air was too chilly for us. The best reason to stay at SF Hotel Riu is the breakfast buffet!! They have lots of areas for seating and plenty of staff to clean tables and direct guests to open tables. The It is a 30 minute walk to Union Square. Clean, nice for meetings, good WiFi. The breakfast is fantastic. Overall, a good place to meet with others as well. I wil definitely think about the hotel then ext time I attend JPM. Great location, helpful staff and close to everything you might want to do in San Fran, walk to everything and public transport nearby. Rooms were clean and spacious, breakfast was hearty and the closeness to restaurants made getting dinner easy. Try to get a room that does not face the bus depot. I'll get the bad out of the way. The TV only got the basic cable channels, the pillows were much too soft and gooey and the bathroom was a touch on the small side. But that breakfast buffet MORE than made up for it! Located only a few blocks from the Fisherman's Wharf and all of it's beautiful touristy splendor, it was easy to get anywhere in the city from just outside the door, where lo and behold a streetcar station sat! We had a 5 night stay in this comfortable hotel. The bedroom was spacious and clean (king deluxe).  The public areas could have been anywhere in the world. Check in was fast and efficient. The drinks were expensive.  Breakfast was busy with a fairly limited menu and drinks were self serve. We had to queue most days but the queues went down quickly. The hotel was ideally placed to get our pre-booked ferry to Alcatraz, bus tour to Muir Wood, Salcilito and cable car trip. Also walking distance to Pier 39 to see the seals and a good selection of  restaurants nearby. We walked through the Tenderloin district by mistake (which we would not recommend!) and were glad to return to the Fisherman’s Wharf area. It is a well-located hotel near the Fisherman Wharf with absolutely great staff. The room was clean and well furnished and offered all we could need in our single-night stay before returning home to the UK. Great locations and a great place to stay. Very basic rooms but everything you need to have a relaxing night on your trip.  Breakfast was very busy and had to queue up for 15 mins on the one day, but food was great with a large selection.  Clean and safe.  This hotel was good, not great. The rooms are nice sized and kept clean. The included breakfast was very good. The lobby is spacious and nice.   But, There is no restaurant on site.  The lobby bar is not well stocked.  The hallways are kept at the same temperature as the outside, which was very cold when I was there.  The water pressure is very low.  The mattress and linens were average. Great location, so close to the wharf and the boats to Alcatraz. The room was fine and it's nice there is a parking garage underneath the hotel and across the street. The breakfast was very well organized but it did get very busy, get there early to avoid the long lines! Lovely hotel in a good spot, close to pier. Pleasantly surprised to find 2 x queens beds in our room. Loved the outdoor seating areas for a morning coffee. Decor lovely, great shower in bathroom and breakfast excellent, would recommend. Had a great time in SFO.  Location was awesome and the staff was so kind and helpful.  They always had a smile on their face and went out of their way to answer any questions.  The food selection was amazing, tasted very good and always stocked. Generally, hotel is huge, location is great just minute walk from the pier. Plentiful of food establishments around the hotel.   Staff are helpful and great bfast spread. Overall, no negative comments from the young & old folks we travel with!   A great place to stay !  First impression as you walk through reception is that it looks lovely.  Booked in and had to pay extra for damage to be refunded later. Went to room what a disappointment! Marks on bathroom walls, dull non inviting. Husband complained so apparently we got upgraded to balcony.  No… it over looks the bus station, constant noise from it. The balcony itself was dirty! Breakfast is a joke if you are not down there by 7.30 expect a long wait.  No evening meals being served even though they advertise it.  Cleaning staff are lovely and polite, the reception staff could learn a lesson from them.  Homeless will sit outside by the fires, there’s security but it looks like they cannot be bothered.  Booked this hotel, as my friend always books Rui hotels but she said this is not their usual This was the second time we have stayed at this Hotel Riu in the past year. Our son lives in the area, so it is a very convenient and comfortable place to stay. We definitely enjoy the breakfast buffet. Very good service by all staff. We stayed for a few days before Xmas and the hotel was exactly what it said, rooms comfy, spacious and clean and the breakfast was brilliant with lots of choice. Staff all friendly and helpful and positioned next to fisherman's wharf with a small walk to all the things to see I visited this hotel for Business Purposes. The service by all the staff members and crew was excellent. I suggest all people visiting this city must book this hotel without any query. Each and everything was up to the mark.  The location of this hotel was excellent - couple of minute walk from Fisherman's Wharf, Alcatraz ferry, two cable car start points, Ghiradelli, hop on hop off bus trips, Napa Valley / Sonoma wine tours. The staff, every one from front door through reception, breakfast buffet to room cleaners,  made our stay a pleasure: smiling, happy and helpful. Loved the outdoor fires that you could sit around at night (if you managed to get a seat as they were very popular). Not the cheapest hotel  I just wanted to take the time to say a big thank you to all the staff for a wonderful stay. Everyone was so efficient & nothing was too much trouble. Our party was extremely happy with the cleanliness of the rooms & how comfortable they were. I'd like to say a special thank you to Graciella (my apologies if I have spelled it incorrectly), the manager who addressed our complaint. She was so kind & able to offer suitable options to address the nuisance caused by another guest, and I am very appreciative of her skills.  The ladies in the Grab and Go in particular were wonderful. Always asking how we were & if we were enjoying our stay. The front desk staff & at the concierge/bell station were equally helpfully & kind, so thank you to you all, you do the hotel proud & they are This is a busy hotel at a reasonable price in a great location to Fisherman's wharf area. The free buffet breakfast is very good and pretty extensive. The rooms are nice and clean and the entire staff was courtesy, polite, helpful and positive. Highly recommend An absolute pleasure to stay at Riu - the front staff was amazing making our arrival perfect. The room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was delicious and plentiful. The location is perfect for walking to Pier 39 to grab food, sites or a coffee. All in all a 5* resort!!! Great location, hotel amenities, and comfort in the room! Breakfast was unreal and the lobby bar was an awesome place to unwind at the end of the day! Fantastic stay and will be back without a doubt! Can’t say enough good things about this property! It was a great stay and perfect location to everything we had going on.  The staff was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable of the area.  The breakfast was good with a great variety.  We enjoyed the bar in the hotel as well. Travelling with 3 small children this was a great place to stay. The hotel is modern and clean and in a great location. Only a short walk to Fishermans Wharf, Alcatraz Ferry Terminal and to the Trolley Car stations. The buffet breakfast has a huge selection and ensured we got the day off to a great start every day. Yes it does get busy at breakfast peak times but this is a large hotel catering for many people. Upon check in and in each of the elevators there is information about when the peak times for breakfast are. Its pretty simple, the information is there if you don't want to wait then don't go at peak time. We had no problems getting a seat on any of the days we ate breakfast here. The bar is also a well stocked bar where you can get a huge variety of drinks. There is also Took my brother to San Francisco for his birthday because he had never seen the city. Chose the Rui for it's convenient location to so many attractions. Was not disappointed. The hotel  and all it's staff ,made our trip very memorable This hotel was really nice!  It's very clean and employee staff were all courteous, pleasant, & eager to help.  We would definitely stay here again.  Also, it's location to Fisherman's Wharf was the ideal place to stay.   We picked this hotel based on proximity to the cruise port.  It was close to activities nearby and a very nice hotel.  The breakfast buffet was fantastic.  We took a harbor cruise and really enjoyed it.  I am recommending it to all my clients. As a regular RIU guest, this hotel did not disappoint. The hotel is located close to Fisherman's Wharf and is within easy reach of bars and restaurants. Breakfast's, not always included in other hotels, were substantial. The room was modern; clean and roomy. Would highly recommend. RIU Plaza FW has transformed this location into a boutique style hotel that feels intimate and quaint. Plenty of spaces to relax through-out the hotel. The hotel  ultilizes space well, you don't have that  crowded feeling even though there are lots  of guest around. The rooms and bathroom  are small but adequate and very  comfortable. Excellent service through out  hotel. The included breakfast buffet is the  best value of staying at RIU. Definately a  madhouse on weekends but worth it!  Highly recommend! The hotel is very comfortable with nicely equipped and furnished rooms, and is very conveniently located to Fisherman's Wharf. A big thank you to Quinn at Reception for a smooth check-in and room upgrade. The morning breakfast isn't what you'd call overly fancy but is more than adequate, and the kiosk next to the lobby is very handy for little purchases of essentials. The firepits outside the lobby are a nice place to sit with a drink in the evenings. The only thing preventing a 5-star rating for us was the heating unit in our room, which emitted a loud whooshing noise when it clicked on during the night (our kids could hear it from the adjoining room) whenever the temperature fell below the designated temperature. This tended to wake us up several times a night, so we were a                    \"},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': \"                    LOVE, LOVE LOVE this place! ❤️ Service, style & vibes were just outstanding!  Free sangria on arrivals was just what you want after travelling!  The location was perfect for exploring San Fran. Many places are in walking distance, short walk to BART. I really enjoyed the decor, and the rooms are spacious, with literally everything you need for a home away from home.(And if they don't have it in the room, don't worry the front desk will get it for you.). The front desk staff are amazing and go above and beyond to help you during your stay. (I would suggest not to recommend the Black Cat Jazz bar, very bad experience, and the neighborhood felt unsafe. Especially walking around.)  One of our favourite things was the onsite cafe, delicious coffee to wake up to, and tasty fresh food This place was affordable, clean, and comfortable. The kind staff were the cherry on top. This was one of the best boutique hotels I have ever stayed at. It's also right smack in the middle of all the San Francisco bustle so you can access the restaurants and all the amazing experiences the Bay offers. I definitely recommend this place for your next SF visit  Wow. It’s hard to write a review about this hotel. I’ve never stayed somewhere that just totally swept me way with such real hospitality and great vibes. Straight from the gate Mandy and Panda at the front desk were so adorable and hilarious. They made me feel like I knew them forever which is so crazy! They were so on point with everything they suggested to me and my crew, it literally made our trip. The amenities this hotel offers are so cool and they bring them straight to the room. The bartender Lordes was awesome and gave us the rundown on the hotels theme and story in such a capturing way we legit couldn’t stop asking questions after. We felt like spoiled kids. Would never book anywhere else in San Francisco after staying at Emblem. Can’t wait to come back! Loved the hotel - clean, quiet, great location! There were lots of fun concierge options, we took advantage of the essential oil defuser.   I had to work remotely while there - WiFi was good and it was easy to order from the coffee shop at the ground level. Mandy at the front desk was incredible and made sure that our wedding weekend was one we won't forget. The service from everyone was outstanding, and the room was extremely clean and comfortable. Chromecast on the TV so we could choose what we wanted to stream as well.  It was in a great location close to many places to eat and drink. Also close to a bus line and cable car. Did not use the extensive list of amenities, but the ones we did use were wonderful. Coffee shop attached to the hotel had delicious coffee—my husband spent every morning down there while I was still in bed. The bed was very comfortable and the room was very quiet. Luckily, we had air conditioning because it was a very warm week while we were there. The air conditioning sometimes was a little too cool, but better than no air conditioning at all.  The front desk staff were friendly, welcoming, and helpful.  The housekeeping was great—they did a terrific job cleaning our rooms. I would definitely recommend the Emblem to anyone visiting San Francisco! The whole team is what made our stay at this great hotel memorable - they make you feel heard if there's something to fix and they go the extra mile to make you feel welcome. They give you the biggest smiles, not forced ones, but real, which is a rarity to encounter these days. Thank you so much - especially to the GM Fungai, the DoR Tori as well as Panda and Irene.  We appreciate you so much!  The location of the hotel is ideal (safe, central), they provide bikes which is great (could be updated to more suitable ones for the hilly city ;-)), room was clean and the one we had had a lot of daylight which was great.  Definitely highly recommended and would return without a second thought!  Thank you again <3 My wife and I stayed at the Emblem for several nights in early October and we have nothing but superlatives to say.  The staff were all friendly, welcoming and helpful. The common areas, the bar and the rooms are all maintained very well. The atmosphere is relaxed and gave us the feeling of being at home away from home during our visit. And, the location is excellent, near Union Square, shopping, restaurants and transportation to everywhere in the city. We specifically want to thank Gitanjali Bhushan and Orion Denley at the front desk who were particularly attentive and responsive to some personal issues.  We recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a great experience in the center of San Fransisco. We plan to be back! We held a corporate Brand Launch Party with Hotel Emblem and were BLOWN AWAY by the level of care and detail they showed. Tony + the team were so helpful, proactive and everything went off without a hitch! They constantly thought of ways to make my life as the event organizer easier and were truly instrumental in helping us plan this event. The food was amazing, the venue was beautiful and the service was top notch. Highly recommend for an event. I ended up staying the night after our event and can testify that the comfort of the room was just as amazing. Thanks for a great evening that everyone was raving about! I popped in Hotel Emblem to meet a friend the other day and it was so very cool. Firstly, the vibe of this hotel is very chill, understated and comfortable. It has a bit of a bohemian flair, but the books in the lobby are what really got me excited. It was almost like wallpaper, but real. Not with spines out, but paper showing. I was told they’re actually all books related to San Francisco. The hotel digs deep into the literary history of of the city. It’s not a huge hotel, but they cram all of this cozy book vibe into the first floor. I loved it.   The bar is super cool, too. The video fireplace…of books burning…was a very nice touch. It was unlike any hotel bar I’ve ever been in. Again, the chill vibe really did it for me. Everyone was friendly, the bartender made great drinks                                        \"},\n",

Between the baseball stadium and Chase Center.  Clean, modern, spacious rooms.  The staff is very welcoming and friendly.  It is an easy, safe walk to the Embarcadero Great hotel.  Great rooms.  Great location.  Incredibly friendly staff.  I had a bad headache while checking in the an the woman at the front desk noticed and brought me a bottle of water and checked up on me later.  It was very nice.  Will stay here again the next time I'm up in SF. It was a quick stay with my husband, just one week after i stayed with a friend at Luma for the Queen concert at   Chase center. Both stays were nice, but valet parking is expensive and not sure surrounding lots are safe.  Friendly, engaged and efficient front desk and valet staff. Upgraded to fabulous corner room with sweeping views of SF and bay bridge. Fun and warm (!) rooftop bar serving creative cocktails to toast another Warriors win and historic game for Curry with the like minded fans.  Our second time staying at LUMA.  This hotel is now our hotel of choice in San Francisco.   Location is perfect for my family especially when we go to Chase Center to catch a Warriors game and or catch a SF Giants baseball game  This hotel is centrally located between Chase Center and Oracle Park! PERFECT!!!   But on this particular stay, after the Warriors game and a lost,  we went back to our hotel LUMA and hung out in the lobby for a bit and the treatment we received from the night crew specifically manager Ricky and his staff William,  James,  Roland and Aaron was THE BEST I've ever experienced in any hotel I've ever stayed at.   The guys made sure we were taken care of from opening the doors,  elevators,  constantly asking us if we needed anything,  to watching our safety Loved our stay at the Luma Hotel.  It is a great location near the UCSF Medical Area in Mission Bay and the surrounding neighborhood.    Loved walking around this area and felt very safe in this neighborhood!  We will definitely return to the hotel again! The hotel is absolutely beautiful. It’s so modern and clean. We could see the bay bridge from our room. I love the coffee robots. They are cute!  Now, about my “but…” There is no coffee available in the lobby or in the rooms. You have to wait until the coffee shop opens at 6am. The robots do not deliver until 6:30am, or after 3pm.  This is my only complaint about my stay. We early risers need our coffee! The staff is very friendly, courteous and professional. We met William, the night auditor. He’s is amazing. Very nice, and was so helpful with our questions about the city.  We stayed for 4 night. We were in town for the Queen + Adam Lambert concert. The venue, The Chase Center is within walking distance.  The neighborhood is clean and safe. A lot of public transport nearby.  Luma pretends that it is a full service, luxury hotel. In actuality, it is a limited service, Vertical Motel. In sharp contrast to the on-line references to a “restaurant,” during the three days I stayed in November 2023, there was none. The area is bereft of restaurants. For dinner, the only option in the area was a sports bar. The situation at breakfast was more bleak - there is no restaurant but for a coffee shop ten minutes away with a queue in and outside the building. The next alternative was a food truck (also with a queue, though shorter).  The ”coffee shop” in the hotel largely sells shelf-stable pastries like muffins. There is nothing fresh – nothing with ham, cheese, tomatoes, cream cheese or even butter that can’t be stored overnight in a closet. I ordered a This hotel is a 10 out of 10 !!! Absolutely amazing !!!  Great hotel great location, staff is amazing the amenities are spectacular !  Order room service and a robot will deliver.  Great location too !!!    This was our first time staying at the LUMA Hotel. Everything was great!  The rooms were very clean and comfortable and the staff was super friendly. We will definitely stay there again and recommend to friends. \"},\n",

It's reasonably priced, in a good location, the staff were friendly and the room was exactly as expected - a little small, but perfectly functional and absolutely no complaints.  I'm not sure I would choose it in the summer as there isn't any air conditioning, but for us in May, it was perfect We stayed in this hotel for 6 nights and since we arrived until the day we left, we felt it as our true home. The hotel is very nice and has a privileged location in front of Union Square  All the people who works there, always tried to help us with a smile, giving us goods tips to visit the city. Every day before going out to explore the city or when returning from a tour, we had fresh lemonade, coffee, tea, delicious cookies and some nights even pop. This is the place to stay in our next visit to SF and we recommend it highly Our best regards to all the people who works there from Uruguai Stayed here on a business trip and it was good. Good location. Nice, clean room that’s been maintained well. Not very modern but very charming and well kept. Good housekeeping, wifi, excellent water pressure. Walls are a bit thin but not terrible. Staff were always so helpful and nice. Love the complimentary cookies and coffee from a warm, welcoming lobby. There’s always people at the bar in the early evening having a good time. Great choice for a comfortable stay and so close to everything so it’s very convenient. Excellent location, nice quiet room.  Beds are super comfy! Check in was simple, bell hop was very helpful.  Cute boutique hotel.  Would definitely stay here again.    Special shout out to Alicia in the bar who was excellent! I hurried back to have a drink just to see her on my last night! I stayed here with my family for two weeks. The hotel was beautiful, very quaint with extremely helpful staff. The rooms were very large, we had a nice view of Macy's from our window. There was free tea/coffe/water and cookies/popcorn available every day for the guests. The lobby was a lovely place to sit and relax, make new friends and listen to the hustle and bustle of the hotel. The staff behind the desk were amazing, super friendly and helpful with any questions. Especially with my Gran who is deaf and lost sight. Jerry the bellman was extremely friendly and helpful during our stay, especially helping us at the end of our holiday with  the bags and taxi. Ceri Badge We stayed here Sunday night, June 11, 2023. We had tickets at The Masonic for Ringo Starr and thought it would be nice to spend the night rather than leaving the concert early to get on BART to get home. It was a smart move as it was just a 10 minute walk back to the hotel. We arrived at the hotel around 2:00 and we were able to check in. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The room was bigger than we expected. The view was just of the rooftop, but we had it as a credit through Booking.com, and we weren't planning on hanging out in the room, so we didn't try to change. The room was quiet and comfortable. The bathroom had everything you could want and there was a little refrigerator in the room. Coffee and tea were available around the clock. There was a little bar across the Fabulous gem of a hotel with marvellous period detail. A pleasant surprise was that it is a family run business, a refreshing change from all the corporate chains that lack that personal touch. The staff were all lovely, the bar was welcoming and a nice way to relax before retiring to our rooms.  The rooms were perfect and quiet. Although small, they have everything you could need (bath, wifi, desk, decent TV, and cosy chair with footrest). Location couldn't be better. I also appreciated the free fruit, cookies, and water station. Highly recommend! Brilliant location, lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance. We even walked to Fishermans Wharf which took about 30 minutes! Hotel was a really good base to explore the city. Very clean and bed was so comfortable. Tea, coffee, popcorn and cookies were a brilliant gesture. Excellent hotel for the price. Hotel is located right beside Union square which is handy for getting around San Francisco. The hop on hop off bus, vintage street car and buses all near by or a 35 min walk to fisherman’s wharf.   The staff in the hotel were professional and friendly and gave us recommendations when asked for restaurants.   As other reviewers have written the free cookies, tea, coffee and popcorn is awesome. Mum and I stayed here at the start and end of our vacation and an evening cookie and cup of tea was most welcome. I highly recommend the Chancellor Hotel in San Francisco. The staff, Jem and Vivian, were very kind and they gave US some suggestions on the city tours and bus services. The room was comfortable and clean. The coffee, tea, water and biscuits at the lobby are very appreciated. The hotel's location is perfect for exploring San Francisco by foot. The combination of great service, comfortable accommodation, and reasonable prices make it an excellent choice for anyone visiting the city. I will recommend this hotel to anyone would visit SF.  The location is awesome and close to many transport links like BART, bus stops, even the cable car! The staff was really nice and the rooms were clean. I want to thank Shirley especially for her great assistance. I loved the tea/coffee/water service. They took my suitcases while checking out so I can see more of the city.  The staff was super friendly and helpful, loved the location, so many shops and places around. Great place to stay if you wanna know the city, just a few blocks from the subway station, and chinatown. The room was clean and comfortable. Overall lt was a great experience. Glen and Moni were very nice and helpful Very nice clean central hotel .with nice complimentary cookies and coffee  Still waiting to get back my security deposit but maybe that has to do with the bank Lovely hotel with lots of character. Perfect location for Union Square and cable car. Room spacious and clean. Good shower and plenty of hot water. Helpful staff and enjoyed Happy Hour! Complimentary cookies, popcorn, water, coffee and tea. Definitely recommend.  We really enjoyed our stay at the Chancellor Hotel. It was very comfortable for our family (with 2 young children). The hotel is located in a perfect area for tourists, right next to Union square, with plenty of convenient public transport options available.  The bar downstairs was also very nice, and we had easy access to plenty of food options in the area.  Free tea/coffee/water and biscuits in the lobby was a nice touch.   We were very happy with our stay here Very well located, right on the cable car line and close to bottom of Powell Street.  Quite atmospheric and dated but in a good way, room was very pleasant, clean today, spacious,  hot and cold drink facilities in the reception, service good.  No complaints. Would stay there again. Me and my 2 daughters had a beautiful time at the hotel, the staff were very nice and helpful especially Zina.  The beds and pillows were very confortable. We LOVED our stay and would most definitely stay here again.  Grazie  I highly recommend the Chancellor Hotel in San Francisco. The staff, including Joan, Shirley, Jem, David, Zina, and Linda, provided exceptional customer service during my two-week stay, ensuring we kept our room without having to change. The room was comfortable, clean, and had a great city view. The hotel's location is perfect for exploring San Francisco by foot. The combination of great service, comfortable accommodation, and reasonable prices make it an excellent choice for anyone visiting the city. I look forward to returning to the Chancellor Hotel and experiencing the exceptional service once again. The Chancellor Hotel is a cut above the rest in my books. Beautiful decor, rooms are spacious and clean with comfy beds. All staff are friendly and professional. This Hotel offers you more than the standard hotel with complimentary 24/7 coffe/tea, freshly baked cookies, bowl of fruit and iced lemon infused water available in the lobby where there is a spacious lounge area and bar. Most of all, We enjoyed after a full day of touring around, coming back to the hotel bar for happy hour to unwind and chat with the bar attendant Alicia and Rory. Both Alicia and Rory were fun and engaging and both with a wealth of knowledge of Sanfrancisco and surrounding areas. The Chancellor Hotel is in a prime position opposite Union Square and in close walking access to cable cars, Powell St. I was traveling for work and was looking for a convenient location in Union Square.  I read the reviews and this hotel stood out because of the friendly service of the hotel staff.  The second I met Alicia behind the bar, I knew I made the right choice.  She is so friendly and  welcoming to every guest, and she easily made my long days so much better.  I honestly think when I return to the East Coast I will miss her.  Other perks in this hotel besides the location is the free lemon water, coffee, cookies, apples and popcorn in the lobby.  Rooms are smaller than your large hotels but there was more than enough room especially for one person, and the bed was comfy and the water pressure was strong and hot!  Stay here you will not be upset and make sure you share a drink and a\"},\n",

Was able to hop on any public transportation necessary to visit all the city pass attractions.  The Hyatt Regency is one of the best hotels in San Francisco due to its waterfront location while still being in downtown and across from the Embarcadero and pier. It has a great Regency club at the rooftop with a great view. The food was good, but it kept coming out in small batches. I love the architecture of this hotel. It never gets old to me. I love the atrium, and the elevators.  Good location, our room (high club floor) had views of the bay and Alcatraz as well as the downtown area.  Checkin was great, loved the pillows, room smaller than others, (however view made up for it).  Housekeeping a little tardy (returned to room 3pm and not made up).  Starbucks coffee machine (not that great).  Small bathroom (reasonable shower pressure) and hot water not that hot.  TV monstrous (desk space over TV preferred for us).  Good capacity to use multiple chargers for tech.  Concierge was helpful.  Would revisit. The hotel is located on the side of Endorero Station, which you can connect to directly from the SFO airport and use other transportation modes throughout the city of San Francisco.  Bay View, for more cost, may not be useful because it affects neighborhood buildings. Paying higher price for the best view of the Bay is in Suite.  My family love fruits and the Hotel Restaurant served the best fresh fruits everyday!!! It could be pricey but for us it\\'s worth it.  We are out for most part of the day on Tours, exploring the city so we\\'re not sure if Lunch and Dinner are great, im sure they are.  Room was very spacious with a comfortable king size bed, sofabed and coffee table. There was a coffee machine, a safe and good storage for clothes. Room temperature was easily adjusted and the room was very quiet with no noise from inside or out. The bathroom was large and well appointed with good quality toiletries. The shower temperaure could have been warmer on occasions. Housekeeping was thorough but erratic, possibly due to being Holiday time. Front desk staff and bell hops were extremely helpful when our baggage was delayed by the airline. Breakfast had a great variety of hot and cold items on offer, including make your own waffles, and as much tea or coffee as you wanted. Dinner service was sometimes a little slow but food was always tasty. The foyer was beatifully Pro: Location is convenient, clean rooms, gym is large, clean and well-maintained, valet parking is very convenient but expensive.  Con: Personally I don’t like the design of the hotel, the lobby is too dark and seems old-fashioned, however, the hotel rooms and gym are clean and modern. Dining options are very limited. There’s a food market for snacks and beverages and a bar on site with very limited menu. No in-room meal service. They also don’t provide bottles of water in the room, which is very annoying. Water is sold at the food market but over-priced.  Booked this hotel weeks in advance for a bay view balcony room and even called in to speak with their staff to confirm that this is the room to book to watch fireworks from.  Upon arrival it takes almost an hour to get my  car in valet - that should have been the first bad sign. Then when I got checked in around 5pm there was still a half hour wait to get in my room saying it still needed to be cleaned (seconds bad sign - it was probably vacated from a disgruntled guest). When we got to the room we were disappointed it was only a partial bay view, and when the fireworks started we could t see a thing.   Even though we confirmed with their staff it would be for the show, they lied just to close the deal. The view was not one of the ones you see online with the Golden gate bridge Great staff, property, location and value. Trust me, you can\\'t go wrong with booking this hotel. Keep in mind, other than a buffet breakfast and a To Go Market, you will have to venture out to eat, which to me was a plus. So many things close by. Take the historic train cars to Pier 39 and enjoy the food and sites. Wonderful stay. Awesome room with incredible views. Friendly staff. Incredible location. But...you need to offer room service. For $700 a night, you need to offer room service and a bit better dining options. Breakfast buffet was not worth the price for what was offered. Other than dining an amazing experience! The hotel is in a great location, is clean and modern, and great staff.  I had an issue with loud music coming from the room beside me at 2:30 in the morning, and security handled the issue.  The manager, Elaine, made a point of reaching out to me once she found out there was an issue, to see if there was anything she could assist with, which was unexpected but very much appreciated. We originally booked at the Meridian, which is apparently undergoing a chaotic transition — and the Hyatt was an absolute pleasure to deal with after canceling at the Meridian. Easy check-in, lovely, updated room, responsive and professional staff, fantastic location across from the Ferry Building. Will definitely stay here again. I haven\\'t stayed at the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero for quite some time. And I must say I am impressed with the recent changes.   The lobby bar and restaurant has been thoroughly refreshed. It feels very intimate despite being in the middle of the cavernous lobby/atrium. The atrium itself now has lots of wooden benches, sofas, and plugs for charging.  Which makes the space feel far more cozy than before.  In-room renovations have likewise created a comfortable environment you might want to linger in. With high quality carpets, clean bathrooms, and artwork to soften up the grey concrete that the hotel used to be known for. Service was great as well. From the warm welcome at check-in to housekeeping actually paying attention to notices. And everything in between. Recent experiences We stay at the Hyatt - Embarcadero most always when we visit SF. We luge luxuries of a higher end hotel and the Hyatt does not disappoint. From the Club Level access to the large suite, our weekend stay was comfortable and enjoyable. Hotel/staff good. Surrounding area horrible. Noise all night police activities till 4am. Like the rest of Downtown, gone to crap. Do not get a room on the Market St. side. Every noise, police activity, and vagrant is on that side. This was a great visit at the Hyatt Regency this time.  Staff were friendly, the check in process was super easy and our front desk staff accommodated our requests, the connectivity of the Embarcadero property to the surrounding elements of downtown SF were pretty convenient, the gym was nice and easily accessible and the Bacon Cheddar Scones down at the market were yummy!   Partial bay view was OK.  Lack of room service other than snacks a disappointment.  Hotel staff were all excellent bordering on outstanding.  We had the two room, 1 1/2 bath suite and the room was fantastic.  exceptionally clean and very roomy. Location is great, near restaurants, pharmacy, stores and the subway. Installation is great as well, big room, brand new bathroom and luggage storage. I had a problem with an incorrect change that no one could solve by the way.  A great looking Hotel with very nice rooms.  The breakfast albeit pricey was terrific.  The hotel is located in a relatively safe part of SF - just off of downtown.  Plenty of restaurants within walking distance.  If you want to save a few bucks on parking, park at the Embarcadero 3. Overall it was a beautiful hotel and all of my employees enjoyed their stay, with that being said I was disappointed with the lack of urgency to accommodate us getting our reserved suite, the manager telling us they were sold out of suites for the evening, but when proof of  reservation for a suite was shown they were able to \"move things around\" but still would not had been able to get us into a suite until 3 hours later which by that time we needed to eb at our company party.

No view but huge room with a balcony and fold out sleeper sofa. Thanks @regina! The TV is the only annoying thing. What channels DO we get?? Great hotel, location and price.  I needed to spend a weekend in San Francisco for work and this allowed both work and due to it's great location some play.  Thank you to Regina at the front desk for making sure I was comfortable.   This hotel has it all. It's very close to the Embarcadero and the ferry building, Perry's restaurant (located in the same building) is excellent, and the hotel staff is so friendly. Thank you Brandon for helping me several times. I called two different times before arriving to make requests and he was very helpful and friendly.   The executive suite is a dreamy room with a great patio outfitted with a table, two chairs, and a loveseat. All the cushions were missing when we got up to the room and I called on Brandon again for help. He had cushions sent up almost instantly.   I love this hotel and will return. With Brandon at the front desk, my stay was even better knowing that I had someone who was attentive and  thorough should anything be needed.  Great hotel in an incredible area.  The views of the bridge from the rooms is spectacular.  Perry's has great food and a big bar.  Most of the staff are very nice and Brandon helped make our trip extra special.  It is a must stay location for the views alone. I booked this hotel through Priceline and had quite an interesting experience (in a good way!). Read On.  First off, shout out to Brandon at the front desk for helping me through the process of getting settled in. Upon entering, I was greeted by him and he was friendly, professional and very accommodating. Checking in was a breeze and I asked Brandon if there was a fridge. He said to check the room and if there wasn't one, I could borrow one by calling back down. Bet, as the kids say.  I went up to the room, checked out the layout. It seemed clean and recently updated. I turned on the TV and no signal. I called down to tell Brandon about the fridge and lack of TV source. He came up to check it out and gave me keys to another room and then said to check for a fridge there.  I This is the perfect spot for a quick one night trip to SF. The location is great and the front desk staff, Regina and Darius are very friendly and accommodating! Great impressions from the first steps into the hotel.  Regina at the front desk was super helpful and accommodating during our short stay and early morning departure over the Thanksgiving holiday. Just another charm of this charming hotel. I’ll be back, for sure Great location and cute small historic boutique hotel. Big shout out to Diana at the front desk for being super professional and helping make my stay very comfortable.  Nice little coffee spread in the morning and loved access to ymca next door.  Hotel Griffon charges daily amenity fees which are not included in online advertising. The 4pm check in time was a major surprise. Cleaning crew did not arrive until 5pm Saturday evening which was too late. Maintenance/construction crew was drilling into later afternoon Came to hotel Griffon and REGINA  was awesome very attentive and warming made the check in experience great would definitely recommend 10/10 …..if your in the Bay Area stop by Perry’s is a great place to eat as well I throughly enjoyed my stay at hotel griffin! I travel a few times a year for work and this was by far the most comfortable stay iv had - they upgraded me to the bay room suite and I had fantastic views outside my window and was lucky enough to catch the fireworks show one evening.  It’s a cute Boutique hotel, felt like a comfortable home away from home, and so convenient with Perry’s restaurant just downstairs.  Brandon and Darius are a fantastic team working the front desk - were able to answer all the questions I had and were friendly and truly put customer service first. What a pleasure! Charming boutique hotel, my view was stunning, I didnt want to leave my room. Perfect for 1-2 travelers , tight for any kids. European flare, high end furniture, beautiful BR. Yum pastries and coffee/tea in am. Service 5 stars, Darius and Regina were wonderful the whole stay.  lucky to be under 150 a night!  Hotel Griffon is located at a great location, right along the pier and has a great view. Very walkable to many places and bars, also Perry's is great.  I would like to share my experience with Hotel Griffon here: My husband and I got married in September. We decided to stay for our first night and  also booked rooms for the families. Regina and Brandon took care of all the reservations and any amenities that we needed for the stay. We had two little babies, and parents who needed accessibility. They were very helpful and get things needed very fast. We all know the wedding can be stressful, especially when you don't have a wedding planner and have to do everything on your own. But all the staff were very welcoming, understood the situation that needed early check-ins, late This is such a beautiful boutique hotel!!!  It is literally right across the street from the ferry so it is super convenient, and it allows you a magnificent view of the new Bay Bridge with all of its twinkle night lights!  We took the ferry in from Vallejo/Napa and were checked into our room 5 minutes after we walked off the ferry!  We have stayed here several times, and the towels, robes, and bed linens are spectacular!!!  The bed was spotlessly white, bright, clean and fresh with brand new fluffy pillows for a perfect rest, and the shower was stocked with expensive Italian shampoo, conditioner, and body soap.  The towels were thick, plush and appeared brand new as well.  We had a perfect stay from the moment the lovely and warm Oliva checked us in until the delightful, kind, My husband and I traveled to SF from San Jose for Halloweekend to go on a Boat Party Cruise. This hotel was so close to the Ferry Building and Pier 3. Clean hotel, friendly staff and overall a wonderful stay!  We were greeted with an unexpected upgrade to a king room with a view. Location was terrific as were the morning pastries and coffee service. We definitely would stay at the Hotel Griffon again when visiting San Francisco.  The Griffon is in a location…on the Embarcadero. Perry’s restaurant is on site and excellent. The staff is professional and helpful. Some rooms are small but well priced. Choose a room facing the Bay for a welcoming view. Loved  my stay at this hotel. It was near everything I needed to do in San F and the view  of the  ocean and iconic Bay Bridge was spectacular  . The rooms have no microwave or fridge and are abit  small though but enough for a solo stay. The staff were friendly and the restaurant  served amazing food.   This is our second stay here. As prior ST residents, it’s now our go-to place when we visit. We love the location, the staff is friendly and personable - Regina greeted us with so much warmth and welcome, it made us feel special. The rooms are super clean and comfortable with that touch of fancy that a nice bathrobe conveys!  Highly recommended! Regina was an excellent welling presence when we arrived answering all our questions and being very helpful. The suite was clean and well appointed. It was upgraded for us without our having to ask. The pastries and morn8ng coffee were greatly appreciated as well. Property is a bit worn out in a charming way (bed too soft) but location and staff are great. Nice walk to the Embarcadero, Rincon Park and Ferry Building, which has good food). Price was also good. Would go back. The hotel was perfect for our stay. We came up  just for the night for a concert. The room was very clean and the view of the Bay spectacular. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and made check in a positive and easy experience. They upgraded our room feom City view to Bay view. Hospitality. It's hard to find these days. There's nothing quite like pulling into town and being welcomed by someone who is genuinely happy to see you and then performs her job with exemplary wisdom and kindness. Regina at the front desk made sure our room was to our liking and that we had everything we needed to launch our trip to make our wedding plans. Thank you so much, Regina. We loved the location and the restaurant was excellent for a late night drink and for a casual dinner. The room was clean and functional. Our only issue was a stopped toilet, which we did not cause, and there was no one available to address it until the next day. Other than that, perfect place to stay, and we plan to return.  A special thanks to Ann and Regina for the complimentary upgrade and bottle of Sauvignon Blanc! We loved the view of San Francisco Bay Bridge! We highly recommend walking over to the farmers market at the Ferry Building on Saturday morning! I can’t say enough about Brandon at the front desk. He was so awesome! I had been in Northern California for the week and had a personal emergency and needed a place to stay for the night. I was super lucky there was still a room available for my last minute reservation. I had been up since 4am and when I arrived to the hotel in the afternoon, I was greeted by Brandon. He was so friendly, but when I told him about the issue I was having and that I was working on getting an earlier flight home, he showed me such kindness and compassion. He really put me at ease and made me feel safe and cared for, which meant so much to me and that was exactly what I needed at that moment. I don’t think I even really knew that’s what I needed..but Brandon knew. I can’t thank him and the hotel Loved the location for walking to Oracle Park, Ferry building, Alcatraz tour.   Lots of history and the rooms retained some of the old city feel.   The food at Perrys and bar below were great and ultra convenient.   Pastrys and coffee started us off perfectly each day.  I would rate more of 2.5. I stayed at Hotel Griffon for a work event and was drawn in by the pictures and hotel location.  Word of advice to anyone looking at pictures, things are not always as they seem.  The location was close to the Embarcadero and Ferry Building with a view of the bay, however, my room viewed a brick wall. The lighting was either very bright or dark, no in between.  with the window facing a wall, there was very little natural light.  The room was stuffy, the AC was on the lowest setting but still didn't cool the room very well.    I was prepared for the room to be small, however, I did not expect how small it actually was.  No desk or work area, the bed took up most of the room.  The area around the hotel was iffy.  Lots of homeless people around and This hotel is excellent. We had a beautiful King Room with a beautiful view of the Bay. Very clean. We loved the staff. Brandon and Regina were very helpful and polite. In the morning before we left, we had delicious pastry and just brewed coffee. Highly recommendable. We will be back Brandon and Diana went above and beyond.  Outstanding customer service. The location was fantastic, just steps away from the piers and lots of great restaurant options.  The hop on hop off bus stop was nearby as well.\"},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': '                    Okay - so probably would not recommend this hotel, but it certainly isn’t as bad as some of the reviews.  We booked ages ago because of its location to BART and the Symphony Hall.  Then, we read the reviews the day before we were going (I know - stupid!) We were rather nervous about staying there, but of course it was too late to cancel.  The area is a tad sketchy, but not scary.  We walked back from the symphony and there was not one homeless person on the street by the hotel.  The rooms were sparse, somewhat clean and overall acceptable.  There is no breakfast (even though I think they advertised one) and only 1 out of 4 elevators works… we waited 5 minutes for an open elevator.  Had extra amenities fee???  Not sure what that charge was for… but I think it’s called “nickel and Worst hotel I have ever been in , deceived on website, not treated properly by staff just plain striped bare room , bad room, elevator was whacked what more do you want to hear? A plain old rotten experience and crappy service The staff was friendly and the manager was sweet, but the concierge, experience and facilities were lacking in every area. Elevators are broken, we did over 30 minutes for towels that never came? The resort fee is a joke because I never even got the yoga mat to use. I had the ceiling dripping on me in the bathroom because the phone was broken and the rooms were quite budget. I would NEVER stay here again. The headache alone. Never again. It smelled, I asked for a refund and since they ruined New Year’s Eve for me and I couldn’t get get free parking which was $55 a night Convenient and safe as it\\'s ocated near the the center of the city with a gated indoor parking garage. Guestroom is big and bright with an awesome city view. The pillows are soft and the mattress is very supportive. Definitely will come back again. I really enjoyed our stay at SF because of its convenient location. The hotel staff were really helpful and polite. The room we stayed in was very clean which made me and my family relax after a long tiring day.  I called & spoke to Luis - needed a parking receipt. He emailed it to me & stayed on the line. It didn\\'t come, so he used his own work email, resent it, and stayed on until I confirmed it arrived. TY  Like my last stay here, I was not disappointed with the service. The staffs are nice and approachable. Also, the bed and pillows are so comfy that I rest really well. The room, washroom and everything are all clean.  Overall, I enjoyed my stay here. 5/5 for me. The staff was incredibly helpful and the room was wonderful and clean. The amenities were great! The location is nice and near to good restaurants and places, the hotel exceeded my expectations. Overall, I have an awesome stay! will definitely book with them again!  The rooms are bare bones basic. The carpet is dirty and super stained. My shower drain was clogged the entire stay. With the standard room you have no table to sit at or a mini fridge. The cleaners were really nice and helpful but the front staff could be hit or miss.  When I checked out they wouldn\\'t put my bags in the storage room but in an unlocked room that anyone could walk into. I asked to put it into the locked storage room but the staff member still refused and was very rude.  The hotel is located deep in the homelessness area and you will see people taking drugs and passed out just outside the entrance. It is not a safe area at night. I will not stay here again. Celebrated our 5th anniversary in here! Such lovely and relaxing place. We had a great time together, and we just enjoyed the serenity. The whole place is so neat and well maintained. Kudos to the accommodating staff as well! First time to stay here and it exceeds my expectations. They have excellent customer service and comfortable room to stay in. The location was convenient for us and the streets were clean. It is a great place to stay. The place is well maintained and clean. The staffs are very accommodating and helpful. The sheets are clean and the food is good as expected. I would love to bring my family and friends on my next visit.  The staff made our stay incredibly comfortable. The room was a highlight too, all clean and modern with everything you need. And the neighborhood? Spotlessly clean and felt totally safe. If you\\'re heading to San Francisco, definitely consider BEI. It\\'s a fantastic choice! I recently had the pleasure of staying at BEI hotel, and overall, it was a delightful experience. The hotel boasts a prime location with stunning views and offers a range of amenities that make it a great choice for both business and leisure travelers. The clean was neat and clean. Pillows and bedsheets are well washed off. Streets are clean and they do have a nice neighborhood. Customer service was excellent, and they had a fantastic location in San Francisco. ✔️ The neighborhood is great, ensuring a safe stay. ✔️ Staff\\'s service is excellent. ✔️ The room provides a clean, comfy haven. ✔️ Hotel\\'s convenient location made accessing attractions easy.  BEI San Francisco is a solid choice! We spent our family vacation here last Thanksgiving since it\\'s a convenient location and the service is really great! The room is neat and very refreshing which we really appreciate and very well recommended. We will definitely go back here! :) I like that the street is clean and the neighborhood has improved when compared to my last visit. I feel more safe now and I like how the staff has treated me. They are very accommodating as always. This is what I like here the most plus the fact that its location is really near to all my errands. Yolanda is really good at the registration/ front desk. She can multitask very well and always with a positive attitude towards any questions or concerns. Her smile lights the day of anyone.  The rooms are very nice  The room was spacious and elegantly decorated. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, and the in-room amenities provided everything I needed for a relaxing stay. .This is a perfect place to unwind. .. I am in a wheelchair full-time, so I need an accessible bathroom. They advertise accessibility, but I have had better accessibility in places and didn’t advertise it. Every hotel should have grab rails in the showers and around the toilet, but especially in an accessible room. This room had no grab rails anywhere. My son was asked to leave the seating And view area next door window because people were complaining about him sitting there making no noise and not bothering anybody. Because the employees are on strike, there was constant noise that could be heard everywhere in the hotel. Frankly I’m disappointed with this Hôtel experience. The Good:  1. The staff, for the most part, were so friendly  2. The room was clean but super minimal. Comfortable bed.  The Bad:  1. The $35 per night “amenity fee” was not included in the “fees” portion I prepaid, which doesn’t make sense.  I would understand if this offered a bunch of things to guests, like a sauna or pool, but they don’t have much.  2. Location - while I’m sure the landscape has changed because of COVID, the mental health/homeless/drug problem is out of control in SF.  This location, while centrally located, seems to be smack dab in the middle of this crisis.  Walking around, especially at night, doesn’t feel very safe.  As a larger guy, I was hesitant, but if I were female, I would be afraid.   3. This is small, but the ice machine in the hall made a lot of Delightful stay! From the warm welcome to the cozy rooms, every moment was filled with genuine hospitality. The staff\\'s kindness and attention to detail made this visit truly special. Grateful for the wonderful memories created. Highly recommend! This hotel is a public nuisance due to the employees\\' union constantly striking with bullhorns out front.  There are 2000 residential apartments across the street at Trinity Place, the residents of which have to listen to them screaming through their bullhorns, as well as listen to drivers honking in support. Accordingly, I would characterize it as a mental health hazard for anyone who has to live and / or work on this block. While I empathize with the plight of these workers, after months and months of strikes, I would advise them to face reality and find new employment where they are treated fairly. Convenient location, affordable price, minimalistic, good beds and bathroom, modern, that about sums it up on the pro\\'s. Expect to pay half of your overnight just for your car, on top, for parking. Don\\'t expect the coffee machine to work. Don\\'t expect two chairs to sit on (just one). No desk to work on. Cords hanging below the shallow shelf. There is no happy hour as the bar has been closed long time ago, don\\'t go in the weekend if you want to feel like your lost in no-mansland, and don\\'t expect atmosphere, except if you want to count security agents in that category. All in all, yes, can see how it might work for some in terms of business purpose, but not exactly  for an outing in the City. My previous experience with friends from this hotel left me \"I will certainly come back!\" vibe which I really did but this time, with family and they really loved it! From the friendly and accomodating staffs to the clean and inviting rooms, not to metion, the affordable rate. This is indeed a very decent experience for a short break with my loved ones! I must say, we\\'ll come back again and let others experience as well this satisfying service the hotel has to offer! We were here the same month as last year and I can say that they still give the best service ever. Staffs are very welcoming and accommodating. The hotel has conference and meeting rooms with complete facilities and that makes our group discussions even more effective. The area is close to a lot of tourist destinations so we were able to unwind after work. I\\'d say it again - definitely, a 5/5 when you want to do business + leisure on the side! Hope they continue providing quality service.  Overall very satisfied, especially with the added safety features of parking, security guards and use if key in the elevator.   Loved our high floor room.  Room quiet, spacious, great view and comfortable.  The hotel was conveniently located, room was clean and secure, coffee shop had a nice selection, and the staff was friendly and helpful. We felt comfortable and enjoyed being able to easily take Uber, etc to the event. I would recommend this property for families! This is my second-time staying in to this awesome hotel as I was very satisfied with my first stay when I had my first solo trip here in SF. I have been gatekeeping this place to myself but lately, my friends were able to enjoy their stay here as well as I cannot help recommending this. '},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': \"                    Convenient location. Fisherman's Wharf is perfect for families and all the tours. If you aren't travelling with children Columbus is a great street to walk down, lots of great restaurants and bars. Our room was clean, all the staff were very accommodating and pleasant to deal with. Hotel Caza has bikes to hire which we did and it was very easy to cycle - traffic respectful.  A big thank you in particular to Vanessa M and the barman AL. Great location, convenient to tourist sites and transportation to downtown (cable car, streetcar). Very friendly staff. I don't have anything more to say, but since I have to hit a 200-character minimum, you're stuck with this last sentence. The hotel is… okay. I’m a little disappointed overall. First, I booked a partial ocean view, but from the room you can’t see a single HINT of the ocean - not even a speck. In fact, we are directly over an extremely loud intersection, which is why we booked the ocean view in the first place - to get away from the noise.   Second, the road noise is constant, and it goes all night long - there are very loud bangs at random times that kept waking us all up, like a garbage truck or something, and their windows are not the least bit soundproof.   Third, their morning offerings are disappointing, both paid and free. Coffee is absolutely awful, don’t even bother.   The beds are comfortable, but the pillows are so flat - not comfortable or supportive at all.   Overall, I would not stay We love Hotel Caza! Such an inviting home away from home! Friendly, helpful people - Vanessa M, AiaA were top notch! Helpful and knowledgeable. Al runs the bar in a welcoming Cheers atmosphere - even though patrons change daily. Newly renovated, tastefully designed. A winner! What pleasant surprise!  From the time I made the reservation - called multiple times - I received great service.  The rooms were clean, quiet, and comfortable.  Hotel is located close to Fisherman’s Wharf. Hotel has a great atmosphere - welcoming - not stuffy.  Staff was great.  Shout out to Al, the bartender.  We asked for speciality drinks that he cheerfully looked up and made. And made them so good that we had to go back the next night for more.  I’ll definitely be back for a longer stay. Amazing hotel & location. Staff are friendly & helpful, amenities at hotel are fantastic. Been travelling US for two months and can honestly say this has been the best hotel we’ve stayed at. Would definitely stay again.  Reasonably priced at a good location. Close to two stations of cable cars. I could choose either station to commute to the Moscone center for my conferences.  Room condition was very good, just that the option for breakfast is somewhat limited. Staff was dishonest about additional charges and what they promosed twice, at check in and out, would be a refundable deposit, was only partly refunded. No email contact about this since. Noisy AC, room got cold extremely fast and the heater was very loud.  Avoid, at all cost. Your safety is more important and the location is good to fisherman wharf but you can't be out a night. The customer service sucks. They were given 2 days notice we were leaving early and still charged me. Go somewhere else.save yourself the grief.  All staff were friendly polite and professional during our stay.  Unfortunately communication after your stay is inadequate. No reply to emails regarding money not being returned from room deposit! Not satisfied at all It's hard to find a hotel near the water in SF that we truly like. Hotel Caza was an excellent choice. Awesome staff, great parking that didn't break the bank, clean rooms, games in the lobby like pool and shuffleboard, bikes to use, all around awesome place. Caza is like hanging out with the cool kids in the neighborhood that truly enjoy what they do. Location is a 10, staff is a 10, definitely returning.  Cool place and location. Very easy access to the Wharf and Embarcadero, and within walking distance of lots of excellent food and drink options -- I personally was partial to areas in/around Chinatown and never had to call an Uber. The staff were friendly and had great advice re: things to do and places to visit. The bar was also a nice surprise and perfect for a nightcap after long days; Al in particular made some real top-notch Old Fashioneds and Manhattans and was great to chat with. Wonderful clean hotel with friendly staff. We were assisted by Aia, and they were incredibly helpful and friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone spending time in San Francisco. One of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. Thank you Aia! The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Al was a delight, very informative of the area and super nice and helpful.   The area was very safe, in super close distance to Pier 39, the cable cars and ferries to Alcatraz and Sausalito. Definitely recommend!!  Customer Service was top notch. The staff are all super friendly and accommodating. My team and I stayed there for almost two weeks and felt totally at home.   The highlight of our day was seeing Al at the bar, great cocktails, wonderful conversation and just an amazing human being.  This is the second time we stayed at Hotel Caza but my first time meeting Al.  Great location, easy walking to the wharf. The rooms were clean and well appointed. The staff were friendly and helpful. The bar was well stocked. For San Francisco this hotel was very reasonably priced Hotel Caza at Fisherman’s Wharf was a fun place to stay.  We had a great time at the bar.  Al made us feel really welcome and recommended some great drinks.  Fun place to meet other travelers and enjoy some relaxation after exploring San Francisco.   Definitely a great stay if you don't mind walking a little.    The location is probably an easy 10-15 minutes walk to the attractions at Fishermans Wharf with plenty of restaurants even closer by.  A number of Pizza shops only a block away, a crepe restaurant, an ihop, applebees as well as all the restaurants at Pier 39 all within walking distance.    Our checkin was fantastic and front desk staff are helpful.  The facilities are good including swimming pool, fitness centre and kids (and big kids) pool table and games area. Rooms are decent size and housekeeping are efficient.  I would suggest my only downsides are the fact that they dont have a real breakfast option (although there is a grab and go facility as well as tea and coffee facilities) and our only negative experience Loved the hotel, in a perfect spot, we had never been to San Francisco. The perfect walking location to everything! The staff was attentive, and the room was clean, I did not use the bikes, but they had them available.  Had a very enjoyable stay at this hotel. My room was very spacious and next to one other room and a hallway with the fire exit. There did not seem to be a guest in the other room, so it was very quiet and secluded, which was perfect for me. I also had a city view even though I did not request it, which was nice.   I requested the mini fridge when booking my room, and it was already in my room when I checked in. My room was missing the included reusable water pouches, but housekeeping brought them over quickly after I called them.   The utensils, napkins, microwave, and milk and cookies in the lobby were very appreciated. Walgreens and Trader Joe’s were very close by, about a 5 and 10 minute walk.   The air conditioner/heater was pretty loud, especially when trying to sleep, but                    \"},\n",

Nice new and clean hotel.  Thoughtful guest services.  Manager Lisa and her team helped get room ready ahead of arrival as requested.       Good location and easy to get to cable car and beyond.    A step above other hotels in the Hyde street / Bay Street areas — which often look pretty tired.  Good job. We didn't know where to stay in San Francisco. This hotel is right on Fisherman's Warf, where there are lots of restaurants. It is also very easy to reach on foot with the cable car. The hotel has a games room with a pool table, among other things! Great for our children. The marshmallow barbecue by the fire in the courtyard is also perfect. I would go there again in a heartbeat The staff is friendly, room looked like on the pictures, very clean, daily room cleaning, well located - 1 block away from Pier 39 (good neighborhood), easy to arrive from the SFO airport, nice furnierte and style in the whole hotel area, we really liked the garden and the fireplaces - we will come back  Pros: If you are looking for a hotel that is close to Pier 39, you can easily walk there. Also, the lobby and outdoor area have some fun activities for kids.  Cons: We arrived at our room, and I was immediately disappointed. It was small, which isn't a major problem. However, the beds were small and very hard. We ended up leaving after about two hours to find another hotel. We lost what we paid for one night, but it was worth it to find a more comfortable bed. The room and bathroom could use a major facelift. The curtains were literally torn apart, there was toothpaste and soap residual all over the wallpaper.  The best thing about this hotel is the location. We paid for a balcony room and the first room (3221) we stayed in was right next to the parking garage elevator. So you heard that all night. The worst part is how small the bathroom was. There was less than a foot between the toilet and tub. We asked for a new room and the young man who helped us was very accommodating. The second room (4222) had a much bigger bathroom but was missing a towel hook next to the shower and the towel rack was falling off the wall. The hotel just seemed very old and uncared for. The ladies at the concierge desk were so helpful in planning our adventures ! Tatiana and Zakhida were so friendly and helped with all the details.  Thank you ladies you helped make the best of our time in the city!  the absolute WORST hotel you could possibly ever stay at. we were robbed of $800 for our 1 night stay. they refused to return our money, and had to dispute everything with the bank. do NOT stay here.  Our room and  bathroom were dirty. The sink had not been cleaned properly in years and there was graffiti on the ceiling.  The carpet was sticky and looked disgusting. Common areas and stairwells are dirty. The whole hotel is tired and in need of a refurbishment. Great little hotel. Conveniently located near the pier and priced well. Room was clean and comfortable, it had great view, and employees were kindly. We didn’t end up doing the s’mores by the fire pit but it was awesome they offered this to us for free. I’d definitely stay here again. The hotel ist modern and the Service is very good. the Personal is very friendly and helpful.the furniture ist realy and ambiance is something what you must See. the sea Containers and the garden Witze the sculptures is great..... i like that kind of thing.  Let's start with the positives - the hotel is in a great location and easy to get to downtown, China town as well as other places of interest. The beds were comfortable and the staff were friendly. Sadly the hotel is outdated - the rooms are horrible and old (see photos). There was a large and noisy air conditioner at the foot of my bed.  Wouldn't recommend it! I didn't think it was worth almost $1519 - in fact there was an hidden charge of $244 which neither my sister or I saw, which was to be paid at the hotel. Had no idea what the additional charge was for maybe the pointless dart board, or the crazy art deco. I forgot to mention the TV was HUGE! Sorry for the sarcasm folks but for our first trip to San Francisco it wasn't great. If you don't mind staying in a dark room, yes The hotel is perfectly located to enjoy San Fransisco. Casual with individuality. Good for all ages. Looks a bit tired outside on arrival but surprisingly pleasant inside. Staff were very nice. Zakhira was a perfect concierge being helpful and informative. We had a perfect three night stay.  The hotel is modern, but has little to no frills. No room service they also had a hidden room fee. The price was not that great based on no extras. No streaming or pay per view.  You could definitely find a place that was the same price and had a lot more manes than the zephyr  The hotel is quirky and fun, in a good location, is clean and comfortable but really just a bed factory. There is no catering or bar so it is just a dormatory really. The courtyard is fun and the fire pits are supposed to be lit from 4.00 pm. We were there 3 nights and the first 2 it didn’t happen as there was a little rain. Our third night the fire pits were lit when an absolute monsoon happened all afternoon. So the chairs were soaked but the fires were lit. Sadly it was a real downer on our trip. It is a rather impersonal hotel. From introductions by James & Claire, thoughtful welcomes by Joyce, Kathy at the front desk, Ron with a quick maintenance, & Zakhida at concierge - with only a three day stay we instantly were welcomed into the Hotel Zephyr experience!   Hotel is clean, filled with fun/unique decor, with comfy beds & beautiful views. We particularly loved the back patio with fire pits, games, and evening s'mores kits available for purchase (PLUS purchasing a kid donates to an awesome charity!)   As someone who has lived & visited San Francisco plenty of times, I usually avoid Fisherman's Wharf - but this is the perfect hotel to be right in the action without feeling overwhelmingly touristy. Would 100% go back!  The staff are really down to earth! We had a room + the heater kept turning off randomly so I called the desk for options not expecting anything. When I say they moved us in 10 mins - we were shocked! I can’t wait to return here for out future family visits. Take all my money! These people really know how to make a stay easy + enjoyable! Thank You!  OMG… Zakhida the concierge was the best!  She arranged our entire visit making sure we got into all of the things we wanted to see!  She was the best thing about Hotel Zephyr and we had a great stay!  Highly recommend.  We thouroughly enjoyed ourselves and suggest you ask for her by name.  She knows this city inside and pit.  This hotel was uniquely placed in the heart of everything,  Very eclectic, lovely vibe The rooms and the hotel were very clean. The staff was very friendly. The parking was secure. The area of the hotel is close to fisherman’s wharf. I had breakfast at the IHOP next-door and the food was really good. The common grounds around the hotel were clean and nice. Transportation to and from the concert were reasonable. I felt the hotel went beyond normal service to make sure I had a good stay. This is the second time I stayed at this hotel. Lovely hotel, well situated in easy distance to all of the main sights. Everything you need is included and room was very clean. Games room and outside area very nice, free coffee a lovely touch. Plenty of places to top up water bottles. Would definitely stay again!                                         \"},\n",

Very disappointed in our experience here. We stayed found the hotel through the Capital One Lifestyle Brand hotels and can say for sure it does not measure up with the brand. The issues started with our arrival. Valet staff was very polite and helpful always jumping to hold/open the door for you, but that\\'s where the service ended. The checkin process was very off putting. I stepped up to the desk and two hotel employees were standing there conversing in another language. Even though they were both looking at me, neither acknowledged me for a full two minutes. I stood there waiting for a break in their conversation but none came and I eventually had to awkwardly interject to announce my presence.   After I finally got there attention and started to check in, the male hotel Excellent hotel, just one block back from Fisherman\\'s Warf.  Upon arrival the reception was friendly and helpful. Not busy so the receptionist gave us a map and some local information.  We were also given a $ 20 per night credit to use in adjoing restaurant for  a meal or breakfast. The hotel foyer was small but with a fireplace and outdoor firepits (gas). This was a relaxing place to chill in the evening.  The room was a good size for 3 of us. The daughter had a large queen bed to herself.  Large TV, fridge hairdryer, steam iron. The bathroom was also a good size.  There was an ice machine and water fountain on the landings. Great for refilling water bottles. The location of the hotel meant you could walk to the warf, where there were plenty of shops and restaurants.  Also, Stayed here for 2 nights over Christmas Eve and Christmas Day while visiting SF.  The hotel recently changed ownership (within last 2 weeks) but didn’t miss a beat in providing exceptional service for our first trip ever to the Fisherman’s Wharf area.  From the time of our arrival, we were greeted by Ben (truly a gem of a person) and Marco who were friendly, professional, and offered lots of tips and recommendations for our stay.  The location is ideal as Pier 39 is within 5 minutes walking and we could enjoy Ghirardelli Square and the meeting location for our Alcatraz tour within an easy 10-minute walk. We did have a rental car with us and opted to park at the next door “North Shore Garage”, which is a secured underground facility with in/out privileges, however NO 24-hour This hotel is well placed about 2 blocks from Fishermans wharf. Room was comfortable and decent bed/ bathroom. Staff were efficient in calling Taxi when needed. We found it was fine and can recommend. We didn\\'t use restaurant We were looking forward to our stay here.  It seemed like a nice place close to everything and with decent reviews.  We found the room to need much maintenance.  The hot water in this room took about 5 to 10 minutes of keeping the faucets on all of the way to get it hot.   The shower had mold and grout the needed to be replaced.   Closet door was falling off of the hinges. Air conditioning worked intermittently and would not maintain temps for very long and then be awoken every night sweating since it was so warm in the room.   The windows are not sound proofed just single glazing.   Street parting was really loud some nights as well as sirens and cars. The reason has been leaking and the wall paper and drywall behind it was crumbling and moldy.   I started to mention a few Hotel messed up my reservation, then double charged for the room by \"forgetting\" to issue a refund to my card, despite numerous calls at the time.  I only realised 3 months later when checking statements.  Beware. Friendly helpful reception staff, rooms were clean, beds were comfortable, excellent location for visiting fisherman’s wharf, a 2 minutes walk, beautiful restaurants serving the best breakfasts, all in all a nice hotel, no bad points… Extremely convenient location. Clean rooms and very friendly front desk.  Offers complimentary coffee/tea every morning and smores in the evening.  Mr Frank our valet was extremely helpful and made our stay really welcoming.  The hotel is within walking distance to the wharf, pier 39 and pier 33 (for the alcatraz city cruise), and also traders joe, Starbucks and also walgreens.  If you fancy asian food, there is a Thai Bistro round the corner. The location of the hotel is walking distance from Fisherman\\'s Wharf. The staff were very responsive and helpful, even giving recommendations for places to go. Rowena and Roy were very friendly throughout our stay and were great to have conversations with. The first time experience of staying at Hotel Zoe was great overall and would definitely come again Great location and great staff! I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Rwanda at the front desk is the best! The valet, Benedict, rocks! Convenient to everything that San Francisco offers. We will be back😎 Excellent location, extremely helpful staff, and awesome rooms and community amenities! The location is perfect, and they share a discount with you to use at restaurants walking distance away at Pier 39. We also had a lovely room with a comfortable bed. And the staff is so friendly and will help you with anything you need! Read all of the fine print before you commit.  This place will nickel and dime you at every turn. Convenient location but noisy.  Climate control in the room was very finicky.  Extra Guest Amenity fee is mandatory and adds another $40 per night to your cost for unnecessary \"discounts\" that don\\'t really add up, especially if you are checking in late and can\\'t even use the restaurant voucher the first night. We had a lovely stay at the hotel. Staff was excellent, special thanks to Frank who was going the extra length for us, gave advice on local places to visits and for excellent restaurants around the area. Would totally recommend Great service, great location, room was a little small, but the bed was very comfortable, and the pillows were great. The location was perfect with the waterfront 2 blocks away, and the cable car and ticket office also 2 blocks away.  1 block away there is a small supermarket and across the road an excellent Thai restaurant. The service desk was good, and the breakfasts in the little restraunt are really good, a big call out to Jose Rene in the restaurant and the staff at the front desk for a great service.  If I was coming back to SF, I would more than likely stay here again.  This is a great hotel. It’s clean, the staff is friendly and the location is perfect. The restaurant/bar is lovely with good food and an attentive staff. The S’mores on the patio at night were a pleasant surprise. I’d stay here again, no question! I came for a half marathon race and this hotel was given as a referral. The hotel was perfectly situated a few short blocks from Fisherman Wharf.  The rooms were clean and well stocked.  Beds and pillows were great as I rested extremely well.    Hotel Zoe was a new hotel to stay at for us. Came for a family weekend. Go to SF often, never knew about this hotel Location great if you want to be in the Ghirardelli / Embarcadero area. Friendly employees everywhere!.Had breakfast there, Food great at Pescadero, hotel’s restaurant.  Room big and clean. Would stay again  Hotel Zoe was lovely and clean. Be warned there is an extra hidden cost staying at this motel. My wife and I travelled from Australia, with all our accommodation and taxes paid for, only to be charged an extra $50AUS per day, total of an extra $500AUS at end of the stay. When we didn\\'t want to pay this amount, the receptionist informed us that it was compulsory - this was to cover the cost of roasting smalls (marshmallows) if you wished, and they give you $20USD to spend daily at their restaurant, and use their electric bikes......So basically like us, we don\\'t like marshmallows, and we did not wish to ride the bikes.  Overall the motel was quiet nice and the cleaning excellent, but the rooms can be quiet noisy of a night time, from cars screeching up the road and although the Main issues, staff unwilling to assist or offer assistance, access to all lobby bathrooms/courtyard without using the 1 elevator with access to floor 1R & heavy doors without electric opening assist.   Room adequate, however \"courtyard view\" was of a large Dish satellite, dirty roof & outdoor patio of neighboring building.  This is a great hotel very well situated at Fishermans Wharf. The rooms are clean and spacious and well thought out. The staff here are excellent and very helpful and the attched restauarant serves excellent food. This was a cozy hotel in a great location. I could easily walk to many attractions along Fisherman\\'s Wharf and The Embarcadero, as well as the North Beach neighborhood. The staff were responsive and welcoming. Came for a work meeting. The meetings team and catering were phenomenal.  Close to everything. No gym though, but you can use the gym at a nearby hotel and its really nice. It\\'s in a walkable community. Plenty of restaurants nearby. I would definitely return to stay here again.  My second visit to Hotel Zoe was as wonderful as the first.  Love, love, love this hotel!!  Beautiful room, great restaurant and the best staff.  Roy checked us in and was so pleasant and efficient.  He remembered my name and greeted me every day.  Benedict brought in our bags and got us settled in our room with the utmost kindness. One of the things I love about Hotel Zoe is having a morning cup of coffee in front of the fireplace, listening to great music.  The ambience is very comfortable and cozy.   Great proximity to cable cars, Fisherman’s Wharf and lots of other activities.  Safe underground parking, very important these days. This hotel charges a resort fee but does not provide any resort ammenties. There is no on-site parking only a $65 per night valet option. There was a wine/beer tap in the lobby but it did not work. Front desk staff seemed bothered by my questions and requests for recommendations. Concierge was basically non-existent. Hotel Zoe is located just a few minutes\\' walk from the fabulous Fisherman\\'s Wharf and some of the best restaurants in San Francisco. The hotel is upscale in nature but not in price. The rooms are really neat and clean, and the beds are among the most comfortable I\\'ve ever experienced in any hotel (and I travel a lot, including internationally). The staff was really super - very professional yet personable and friendly. The food in the restaurant is awesome as well! Overall, this is something of a hidden gem in one of the best locations in the city. I would stay here again in an instant. Lovely boutique hotel within a short walk of Pier 39, Cable Car stops and had on site restaurant and parking. Great location and friendly staff. Also had an outside area which was very cosy in the evening with outside real flame fires and blankets to snuggle up with Hotel is well located but you are charged $40 per room per night for resort fees and the parking is $75 per night.  Room are clean but do not include tea or coffee making facilities.  Coffee is available in the morning in the lobby  The room was very comfortable and the restaurant had very good food and the service was exceptional.  Jose\\' was very professional and helpful with our stay and Ben the valet was very personable and professional as well.  Thank you for a wonderful stay. Nice hotel with a good placing for discovering San Francisco. Nice Big Roms. Reasonably quiet neighburhood. Nice and serviceminded perosonal. Only uups was that some times the A/C was a bit noisy. Hope this Will be fixed for the next giest.  Great hotel, the associate Benedict Demafeliz is wonderful, he made the experience nice, hidden fees for extra people are not a good surprise. Especially when the room is already paid for multiple people. The location was perfect! The hotel Was perfect for us would highly recommend  The room was a good size. Had a corner unit and was very quiet. If your going to visit the area I would Say to stay at this location  We had a four days stay in Zoe Fisherman’s Warf. Such a great place to spend a few days in SF. Very cousy hotel with super friendly staff, spotless rooms and great breakfast included in the room rate. We could not have found a better place than your hotel for an European family of four members! This place was great. Definitely recommend it. Close to the wharves and other sites. The staff were very helpful and I would definitely highly recommend the restaurant that\\'s attached to the hotel on street level. My son and I loved the place. Receptionist work ear pods while speaking with us.  Didn’t explain or promote any of the hotel facilities.  Overcharged us at check in for the USA resort fees everywhere seems to have, but we’re still not sure what these fees cover.  EXTREMELY small room for 2 people.  Only 1 chair and 1 luggage rack.  Had to continually pack up suitcases to move around room.  No kettle. Was offered a microwave for a fee, although I’m not sure where they would have put it.  Very clean, good location for walking around city.  good location. friendly staff. easy check-in and check-out process. overall, it served its purpose - a room for 1 night in san francisco to sleep and get ready in. however, was disappointed with the shower/water quality - it came out brown Excellent location for Fisherman\\'s Wharf and Pier 39. Clean, lovely and inviting hotel with very comfortable bedding, beautiful bathroom, friendly and helpful staff, a great restaurant on site, and a safe parking on site. My now-wife and I were looking for a place to stay for our elopement in San Francisco. We found Hotel Zoe through AARP (not just for old folks now) and thought it would suffice to crash at the end of the night. Little did we know this would be the best hotel stay of our lives. The location is perfect for access to many attractions, the staff went above and beyond to accommodate us and our wedding photography and the bed felt like we were sleeping on a cloud. We wouldn’t have dreamt of a more perfect wedding, and Hotel Zoe made it all that more special! Special mention to Mildred, Jose and Roy for taking the extra steps in accommodating our special day and for the bottle of wine. Cheers! The rooms in hotel were great and very comfortable. Shower’s fantastic. The lobby/lounge was very comfy with a nice atmosphere. Food in restaurant was excellent with great service. Great location and very easy to get to all the places we needed to see. Broken coffee machine no microwave without request there\\'s better places to stay yeah what I own three companies and I would never treat my customers like this to have them request a microwave please they\\'re $20 a piece the staff was very nice'},\n",

His service was definitely a 10 out of 10!!!  On another note:  Give this man a raise for taking great care of people! I\\'ve stayed at the Westin St. Francis several times and all my stays have been exceptional; however, my recent stay exceeded my expectations. The hotel is beautiful. The bar was fantastic and the drinks even better. We walked everywhere. To Chinatown, North Beach, the Embarcadero, downtown, and more. Everything is so accessible. The rooms have always been superb. The views from the tower are breathtaking. The best part of this trip was the concierge. I\\'ve never used the concierge before. This time I had a few questions about getting a drink at the Top of the Mark and going for dim sum. The concierge (Jeff) really took care of us. Apart from being a very nice and genuine human, he gave us cable car tickets, which I think came with my hotel membership, but I didn\\'t know about it. The Experience was nothing short than Amazing. We came to celebrate my 30th birthday for the weekend. The Hotel was beyond Beautiful, and the service was Fantastic. Jeff from the Concierge Desk went above and beyond for me. He helped my boyfriend set up a surprise room service Champagne bottle with a pretty fruit basket and a card that made my day. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone, and ask for Jeff at the concierge Desk. He’ll treat you like Family. Jeff Aquino was the concierge there during our stay he went above and beyond and every way possible so patient helpful and pleasant. I will come stay there again just because of his customer service. He helped us fine a nice place to have dinner etc. I was invited to stay at the Westin St. Francis on Jan. 5-7, 2024 and I want to write of one outstanding individual, Jeff Aquino who is the Concierge during our stay.  Jeff was very professional, helpful, kind and mindful!  He made sure that we had everything we needed, never rushed us and he actually listened, this was from day one until we checked out.  Jeff never forgot our names and greeted us everyday, sure made us feel important. He is a rare gem and employees with his ethics and professionalism are very hard to find these days. If I had a business I would hire Jeff to represent my establishment.  Jeff made our stay much more enjoyable.  Please stop by and say hello to Jeff when you stay at the Westin St. Francis, San Francisco.  10 Stars for Jeff!!!! Being in Union Square during Christmas-time is such a magical experience so to have gotten to stay at the St. Francis was such a treat! My boyfriend and I were lucky enough to get a room with a view of the beautiful tree and rink and were very comfortable in our room. Everything was clean, organized and accessible. Though what made our experience especially memorable was the hotel staff, all of whom were  very courteous and welcoming. Jeff Aquino, the concierge, made our stay even more special with his friendly manner and generosity. He went the extra mile to ensure we made the most of our time in the city. He was such a delight to chat with and we thoroughly appreciate his efforts to make our holiday stay special. Thank you Jeff and to the rest of the St. Francis staff! Beautiful hotel with comfortable rooms and a lovely history! I highly recommend doing the tour of the hotel on Saturdays w the hotel historian Howard Mutz who had a lot of interesting facts and stories to share about the hotel. Staff were helpful and friendly. A particular shoutout to Jeff Aquino at the Concierge desk who went above and beyond to assist us during our stay. Stayed during a busy conference. All staff with whom I interacted were polite and attentive, helping me find a notary for a document I needed to sign, and finding me a replacement when my power adaptor broke. In particular, concierge Jeff Aquino was most helpful. Thanks! From the moment we entered The Westin St. Francis San Francisco on Union Square at check-in until we said our farewells at check-out, the service we received from Jeff Aquino and team was second to none. Not only was the professionalism top tier, but each time we stoped by concierge to ask Jeff a question or the front desk for a reservation question, we were treated exceptionally. Their friendliness was genuine and inviting. The bistro had a nice pasta station with good beverage selections. Centrally located to great shopping, the hotel was beautifully decorated for the holiday season. The cable car was easily accessible and took us on a nice tour on the way to Pier 39.  We look forward to returning in the coming months.  Check in was painful for my colleagues and I.   There were 2 front desk agents and only one helped us. The other was busy surfing on the web. (See attached pic)  Front desk agent was impatient and unfriendly. We had an early arrival so we did a pre block. Despite having our passports, she didn’t bother to check the names vs the names in the bookings. When told that the bookings were made under individual names and not as a group, she claimed that she couldn’t verify our status (we are titanium) as the bookings might have been made under one titanium member for all. We reminded her that all bookings are individual and she can check the name in the booking with our passports which she had. Impatiently, she flipped her screen to us to ask us to check if this was our names.   Went Great Location and great hotel for solo or business trip, nice comfortable beds. However I don\\'t think they really care about the Gold Marriot members compared to any other higher status members within Marriot .   This hotel was beyond perfect for our vacation. It offered many amenities! Jeff Aquino was definitely a big part of this beautiful hotel experience. He was very welcoming and was a joy to talk to. Definitely will be back.  My wife and I stayed here for a night before heading to Napa for the week and really enjoyed our stay.  Check in was really easy and the staff was so nice.  You get some perks when checking in like free trolley tickets or a cocktail in the bar so they explain all of that to you.  Our room was in the Tower and was awesome with a great view.  The hotel is right on Union Square.  We stayed in mid-December and the hotel was decorated for Christmas and it looked amazing as did the Square.  We did not rent a car and getting an Uber in just a couple of minutes was very easy.  The location of the hotel is excellent and near so many attractions it\\'s a great central point to stay.  We will be back! As a long time visitor to the Weston’s stunning lobby decorations, we FINALLY were able to stay here. Ease in reservation, great price with a few extras like the free cable car tickets that were a total surprise which we used the next day! A word about the elevators-they were the fastest and most efficient I’ve ever seen-punch in your floor number or tap your room key and bam, you’re there.   Our room was in the newer ‘tower’ not the original part of the hotel-I’ll ask for that on our next visit. Spacious, great view of Coit Tower & the Bay, comfortable beds and everything was so clean. My only gripe was the flat shower head raining down until I figured out how to use the attached wand.  The room has a mini fridge and coffee maker but no microwave (not needed anyway)   Christmas My wife and I recently spent a couple of days at the Westin St Francis Hotel in San Francisco and I requested help from their concierge, Jeff Aquino.  What a splendid and informative person he was.  Jeff has got to be one of the friendliest concierges I have ever met.  He was very patient and helpful in answering my questions and helping to fulfill the hotel\\'s hospitality bonuses.  He gave great directions and instructions that were easy to follow.  He is a definite keeper, Westin St Francis!  Great person in that position!  Thanks, Jeff!  I can’t say enough about how friendly, enthusiastic and accommodating the staff was at this iconic SF location. They checked in 600 (yes, 600) the day I arrived and they remained cheerful and accommodating. I called prior for special room arrangements and they not only delivered but my rooms were over the top! Thanks to Emily for her friendly and responsive help. I sat each year at Christmas and will keep coming back. Thanks for making our Holiday trip a joy!!! I was double charged by the westin st francis!  I paid for the hotel in advance through Agoda and then upon my stay I was charged again for my stay!  I have been going back and forth with the 3rd party app trying to get ahold of westin without a response and it has been almost 2 weeks!  Very disappointing as I take my family here every year during Christmas. We had a wonderful stay with our young children. The hotel is kid friendly and felt safe. Huge shoutout to Carly for reminding me why I love being a Bonvoy member! Amazing service and great beds and pillows, as always!  This hotel is an amazing location with a charming lobby. The rooms, unfortunately, do not match the grandeur of the surroundings, as they are not great and are in dire need of serious updates.  However, my biggest complaint is with the service, particularly the burly, bearded gentleman who worked at the check-in counter in the morning. He was extremely rude when I was providing simple feedback about the destination fee, started accusing me of getting mad at him. I\\'m a soft spoken person and he was responding with practically shouted and condescending remarks. I have never seen hotel staff treating their customers in such a manner before.  The hotel sits at Union Square, and this time of year, it is the place to be. Upon entering the lobby, you are immediately introduced to The Sugar Castle, an artistically designed structure with extreme details. There was always a crowd gathered to see this beautiful structure. The lobby is large and clean, and the staff at check-in as well as the concierge and the valets are all very helpful. The rooms are large and mostly clean (don\\'t go behind the bed tables; I was looking for a plug and encountered some extreme dust bunnies!), and the wi-fi was fast. The only complaint is that the bed was very firm. I have back pain and hip pain, exacerbated by laying on trigger points, and the beds for me, were very uncomfortable. So, I didn\\'t get much sleep. If this were to change, or if                     The market servers zekphia and Mari and the rest of the staff I  would of given 5 stars but the rude bar  manager  made me not want to come back to this hotel sorry to say that we wish you all the best but please don’t underestimate your rude bar manager ! The staff in the market should be in the bar ! Great hotel Great location  There was a mix up on our booking they couldn’t find our booking but eventually they did and they dealt with it very professionally  I don’t write many reviews but on this occasion I have to write a review about the bar manager/supervisor on Thursday 16th November he is a disgrace to the hotel he works in the clock bar he was so rude  The staff in the coffee dock were amazing and good fun  Overall great hotel if I was the general manager I would sack the bar manager sorry  but he was so rude we had a bottle of Prosecco on the second night in the coffee area rather than going in the bar This was our first time staying at the Westin and it was truly an amazing experience. From parking to room service everything was great. The best part of our stay was the wonderful concierge, Jeff Aquino, who was sooo accommodating and made our stay feel really special ! We told him we were celebrating our anniversary and he gave us some extra perks. He was so friendly and approachable, it was like we were friends already. He definitely made this memorable and we look forward to our next stay.  Thanks Jeff!!!  PROs: I keep asking for the landmark tower - the elegance of the high ceilings and windows cannot be matched, in my opinion. CONs: none, really, although they\\'re renovating the breakfast restaurant - which is one of my fav spot. You dine in a conference room instead. EXPERIENCE: My 4th stay with family in 11 months. This time, like actually the last one, Concierge brought the whole experience to a higher level for us. I want to recommend the elegance and customer understanding shown by Jeff - kids and parents were elated of his help in guiding on \\'what to do next. Truly a pleasure. Other people make you feel welcome: the senior Valet, people at the lobby desk, the breakfast check in and waiters. The decorations for the fall and Halloween gave a lively touch - well done. We\\'ll We choose this hotel because of the restaurant since we have disability. Instead the restaurant is closed and we paid full price anyway and the manager on duty didn\\'t give us any assistance.  We are very disappointed This is my new favorite hotel and I highly recommend ! It is perfectly located near fantastic shopping and restaurants. The rooms is very comfy. The staff at the front desk and housekeeping? Beyond pleasant and nice..they are genuine.  The hotel is beautifully decorated and it’s quiet. Refined and feels like home Had an absolutely amazing stay at the Westin!  From check in to check out the experience was one of the best travel experiences I have had.  I do not often write reviews anymore, but I felt the customer service was incredible enough that I was compelled to let readers know.  The stay here was made even better by the concierge, Jeff Aquino.  He went above and beyond to ensure a very memorable stay.  It was my birthday and I was attending 49ers game and Jeff helped make signs to take to the stadium.  Those signs were incredibly thoughtful.  He sincerely enjoys his position and making sure every guest feels like they are VIPs.  As he was helping us, many other guests walked by, waved, and said, \"hi Jeff.\"  Felt less like guests and more like family.  The room was amazing as well!  The hotel was beautiful. From the stunningly gorgeous entryway and lobby to the history everywhere, it was more than we expected. All employees were so kind, in particular Jeff and David at the concierge desk. They gave us the most amazing dinner recommendations and answered all questions we had. They really personalized our experience, and even remembered our names our entire stay. We would DEFINITELY stay here again.  My wife and I went to SF for our 33rd Anniversary. As a gold elite Marriott member, I am supposed to get upgrades upon availability. The front desk clear Elaine was pleasant enough but only gave us a higher floor upgrade. She offered to upgrade us to a suite but it would have cost us $$$. I also called them 2 weeks earlier to tell them it was our anniversary. Normally with these types of life events we would have received some type of welcome such as chocolate covered strawberries, champaign, etc. NOTHING! When I spoke with the manager Ben to ask him, he was very rude and condescending. I will NEVER go back to nor will I recommend anyone go to this particular Marriott property. The cleanliness of the hotel was superb. They clearly take attention to detail throughout. The beds are comfortable. The location is convenient. The service is what made this stay stand above others. Every encounter with hotel personal was pleasant. Exceptional service was encountered at the concierge. Meeting Jeff was a highlight that stretches beyond the walls of the hotel. My encounter with him is something I take home as a highlight of the trip. His sincere tone, respectful demeanor, and appropriate eye contact as he made quality recommendations was much appreciated. He took the time to explain the hotel and surrounding area in detail. I will be back at The Westin for all SF stays.'},\n",

I'd heard a lot about the Nikko brand over the years, and was curious to try it out when our conference was set here.  Great location near Union Square with a lot of interesting shopping and dining options around. Cafe Mason, Pinecrest Diner, all in easy walking distance. The food at the hotel was very good with very attentive staff. Buffet had Japanese dishes as to be expected from the brand in addition to the standard breakfast fare. A little pricey, but probably on par given the location and type of hotel. Got a room on an upper floor with a fantastic view of downtown. The conference rooms had amazing views of the city. Rooms were on the medium size, not huge, but not tiny either. No desk, but could still work on the table in the room. Fluffy robes, towels and slippers It would have been nice to know  that the Imperial Lounge was closing for renovations when I booked a room just days before our stay.  Was there a price break? I don’t think so. Not likely to return. Rooms are fine but nothing great, a little small and somewhat dated yet clean. Buffet breakfast was good. We have great memories of the Hotel Nikko in Ho Chi Minh City and sadly, the SF Hotel Nikko did not compare. Location is fine if you’re used to SF. Very close to not so fine areas.  I enjoyed my time, and will return. I recommend this hotel to anyone. View, walk in shower and the large bed are great, but the location and friendly staff made our stay great. If your going to San Francisco I would suggest staying there. Hotel Nikko is my favorite hotel in San Francisco. Every time that I am in town I try and stay at the Nikko. The location is great and the rooms are spacious, comfortable, and modern with all the amenities of a luxury hotel. The customer service is exceptional. The staff is very professional, especially the front desk, and they go out their way to make the customers feel special. I can’t say enough about the Hotel Nikko. Give it a try! Nice staff and personnel, but hotel needs better upkeep. Hallways needed painting. Closets so packed with old refrigerator and safe that no where tp lay shoes. Drain in bathroom was musty smelling. At least it was quiet. We had a very pleasant stay at the Nikko hotel. A big thank you to the reception staff and Ernesto for their welcome and their excellent listening skills. We will come back without hesitation Thank you so much !!! Great location close to cable car and buses. Wonderfully comfortable beds, pillows, linens and bathrobes. I enjoyed the giant tub in addition to the shower, though my husband didn’t like that only the shorter handheld shower head had decent water pressure. Beautifully designed common spaces and a delightful pool area / health club bathed in natural light. Most of the staff was really great, too. The front desk attendant read the notes on our reservation carefully and took the time to ensure that we had a room with a really nice view. All of the housekeeping staff was incredibly helpful and most spoke English. We didn’t bring a car, so we especially appreciated the luggage valet, who made it easy to do some sightseeing before/after check-in.   However, our stay was not without a Excellent location. Friendly staff who are always willing to help you. Rooms are very clean and the beds are comfortable. Food at Anzu was delicious and was even better because we got credit towards the restaurant. The hotel is always very clean and comfortable. The amenities are excellent and the staff is professional and friendly. For the price, it’s the best. The gym and pool area are wonderful. The breakfast buffet is delicious. Stay was going well until a dressing gown that I had placed hanging on the bathroom door so to avoid being mixed up with dirty towels went missing. Despite the fact I reported the missing gown to reception as I did not wish to be charged, it seems the impression is I’ve either stolen it or have a severe memory relapse of where I left it! Smirking staff on reception thinking it was highly amusing, when I tried to discuss. This was an awesome hotel. The service really made it stand out more than anything! Great people working here! Also, it was very clean and welcoming. I would definitely stay here again & will recommend it!  Book directly with hotel to not pay the $39 facility fee.  The gym has a Pilates reformer and everything you need.  The health club and pool area are impressively clean and relaxing.  The breakfast buffett is a wonderful relaxing way to start the morning with phenomenal service.  The best part of our hotel experience is how we felt calmness throughout our stay. From the friendly “welcome back” from the door staff and breakfast staff to the exceptional housekeeping. We felt genuine caring through the small gestures from unseen people and from everyone we interacted with that added up to an exceptional stay. Calm luxury is experiencing SF Nikko. Hotel Nikko is at a pretty handy location to the restaurants, cafes, and the public transportation. Staff are very friendly. Security is quite good too. A kettle in the room would be good for making my own coffee. Stayed there for 6 nights to attend a nearby conference. Enjoyed the pool, hot tub, sauna and hammam  every night to relax and help with jet lag. Staff helped book restaurants and gave recommendations. Very helpful and friendly. I just left my annual Christmas shopping stay with my kids, who are now adults. It was amazing like always. So nourishing, satisfying, and convenient…..I’ll definitely be back again next year, if not before. I've stayed at Hotel Nikko multiple times over the past 20+ years while attending the annual AGU Conference in December. The rooms are immaculate with great views. The location is excellent, within easy walking distance of the Moscone Center, Union Square, China Town, and many great restaurants. The staff are super friendly and helpful. And, Johnny Foley's Irish House is just across the street! An attractive, high-quality accommodation just two blocks from Union Square and six blocks from the Moscone Center. Excellent front desk service, nice pool and fitness room. The Anzu is a nice high-end Japanese restaurant. Lots of lower cost dining options available nearby.  Our trip was planned a number of months and a key requirement of our accommodation was a hotel that made it easy to visit the key tourist attractions in San Francisco. We found Hotel Nikko to be a wonderful hotel for a five night stay, perfectly located to allow easy access to key tourist spots.  Nice hotel, very friendly and welcoming staff. Location is really good buzzing of life all around. Clean room and hotel in general, next time I have business in the area I will consider Hotel Nikko again, however the bed was not very comfortable., so if I come back I'll ask for a possible room change if bed feels the same. A beautiful property - and the location makes it easy to get around the Bay Area! The friendly staff, amenities & fantastic restaurant put this hotel at the TOP of the list! We enjoyed the views and the Imperial Lounge was a bonus!  Love staying at Hotel Nikko in SF.  The facility and staff are exceptional.  Location can’t be beat for access to shopping and restaurants.  Would recommend staying at Hotel Nikko for business or leisure. I can't state enough how wonderful the staff was at the hotel which is unusual now days. The front desk staff Gordon and Ricky helped me more that you can imagine. Also, the hotel is beautiful, clean, safe and quiet. This will be my hotel of choice going forward. Love this hotel. Stayed at the imperial Suite and I am in awe at the design, cleanliness and location. AN invite was extended at the Imperial lounge for 5PM cocktails and hot snacks and that was cool. At night, chocolate treats are in the bed. Would highly recomment this place. Don't go elsewhere. BTW a $39 resort fee is added for use of amenities. Which all hotel does nowadays.  Hotel Nikko is a gem that is in a class of its own.  While it can accommodate conferences, meetings, weddings and private functions, it has the warmth and intimacy of a boutique hotel. There is a Japanese philosophy called omotenashi.  It means wholehearted attentiveness.  We LOVE this hotel for their amazing hospitality.  We return often because we’re welcomed like family for celebrations, shopping and sightseeing. The location is perfect, the staff are over the top.  They remember names, make cool recommendations, they are attentive and accommodating.  You’ll have a much better stay than the giant chain hotels.  The food and entertainment, the pool, beautiful rooms…some with crazy gorgeous views!  Meet friends for drinks or dinner, relax in the gorgeous lobby, you’ll forget We booked for a week and stayed for 1 night only!   Miserable atmosphere, depressing reception at arrival. Nobody around, no staff available for the check in, after 20 min. a guy with no smile arrived for the check in. This hotel belongs to the Okura group, a high end Japan hotel group, This hotel must be the exception  of the rule, it's dated, sad and empty, no need to say more! We absolutely loved this hotel.  Every staff member we interacted with was friendly and helpful, especially Luis in the Lounge.  Clean, modern, beautiful, great location.  We will definitely stay here again! An excellent hotel with large rooms, great food and friendly staff. The location is within easy reach of all the Downtown shopping and restaurants like nearby Union Square. It really is an oasis in SF I've stayed here twice this year and overall was very pleased with service from the hotel. Hardware wise, the hotel is a 3 star, but service wise it is 5+ star. Good location close to Union Square, within 3-5 minute walk b  The front desk agent kindly upgraded me to a club room. Flying in from Shanghai, this was greatly appreciated as I was exhausted and just wanted to grad an apple and yoghurt before sleeping rather than running out of the hotel for a meal. Stafg at the lounge excellent with a good set up of snacks all day and night (security let me in at 4am to grab a granola bar and yogurt)  Excellent gym with dumbbells that go up to 75 pounds.   My keys never seemed to work. Had to get them replaced several times   Overall, I'd stay here again. Usually staff in US not great Hotel Nikko is placed just right in the heart of downtown but far enough from the shaddy areas on market street and down town.  The hotel is classy without the high prices.  All of the personell We encountered were highly attentive and nice.  Would stay here again.                    \"},\n",

       "  'hotel_description': \"Located in the heart of San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf, Argonaut Hotel exudes the true essence of a boutique hotel. With a name like the Argonaut, it's impossible not to speak of this hotel in grand, almost legendary terms. Inspired by the Greek legend and Gold Rush-era adventurers, it's one of those rare places in San Francisco that truly merits a term like iconic. Located in the historic Haslett Warehouse, the Argonaut's home is a grand building built in 1907 of exposed brick, Douglas Fir beams and so much seaside character; you feel as though you can almost reach out and touch the colorful Barbary Coast past here.\",\n",

The hotel has so many perks, great food and is local to everything. Will be back and would definitely recommend!  Loved this hotel! Just returned from a long weekend at the Argonaut celebrating a milestone birthday and anniversary. The room was the perfect size and tastefully decorated with a great view of the water. Restaurant was great —delicious breakfasts and a nice spot for cocktails. All the staff at the hotel and restaurant  were incredibly helpful, thoughtful  and accommodating. Thank you!! Our favorite SF hotel to bring our cocker spaniel puppy with us when we are traveling. They make our puppy feel welcomed and very comfortable. It is a perfect location for walking around the park, beach and restaurants. We had a great stay and were treated well.   I even road out a mild earthquake from our room on the third floor.   You cannot beat this location.   Highly recommend.   Very helpful staff. Our kids also had an amazing time and liked the restaurant in the hotel. The hotel was very well run. The staff was accomodating& very friendly. Check in time is 3pm but they let us checking at 1. Plenty of free waters. Needed help... there in 5 minutes   We had a horrible breakfast at the blue mermaid but I still gave 5 stars because other family members had nice meals so I will assume this was an aberration  Had a lovely stay there, nice a peaceful close, rooms were clean tidy and overall the hotel was just perfect and staff very helpful . Close to shops and restaurants and a good base for exploring. If I ever went back (which I doubt) would definatley stay there  I am usually very loyal to Hilton. However, on this trip we wanted a bay view and preferably a view of Alcatraz island. So, I reluctantly booked a non Hilton property as all their locations were a considerable distance from the bay.  We booked a suite and had a great view of Alcatraz island. The suite itself was laid out very well. Great bed and convenient bathroom.  If I had anything negative to say it would be they charge a $30 something resort fee and then give you part of it back if you eat breakfast in their restaurant. The part they give you covers about a third of breakfast. Small thing but I’m used to free breakfast at Hilton.  Definitely made the right decision staying here. Everyone was nice and particularly the valet and the bell staff. Look, this isn't going to be the fanciest stay you can find, but it's a great location for the price.   Resort fees are incredibly high given the amenities, but they were clearly disclosed and we chose to accept them.  The location is perfect for the touristy Fisherman's Wharf San Fran experience.  Everything is within walking distance - Ghiradelli Square, Pier 39, cable cars, restaurants, Palace of Fine Art, etc.  If healthy walks are not possible for your group, ubers were $10 or less to all of these attractions.  We did NOT appreciate the hotel chosing to leave a carefully cellophaned stuffed animal sea lion to tempt a child upon entering the room for the first time.   That just lacks tact - I would hope management would reconsider better ways to let parents know that stuffed Booked a great deal which if booked before October 1st, staying between October and December 31st you get free breakfast if you stay three or more nights, I booked 6 nights. I booked this over other hotels because it included breakfast. The hotel will not honour this. It was my reason for booking and I only booked it 9 days ago.  I was given a room with two beds, I wanted and booked one, they moved me to a room with a very noisy air conditioning unit, it is so loud had to keep turning it off in  the night and it totally disrupted my sleep… then I’m awoken at 6am by the alarm clock which I didn’t even realise I had, it startled me and I couldn’t get back to sleep. House keeping should always check alarm clocks on departure as this has ruined our first day.   Only one very slow The hotel is clean, well situated at Fisherman’s Wharf and has a pleasant staff. But, with only 1 very slow working elevator, it was challenging getting to your room. The towel rack was inside the tub area, so towels had to be stored outside the bathroom if you wanted dry towels. At checkout, I was charged the incorrect amount. Eventually, the bill was corrected but then was changed again for a mini bar item that I never used. Eventually, the mini bar charge was credited back to my charge card. Was a pleasant stay at the hotel, but would not return.  We have just spent two weeks at the Argonaut as our base for our vacation in San Francisco. It proved to be great choice. A very comfortable hotel with welcoming staff particularly in the restaurant. A great location  on Fisherman’s Wharf and right next to one of the cable car terminus.   The bedroom was comfortable and housekeeping was always thorough. We ate a couple of times in the restaurant. I felt the menu was a bit limited and could have been improved with more daily specials. The staff in the restaurant were all very helpful and friendly.   The only downside was one of the two lifts wasn’t working for almost the whole two weeks we stayed hence we often had long waits for the lift.  We would definitely recommend this hotel. Exterior and lobby really nice, room very unimpressive. Felt very small, odd layout, long walk from lift and located next to a busy street. Old school overpriced minibar that charged for everything, including bottled water. Bathroom old and tired, general meh vibes Excellent location on the waterfront!  This hotel is directly in front of Fisherman’s wharf, close to restaurants and shops, right next to cable cars, with a view of the Bridge and Alcatraz.  Within walking distance of lots of things including the amazing aquarium.  My negative points include the high cost ( and several additional taxes) as well as the impossibility to ever find the concierge.  The restaurant has a delicious crab chowder as well as a crab breakfast omelette.  Arrived in San Francisco after a 6.5 hour flight from Delaware. Was impressed when entered but all that came crashing down when we started our check-in process. Mind you…we are here for my daughters 10th birthday celebration. As my husband was checking in I stood to the left of him as normally. The gentleman checking us in spoke super loud that the room we had book was a 1 bed and there were 3 of us. He restated this 3 times till I replied…yes…we are a family. The female walked up to the second checkin computer which I was standing in front of she says, “can you move”. There was no one in the line but a gentleman and wife standing in the waiting area about 5-7 steps behind me. She called out to the gentleman, “Sir…Sir”. Coming from a high end resort town in Delaware we are Excellent hotel!  Great location, clean spacious rooms and friendly staff.  We had a Bay view room and loved waking up to see the Golden Gate Bridge every morning!  Cozy lobby where you can sit and relax after walking the streets or touring the city.  We would definitely stay there again. After 6 weeks on the road this hotel stands out as the best accommodation we have ever stayed in. This includes 5 star hotels all around the world and 6 Fairmomt Hotels on this holiday. The things that make it stand out are:  1. The interior decoration, both in the public areas and the rooms, is exceptional. An old theme (maritime) done well. It's so refreshing to open the door to a room that isn't white bed linen and brown furniture. 2. The size of the room was very generous and well thought out with everything appearing to be in the right place for convenient living. 3. The premises had everything. A restaurant offering 3 meals a day which had a good menu and friendly staff; a lounge area which felt luxurious and was a great spot for a drink or just to relax and a wine bar if this place is waaaay cool and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful  \\u200b\\u200b \\u200b\\u200bWe had a harbour view room which obs had a great view out across the harbour and could see Alcatraz . Our room had everything we needed   Great location right in the heart of the tourist vicinity . Easy to walk along the waters edge , see the seals, lots of food , near the chocolate place , bike hire places , gocar hire . Basically close to everything   \\u200b\\u200bFood at the Restaurant is delicious . I especially loved the chowder , yummy I travel to SF for business at least 6 times a year, have stayed at most of the hotels around SF, I must say the staff at this hotel is very friendly & courteous,  from the doorman to the front desk and the restaurant, hotel itself is very well setup with its nautical theme and exposed brick & beams, my room was clean and refreshing, had views of the bay and the park next door. I’ll be sure to come back and visit. myself and my husband booked 4 nights as part of our honeymoon and celebration for my husband's birthday in California  We arrived at the hotel about 9.30pm so were rather tired after our long flight but we got a warm welcome on arrival and check in was quick and easy.  Our suitcases arrived quickly to our room so we could get settled in.   We booked an Internal King room.  it was a spacious room with a good sized bathroom with shower over bath.  both the bathroom and bedroom were immaculately clean.   The bed was very comfortable to sleep in!  as we were there for 2 celebrations, the hotel had put 2 cards in our room plus a complimentary bottle of wine, which was very kind!   The room had everything we needed; air con, TV, phone, safe, fridge, hairdryer, iron and ironing board I had great difficulty choosing a hotel for our stay in San Francisco. I am so glad we opted for the Argonaut. At first I was a bit worried about the location at touristy Fisherman’s Wharf, expecting hordes of tourists and rampant crime, however the Argonaut is located at the end of the Wharf and stepping through the doors is like walking into an oasis of calm, with subdued lighting and cool air.  Check in was friendly and efficient. Our room was fantastic. Top floor with a bay view. It was large, quiet and cool. Everything you want after a transatlantic flight. When I’d booked I was told that a bay view room could be noisy because it faced the street but it wasn’t. The only noise was from a street jazz player, who was great.   We are an early dinner at the Blue Mermaid which                    \"},\n",

The morning sun with seeing Salesforce tower was an amazing view. Enjoyed the regency club and happy hour appetizers. The breakfast buffet at La Societe was delicious definitely more than enough. Enjoyed my time here and if you are a measum person the moma is right around the corning  The front desk staff was unprofessional and needs customer service and customer satisfaction training. I had to initiate and direct the conversation to get checked in. Also, a hotel of this type should have room service.   On a brighter note, The cafe staff was very nice and professional. The room looked really nice, comfortable bed, and good overall planning. Huge minus for very loud ventilation in the bathroom that made it hard to sleep even with a closed door to the bathroom. Bring your earplugs! The hotel was fine. Average Hyatt Regency property and room.  Good location.  I expected a lot more from the \"Club Access\" premium I paid, including the breakfast buffet which was unimpressive.  There should be no extra charge for the meager extra amenities they call Club Access. I was only in the city for 2 nights, but decided to stay here and I’m really glad I did! The location is great, there’s plenty of restaurants and stores within walking distance. The Museum of Modern Art is also super close and worth visiting. Upon walking in, I couldn’t help but notice a lovely (woody?) light scent in the lobby and the decor was simple but sophisticated and modern (both in lobby & guest room). I booked myself a corner room and the view was amazing from the 33rd floor! I had floor to ceiling windows and when I asked about a microwave, they were kind enough to bring one up to my room. The room was clean and spacious and had all the basic necessities. The market in the lobby also had some pretty good options. The carrot cake was really good and I’m glad they Nice clean rooms, great view of the city, hills, and bay from 1907 and a pretty good view in 803. the bathrooms had plenty of space and were stocked with soaps, shampoos, conditioners, and lotions. there were plenty of places to charge devices. The beds were comfortable and the AC worked very well. The gentlemen at the luggage desk? bellhops? were awesome they held our luggage for a few hours before our check in and after our check out. It was very close to Target, and the Moscone West building... actually a pretty easy walk.  My wifi did no work and I really needed it to work. The front desk staff was polite but not very helpful. Also I was given only a small water bottle which they expected to last all night. I had to go many times to refill it. I had to also call downstairs to ask how to get it refilled.  Overall the service was mediocre for a major hotel locate in downtown of a major American city. My mother and I decided to have an adventure, neither of us had ever been to the west coast before and we wanted to attend a comic book convention to meet some celebrities. This hotel was fantastic! The staff is friendly and go beyond to help you with any problem. We felt safe and all of the facility was clean and beautiful. I’d stay there again in a heartbeat! I stayed here while visiting my son for Thanksgiving. He lives in the Mission District, but the Hyatt location was perfect for museums and exploring parts of SF.  The rooms were clean, and I could view the sunsets each morning from the lovely window view.  The bed was surprisingly extremely comfortable. Additionally, I loved the fact that there were 4 fluffy pillows. That made me feel at home. The staff was extremely polite and helpful.  Will at the front desk was great during the check in process.  The staff in the Market Place were exceptional. Each morning, I went for coffee and yogurt. The Market staff remembered our conversations daily.  They truly made my day more personable each and every morning. It was easy to walk to the Ferry Building and Union Square.  Also, I used Everything was fantastic. The hotel was immaculate and lovely, and Ms. Sara was incredibly kind and helpful. I had a wonderful view of the city from my 36th-floor accommodation. In addition, I was grateful for the market ticket, which I used to buy breakfast. We are really grateful to Ms. Sara for making our anniversary stay enjoyable.  The Hyatt Regency in downtown San Francisco is in a great location, close to Union Square, China town and etc. Its rooms are relatively big but bright with large-size TV. It offers excellent service. I would not reserve to recommend it to my friends. The hotel is is in a great location and the room was in great condition. The staff was very courteous and helpful. In particular, I had to cut my trip short and they were able to waive the fee of the remaining night on my booking.  Managers need better training and should never, under any circumstances, disrespect and talk down to any guest. Getting access to my room took over 2 hours from the front entry and during this time I witnessed hotel staff and management treating staying customers  with contempt. We loved every bit of our stay here.  I had to attend a medical conference at the St. Regis although there were no more rooms available there at the preferred rate and we weren\\'t comfortable paying more than $1k for a room per night and so we opted for the Hyatt Regency SOMA which was a block away.  We were ecstatic with the quality of our room, very spacious and high quality.  Staff was attentive and helpful.  Hotel\\'s location was convenient to so many attractions including Davies Symphony Hall which we attended while visiting.  I cannot recommend this hotel more.  My wife and I will definitely return. Everything was absolutely wonderful. The staff were courteous and the hotel was clean and beautiful. I stayed on the 21st floor and truly loved the view of the city. I also appreciated the voucher for the market that was given, and used that to purchase breakfast.      Great location, awesome staff, wonderful city view. We stayed for 1 night but really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend to all friends and would stay there again on next trip. Highly recommended.  As in title happy with bed and location, nicely refreshed hotel. In the gym not all peloton bikes worked, the toaster in the morning was slow. Artisan coffees in breakfast cost extra. In the club the buffet was missing warm snacks Decidedly the bleakest most basic Hyatt I have ever encountered.  Lobby has lots of inviting sitting spaces to talk with visitors…but plays crappy knockoff pseudo-trendy music so loud you cannot carry on a conversation without shouting,  Manager refused to even consider turning it down, offering the non sequitor, “It’s a public lobby.[?!?].  Breakfast was barely above airline standards and very oddly layer out buffet.  All in all, the absolute worst Hyatt I have ever seen.  Avoid this pit until someone fires the manager.  Lobby bar is, by contrast, run by a delightful pro who knows what service is all about.  He should be managing this turkey.   Everything is good. But I think the buffet breakfast can be done better. The google evaluation for the buffet is also low. I tried once and was not happy as I ate something fruit not fresh (rotten already). The next morning I had to go to other hotels for breakfast, which is not good for you guys. Keep improving. We stay for a convention, everything its very near. The hotel is clean. There was trouble with the conecctions with TV. We recomendé it at all. Stores, restaurantes and our convention center. You could walk every place safety'},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': '                    After missing my connecting flight to Singapore, I had the \"dilemma\" of choosing a place to stay for the night.   The Ritz Carlton was my regular and favorite spot, but I noticed the Fairmont\\'s rates for the particular night were excellent.  I booked through my Virtuoso agent for $325/night with a $100 F&B credit and breakfast.  I was really excited as well because this is an iconic SF property that I always wanted to stay at since I was a kid.    Upon arrival, there was chaos.  I soon realized why - the beautifully decorated lobby.  Check-in was easy.  The property is quite big, so I had a hard time finding the elevator to the Tower rooms since nobody at the front offered me any assistance.    The room (\"Signature\") was the perfect size for one person for a one night stay.  It Excellent accommodations.  Nice that parking was included in the price.  Good value for San Francisco.  Room was very adequate for 3 of us, with two queen beds. Closet also served as a dressing room, as it was quite large.  Staff was cordial. Check in was extremely slow. After being told the room was not ready we came back later just to wait another 30 minutes in line to receive the key. The shades in the bathroom were not functional, ruined the idea of bath with a view. Windows were disgusting with hand prints. Stayed at the Fairmont San Francisco in October 2023.  The hotel is an ideal location to a lot of key attractions.   The staff at the hotel are tremendous.     The views of San Francisco Bay are outstanding. We had an exception hotel experience as we always do when we stay at The Fairmont. Our room was wonderfully luxurious and comfortable and the staff were exceptionally attentive and professional. This is only hotel we stay at when we visit San Francisco and will continue to be so in the future. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Nice hotel in a great location on San Francisco Nobb Hill. Specially good if you book thru Amex Fine Hotels because you get $100 food and beverage credit and $100 towards breakfast for each room. Plus we got an upgraded room in the Tower. Whilst clearly highly regarded by Americans, and with a fascinating, rich history with hosting past and current Presidents and celebrities, The Fairmont Hotel is a very disappointing member of the Accor brand for international travelers. As Platinum ALL members, our suite was upgraded before we arrived to one with a magnificent view, but that was one of only a handful of positive experiences. After 20+ hours of air-travel from Perth, Western Australia (luckily we stopped in beautiful Fiji, at Accor’s Sofitel Denarau), including crossing the international date line, enduring Homeland security checks/passport dramas at the airport, difficulty finding our driver etc, we arrived absolutely exhausted and to find an extremely busy front driveway entrance and foyer (clearly a local This was our first time staying at the Fairmont and probably won\\'t stay again. The hotel\\'s website is definitely showing Christmas photos from sometime ago. Overall, the hotel feels tired and rundown. I don\\'t think I spotted a single Christmas decoration that didn\\'t have at least half of the lights burn out. Extension cords were visible everywhere with tags still on them. Attention to detail was definitely lacking. Getting your car at valet took 30 mins. The pillows were probably the worst hotel pillows I\\'ve ever experienced. They look fluffy, but then turn into slabs of concrete. The Tonga Room felt like a frat party. It\\'s sad because you can tell at one point this hotel was the height of sophistication, but it\\'s sadly been run down by tourists just looking for a quick Beautiful hotel and well decorated for the holidays!  We always come back to San Francisco for the holidays and the Fairmont celebrates the season and the city like no other!  The room was very specious and comfortable.  The bathroom was very modern for a historic hotel. I’d booked a Signature Room for the view and wasn’t disappointed. A big shout out to Cameron who warmly greeted me at check-in and sorted out a room on the top floor with an amazing view of the bay. He also made sure I knew where everything was and advised me that the dining was an early experience in the area.  The room was very comfortable and clean, recently renovated I would imagine, and had some fine toiletries in the spacious bathroom.   The experience at the Fairmont Hotel on Mason Street in San Francisco is exquisite. The lobby area is stunning. You step into the hotel and feel like you have stepped into a magical Christmas movie. The life-sized Gingerbread house, the Christmas tree - all of the decorations are stunning. The staff is friendly and interact with their guests in a positive way. Have a problem? They are there to fix it! The rooms are spacious and quiet. (The windows don\\'t have screens on them, so it\\'s good to keep little ones from opening them). I appreciated that your room is cleaned daily without having to be put on a \"clean daily\" list. Room service is quick and reliable.  It\\'s not a cheap stay, but it is one that you\\'ll enjoy and remember. Extremely close to lots of attractions - trolleys are Stayed for a work conference and enjoyed the Tonga Room, the outside terrace, the ballrooms.  I had a corner room which was massive and light filled in the main building on the 5th floor and had an excellent city view.  All the staff I interacted with were impeccable. The life size gingerbread house means the lobby is filled with the smell of gingerbread, the christmas tree and tea room were gorgeously decorated. the champagne bar in the lobby felt festive.  perfect place to spend some time at the holidays! This hotel is located in the Nob Hill neighborhood with the dramatic hills surrounding the hotel. Came in December when it was decked out with the handmade gingerbread Victorian structure (takes 520 hours to build, 8,000 gingerbread bricks. 50 gallons of egg whites, 1000 powdered sugar and 2,000 lbs of candy!). Property has a pretty garden fountain in the back. Two restaurants onsite. I did breakfast in one of the locations and it good. I had a corner king sized room on the 5th floor. Nice views of the city at night. Great customer service as well. Valet parking onsite and champagne tree! I needed to make adjustments to my hotel reservation. I called in-house reservations and spoke with Joan. I was grateful for Joan\\'s wonderful customer service. She went above and beyond in helping me with my room and restaurant reservations. Joan is a terrific asset to your Fairmont San Francisco team. Thank you Joan, I appreciate all that you\\'ve done for me.   ANN Great holiday vibe at a classic sf hotel. Parking (once you found the entrance on Powell) was very efficient, the room was very large. Checking in and out was a breeze, with lots of polite and efficient front desk folk to handle the crush. Given how popular the Fairmont is, getting a good sized room for the price was good value. The only negative was the mediocre $60 buffet, which you couldn’t opt out of. There were just a few things to choose from. The setting for this iconic hotel and the exceptional service provided by every staff member we encountered made for an especially memorable stay.  Sitting atop Nob Hill in this beautiful city, the Fairmont in San Francisco qualifies as a world class experience.  Best Ever Ok Fairmont experience. Not really up to their standards. Lobby is ok even during Xmas. Lobby bar needs improvement not sure I would return here at all if it wasn’t for business meetings and conferences  We stayed during Thanksgiving week. The hotel was decorated for Christmas and the lobby was absolutely beautiful. Highly recommend this Hotel. Had a drink at the Tonga room which was very fun. The rooms were clean and recently refreshed. This was our 4th time staying and we will be back Great location in the City! The Holiday decorations were beautiful! All staff was very helpful and friendly! Would highly recommend this hotel to celebrate an event or Holidays! Had a great time with comfortable surroundings! We enjoyed staying at Fairmont again.  Great location and walking distance to Fisherman’s Wharf and Chinatown.  Friendly staff at the hotel and prompt service.  I enjoyed celebrating my birthday back in July and again our anniversary here at the hotel again.                      '},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': \"                    Had the most wonderful experience at the Stanford Court San Francisco! The highlights were the beautiful beautiful , spacious room, comfy king size bed with wall to wall windows looking out at the city, huge bathtub with the most unreal view of the city.. with a record player, amazing records to chose from and even a candle to set the mood! The bathroom is so lavish! Everything from the ceilings to the crown molding and the pretty wood floors just simply beautiful! The guest service from Averelle was so wonderful and he was beyond helpful, can’t thank him enough!! We will remember this special stay forever because of him! THANK YOU! Come stay here!! I originally thought my last stay was great....this one topped it all. It started off a bit rocky as the room I checked into faced the hotel next door and I was not informed about it. I came back down to the desk and saw the same man who checked me in the last time I stayed at the hotel (Averell is the correct spelling) and he was able to assist me with his colleague Monet. They figured out my birthday recently passed and me and my partner was celebrating our honeymoon. I wish I took photos because the room I was switched to was spectacular! It was bigger than my apartment! They put us in the presidential suite for our stay, and the kitchen also brought us wine! Words alone could not fully describe this stay, but this has confirmed that this is the hotel I will come to when I This hotel is definitely worth a stay! The front desk employee was exceptionally friendly and informative. It's been a while since l've been to the city and he was so kind to recommend some restaurants and venues. I wish I had stayed longer, but I will definitely return to this great hotel! Former SF resident that lived in Nob Hill for 12 years. I stay here almost exclusively when I am back in town. The location is perfect, the rates and quality of the rooms make for the best value in the City, and the customer service is top-notch.   Just last week, my wife and I stopped in for an evening and they provided a free upgrade to a top floor suite, just as thanks for our loyalty.   Highly recommended. Excellent and modern hotel within walking distance to Union Square and other attractions. The rooms are clean and comfortable with helpful staff, especially Aleksandra, and casual dining that is good for families.  Huge hotel, on a hill, just below the more famous Fairmont. Stunning neighbourhood, and great walks down to Union Sq, China Town, or Bay area if you have the stamina. The bed in our Deluxe Queen Room was small, but the room was very clean, had all the amenities, and a great view over the road. We ate one night at the bar – good food and atmosphere. The breakfast cost was extortionate for what it was serving and for the poor quality of some of the items. E.g. I do not know what kind of eggs were used and how were they made into a solid paste which I suppose was a local recipe for scrambled eggs. Even at the price of $36pp, the boiled eggs and some cans of Coke were to be paid extra. Very good service though. We booked here to celebrate our 15 year anniversary. We started out with an early check in as we drove into town early. The staff were so pleasant and helpful from valet to concierge. We were given an upgrade for the night and it truly made this day even more special. I would stay here again and again.  From our first point of contact when I called the hotel to ask if they might help to make my husband's birthday special, the staff at Stanford Court delivered above and beyond. I wasn't sure what to expect after seeing the renovation photos. It looked so new and modern--not what I remembered having stayed there decades ago as a classic hotel. However, upon arriving, I admired the newly updated design and the staff treated us like VIP guests.   When I had called a few days earlier to ask if they could help to make my husband's birthday special, I had the nicest conversation with the front desk concierge and he said he would make sure that we had a celebratory bottle of wine waiting and insured that we would have a nice view. Maybe being nice as a guest also helps because he Great hotel, big room, great facilities and excellent location.  Staff was cheerful and pleasant!  Food for breakfast was very good and served fast! The wait staff was attentive and efficient.  Clean and room make up staff was prompt. The Concierge and Bellhops were great too! This hotel is the best. My wife and I went for an anniversary trip. The staff was amazing gave us complimentary breakfast and wine for the room. Truly an amazing stay. The room was amazing and with a veiw!                      This establishment fell far short of expectations. The rooms were noisy, lacking a basic amenity - a wardrobe. Service left much to be desired: wrinkled shirts, a poorly cleaned room, and a 35-minute wait for valet parking. Front desk assistance was sorely lacking. Given the steep price, I cannot in good conscience recommend this hotel. Seek alternatives for a superior experience. Great value and location for money. Clean, tasteful rooms. Upgrade to a view definitely worth it. Free coffee/tea all day. Attentive staff. Very easy access by motor vehicle - not street-side, which is a nightmare in SF. Would book here again. I arrived early and was immediately checked into a larger room with no extra charge. The location is amazing next to the tram and close to the bus. The room was very large and the bed very comfortable.  Wonderful service, and great location right on Nob Hill next to the Mark Hopkins (The Top of the Mark), the Fairmont, and a number of top restaurants, as well as on the Powell cable car line, just above Union Square and Chinatown. The manager made my husband's 50th birthday extra special with a room with a view. The bed was amazing too and quiet location. Thank you! Great location.  Good food at the bar and at breakfast. We were treated very well and all employees very helpful and nice.  The lack of stars is purely due to the quality of sleep or lack of.   Quite simply, the room windows were inadequate for their position, i.e we heard traffic noise / cable car noise when trying to get sleep after a long flight. The  rooms need double or triple glazing.  Having visited many major cities around the world, noise is inevitable but others seem to try and block this out best they can, personally I felt this wasn’t the case for this room, but a room on a different side may be totally different. We arrived tired and hungry and our check in with Ray and Armando was friendly and welcoming.  The Stanford Court is located  where the Cable Car lines cross at Powell and California Street and it is at the perfect pivot point to explore San Francisco in all directions. You can also take the #1 Calif Bus up from the BART station on Sacramento Street and get off at Mason and walk along Huntington Park for 1 block and turn Left and walk 1 block down Calif St.  Our room was pleasantly decorated and it felt fresh and comfortable. It had quiet air conditioning, but we were thrilled that all of the modern windows opened for fresh air.  The Bar/Restaurant in the lobby serves a delicious menu of comfort food and it has a wide assortment of beer on tap in a settling that makes for nice Overall we had no complaints.   The room was huge, lots of space to hang clothes. Large comfortable bed. Very clean.   The bathroom decor was a little dated but nothing so terrible as to put me off from staying there again.    The location of the hotel  is good and in a very safe area of the city. A tram stops right outside the hotel which is really cute.   The staff were friendly enough. We didn’t eat in the hotel so I can’t review that.   We would stay here again. We were checked in by Averelle who was very friendly and helpful and a great ambassador for the hotel.  Our room was really large as was the bathroom.  There was street car noise from the cable cars but it did not stop us from sleeping.  The first night we had chicken wings at the bar which were really good.  The breakfast was also really nice here.  This is a much safer and quieter area of SF but it is quite a walk up some serious hills to get out for dinner or to the shops.  We used to walk down to union square and Uber back for $9-$10 dollars.  We would stay here again but would request and inside courtyard room which are quieter. Great stay! Rooms were impeccable and the view was better than expected. The staff at the front desk were super friendly and knowledgeable. I particularly loved the restaurant style with plush seating and romantic ambiance.  Great stay in  San Francisco. Good location for all the sights, just be aware that it's at the top of the hill, but the tram stops literally at the front of the hotel. Very close to Chinatown. Lovely rooms and facilities. Friendly and helpful staff\"},\n",

The free breakfast was a plus. The only thing I hoped to see was coffee being available after the breakfast hours. I have always been a fan of Hyatt but this Hyatt is second to none. I was greeted warmly, I needed a place to grab lunch and they had 3 different suggestions. They even drew me a map. That was the start of an amazing stay. They greeted me every day and assisted me with anything and everything I could ever need. The room was very comfortable and also very clean. Staff was very helpful and professional. When I checked I was given information about the breakfast buffet the availability of the restaurant and if I needed anything to let the front desk know. Stayed here on a work trip. The hotel was in a great location close to Caltrain station and other transportation. The lobby, common areas, and breakfast area were all immaculate and well-kept. The room was spacious and up-to-date. The bathroom had plenty of towels. Housekeeping was available every day. Plenty of places to eat within walking distance and Doordash was super fast.  The only thing that would have made it better is if coffee would have been available earlier for people who are traveling somewhere to work. It takes a while to get anywhere in the Bay area so you have to get out early. Very nice hotel. Good location for visiting nearby family. The hotel was very clean and nicely decorated. The staff were helpful and welcoming. I had an issue with the first room and the front desk immediately moved me to another room. The breakfast was very good and the staff kept the buffet clean and stocked.  This beautiful hotel is less than a block from the baseball stadium and a walkable distance to Chase Center. The staff is fantastic, and they are friendly and helpful! And the full breakfast is an excellent way to start the day. They have parking on-site at $80/night OR less than a block away for $30/night. There was a lot with a charging station, but that lot was closed on Sunday. I don't know the cost of that one.  it was good. you have potential to do better. loved the breakfast. great location. good service from staff. great lounges and heating. interior was really nice and well thought for the value. not sure why windows dont open? thats it. The ambience of the hotel was relaxing. The rooms spacious and clean and the staff was exceptional. The included breakfast was a cut above the average. The location of the hotel was convenient to ATT Park and a ten minute walk to Chase Center Very convenient location. We drove there and spent the weekend. I recommend parking at the Beacon lot, it was  30 per night. Free breakfast was nice and the location was so clean. Front desk was very helpful. The room had a good view and would go back again. The staff were kind and helpful. However, The lack of agency about the bathroom lighting by having a motion sensor light that you could not turn off was a customer unfriendly choice that makes me unsatisfied with the room and the consideration of guest's varying needs. If you had the option to turn it on or off that would be fine but it was mandatory and hence unacceptable to me. I hated being blinded by bright white light in the middle of the night.  Also check the SF Giants schedule if you are not there for the game, it makes getting anywhere by car within  half a mile very slow on home game day or night.                                          \"},\n",

Amazing location, great inclusions in each room (nice products on offer, and was tempted to buy a robe - something that rarely happens!), extremely friendly and helpful staff throughout my stay.  This is the third time I have visited San Francisco and previous visits had me resigned to accepting that all affordable hotel rooms in this city are on the small side (let\\'s say around 195 square feet on average), and even when paying a bit extra for a larger room, there is not that much more space offered. That was until I entered my Executive King room in the Axiom hotel, which changed my mind! This room is just over 320 square feet, with the extra space allocated mostly to a small living area complete with a couch, coffee table, and second TV. It feels like a standard sized hotel room in other major cities.  Here\\'s my overall assessment of the Axiom:  Location: The Axiom\\'s location is prime, with the Cable Car turnaround just outside as well as the Powell station underground Overall nice and very clean hotel, with great location. However they charge 42$ dollars ‘Resort fee’ on top of the room price, which is a lot! Often this extra fee is “hidden” when you book through 3rd part websites so watch out. I was not aware of that (coming from Europe) and I was a bit disappointed when I needed to pay extra. Apart from that, there is a hotel cafe in the lobby but they do not provide any discount for hotel guests which was a disapponting. In general it seemed a bit like the hotel only cares about making money and not really about treating its guests. Much too expensive for the poor quality of the hospitality. Only positive is the convenient location. Service is minimum with unexperienced junior staff. Cleanliness was borderline ... and finally I met a beggar in the lobby in the morning. A bit surprising to be honest ...  The hotel was nice, it was clean and had a cool vibe. But I requested a room with a desk, but could not access the desk because the bed prevented me from pulling the chair out. I was in town for a conference and I had work to do I had to and had to rearrange the bed to sit at the desk.  Our stay at the Axiom in San Francisco was a true delight. From the moment we entered our huge, stylishly designed room we felt right at home, it was impeccably cleaned each day and had all the amenities you would need. The attentive staff went above and beyond, ensuring every need was met with a genuine smile. Located in the heart of the city, it provided easy access to renowned attractions, making our exploration seamless. In summary, this hotel surpassed our expectations, making our time in San Francisco truly memorable and we will definitely return My girlfriend and I stayed in this hotel for four days on vacation in the bay and it was a great experience. The hotel was clean the location was perfect. We were near a lot of attractions and stores on marlet street. The cable car was right outside the door and subway station is a few meters away. Only complaint would be noise could be heard from outside but overall a comfortable stay. Wonderful little hotel and location. Close to Union Square and the Moscone Center and right in front of the Powell cable car station. Very clean! Their local caffé has great food as well. Room was dark and quiet! Located at the foot of the cable car turnaround on Market St. and Powell, this small and hip hotel is a great stay in SF.  The staff are also great!  Highly recommended.  The beds are super comfy and the rooms are quiet and well amentized. Great hotel! Super modern and quaint. Loved the library feel and front desk sitting area. My only small complaint was that there wasn’t a great place to place my things and there was a very very strong smell of cleaning fluids for most of the 2.5 days we were there.  This hotel was better than I expected! Out the gate, I got an upgrade to a King room and discovered that this place has later checkout than your normal 11am time. Check-in was a breeze and the hallways though dark were very clean. The room was big enough for what we needed it for and the best part was seeing my name on the TV upon entry. Quite impressive though was \"Astro\" a robot butler who brought us towels when we discovered we had none upon returning to the room. Filtered water everywhere, a cool recreation floor and a cafe right in the lobby. It was all I asked for and I look forward to returning.  We very much enjoyed our stay at The Axiom Hotel.  The location was great, convenient to walking anyplace in the city, a couple of blocks from Union Square.  The room was good size, with a nice seating area and a very comfortable king-size bed.  The bathroom was spacious, though storage space for clothing was less than we expected.  The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful.  We will stay at The Axiom Hotel on our next visit to SF. I felt like the pictures on the website were slightly misleading. The room was very small; there was not a lot of space for two people. Additionally, we had a room that faced inside the hotel (kind of like a courtyard without the courtyard). So, the view was of another hotel room. While the view didn’t bother me, the lack of sunlight did. Even on sunny days, the room was so dark as no natural light was getting in. The pictures online depict bright, sunny rooms. One night, cleaning staff didn’t provide any towels. It was an easy fix, but a little annoying for the price. The bed was not comfortable; the middle of the bed was sunk in. The pillows were also flimsy. Location is convenient. There is 24/7 valet. The hotel was quiet and clean. However, I wouldn’t stay there again. Great location, comfortable room, nice service, good breakfast in the lobby cafe! The only negative thing was the airconditioning, they put a moblie unit in the room as the central aircon does not work. good value for money! This is the best boutique hotel in San Francisco right on the cable car line and the BART station line at Powell St. Its very cute and quaint. Nicely appointed rooms. They also have a small cafe. The food at breakfast I thought as very good This is my third stay.  They have a gym. The prices are excellent but you need to call for more details. This is the best hotel in town. The staff were amazing, the room was above expectations . Location was magnificent, walkable distance to dining options,  outlets and China town. I will definitely recommend this hotel.  Excellent boutique hotel. The location is perfect to the BART Powell st station. The cable car tracks and waiting lines are right outside the door. The prices are amazing. I stay in a smaller room which is perfect for my use. Very nicely appointed bathroom and shower. HD TV. They have a small breakfast cafe. The vegetable egg omelette is perfect. They have a gym but I never used it it’s so close to shops and union square. Clean and comfortable beds, good access to downtown San Francisco. and kind front staff. I plan to use this hotel when I visit San Francisco again. I was able to use a good accommodation for a comfortable trip. I recently stayed at the Axiom Hotel in San Francisco. The staff were friendly and went above and beyond to ensure our stay was easy and relaxing. The hotel was very clean and the beds and pillows were very comfy. The location was right at Union Square. Excellent access for the Muni to take us to the Chase Center and Oracle Park with ease. Lots of great restaurants nearby and the Cable Car depot was right outside the hotel doors for a famous ride down to the warf, pier 39 and famous Lombard Street. Highly recommend the Axiom as a great place to stay oin the city. Kristene  Hotel is located very centrally with two entrances and has a very nice lobby with option to self check in. Rooms are comfy and clean, with spacious bathroom. Fitness option included, which we really enjoyed & thought is a nice perk (water & towel service included). I‘d totally recommend the hotel to friends!                                        '},\n",

NOTHING about it in any fine print I read. And what are you going to do, standing at the check-in counter trying to use a reservation you made months ago. Great room, club level, very poor standards! The standards in the end club are no longer worth having. The food is awful by and large and people wander in without even having their cards checked for club privileges.  People wandering around in their pajamas at breakfast wearing house slippers! It’s absolutely atrocious, I’ve seen better dressed people at Walmart.  Evening staff in the lounge were incredible, breakfast crew awful. Asian lady on duty mostly hiding in the kitchen. The milk had run out 30 minutes ago, then she appeared , moved a few plates around and left again. Terrible experience, Marriott no longer cares about premium members!  I haven’t been here since 2019 and the standards have dropped through the flow. Do better Marriott… And by the way, beware the $25. I was confirmed for 2 nights and I\\'m a reward member. They overbooked and I was \"walked.\" Sent to a less than comparable property about 1 mile away and was told to walk myself there. Without proper explanation, lack of empathy, and zero remorse for the inconvenience to me and my work trip, this has left a very bad impression of Marriott. In addition, the young staff member who asked me to leave was curt and rude when I asked him to explain what was happening. He kept repeating himself and saying, \"As I already explained, the hotel is oversold.\" While that may have been a fact, that was his administrative burden to bear and I expect a better solution from a corporation like Marriiott. He said he was mirroring my attitude, which was warranted after flying across the country and We visit this property annually for the Fan Expo, which is only a short walk away. We have never been dissatisfied. The interior of the property is great. The lobby is large, bright and always beautifully decorated for Christmas. The rooms have a coffee maker, fridge and microwave. The rooms are also tastefully decorated and well organized. But what makes a special impression on me is the service. From check in to the gift shop, every employee was friendly and helpful. Special kudos to Sabina at check in (who gave my daughter a small box of chocolates at check in) to Alfonso at the bell desk (who had some thoughtful suggestions on where in town to take my daughter during our visit), the staff was on point.  The hotel offered special rates for those attending the Fan Expo and I This was a life time stay at the grand hotel of Marriott San Francisco in city downtown.  We stayed for a few days during our visit in the city.  This was a great hotel with large lobby and multiple elevators and levels.  The rooms a big and ample comfortable to stay. Service was good, since lots of fellow Filipino you meet around the hotel.  Check-in and check-out was fast and easy.   Thankful for the return of phone we lost in the lobby, fortunately it was returned through the Lost and Found office lady.  Maraming Salamat!   Nice to meet lady from Capiz, cashier in the hotel snack bar.  To everyone who made our stay safe and enjoyable.  Thanks. Hotel is large and somewhat impersonal in its public spaces. Has very much the feel of a conference hotel, not one for a romantic weekend away! My first room was right outside the service elevator shaft so I had to ask to be moved. The second room was much quieter. Rooms are a good size, with firm beds and well-appointed bathrooms. For a largish hotel, the elevators were fast and efficient too. The bar on the top floor was also good. I took advantage of the M Club as part of our rate, which meant a free breakfast and the option of snacks in the evening. The breakfast options were plentiful and tasty. Overall for a large hotel, it was a pleasant enough experience, although I missed having a swimming pool. Surprised at how terrible this hotel’s service is. Being a Titanium Elite/Ambassador member, this hotel really doesn’t appreciate or recognize loyalty and believes in zero customer care.   While the overall service is poor, they also lost a couple of expensive laundry items and just ignored it after numerous follow ups (both in the hotel and after my departure as well) with Mia (who said it won’t happen again ), Benji (who hasn’t even responded), and Ellen (who looks after rooms).  Having stayed at hundreds of properties globally over the years, it’s hard to find a hotel with shoddier service anywhere in the world. More than shoddy, there’s such a lack of care for guests that it makes you want to check out as soon as you can. While I will never stay here again due to their lack Based on reviews I expected so much more. Rooms are a good size but have nondescript decor. This is a megahotel that caters to large conferences so you will be anonymous and lost in a sea of people.  You will be nickeled and dimed for everything including a mandatory $25 resort fee. Sure, you can use the resort fee towards purchases in the grab and go commissary but when a large bottle of water is $9 (more than at the airport!), what’s your real purchasing power. My internet was terrible and I couldn’t even logon to do work. Finally I was charged $15 for a box that was delivered to me there. I’ve never been charged a delivery fee.  Stay somewhere else with more personality that has basic services included in the base hotel price. Unfortunately like most of San Fransciso, the hotel is located in an area with a lot of homeless people, trash and just not welcoming for visitors.  The facilities themself were very nice.  The room was spacious enough, very clean and a nice shower.  The buffet breakfast was pricey but exceptional (the donuts were wonderful).  Staff was helpful and check in was a breeze (although they do put a hold on your CC which was released within a day after we checkout).   Problem is once you take a step outside you\\'re in a whole different world.   I stayed here for a large conference.  We had a standard room with two queen beds which was excellent.  This hotel is located near the Powell Street BART station and there are a  lot of restaurants in the area.  The meeting facilities were excellent/  I would recommend this hotel for anyone planning a large event in San Francisco. Excellent Experience. The renovations are great. The hotel is beautiful and located with within walking distance to the Gaslamp District and the ocean.    The room was clean with incredible views of the city. Great pool and Starbucks and other food options located on the property.   The best part of my experience was the customer service from staff across the board. Thank you Rene, Dave, Martiza, Andy and valet team.  Highly Recommended! Great Stay....I was starting to doubt the Marriott band since covid shut everything down.  Those of us that have continued to travel, have experienced closed restaurants, no housekeeping, no perks for bonvoy Platinum Elite members.  Very low expectations at hotels.  Marriott Marquis San Francisco has restored my faith in the Marriott brand.  Great service, no problems during my 5 night stay.  The perks of breakfast /evening happy hour on the second floor was great for Bonvoy members.  The large security staff is required for this city as the homeless and mentally ill continuing attempt to enter the property.  I saw no less that 5 security people ensuring a safe environment at the hotel entrance/lobby.  Target store across the street with a Walgreens around the block.  Valet Very disappointed to have $25 daily fee plus tax forced on us.  You can use it for food and drink credit but restaurants and shops have ridiculous exorbitant prices.  Disappointed in you, Marriott. No mention of this when we booked.  We won’t be back. Pleasant and efficient staff, Reasonable room layout, terrible room placement (Alley view) on 7th floor.  We got this room, because the hotel did not book us into a king room as requested.  Avoid the Blue section of the hotel.  Hotel cost (nearly $400/night including taxes) would have suggested a premiere room rather than the room we received.  The latest checkout that was offered was 12:30 PM, which really did not help with our schedule, and really made no sense as I noted staff cleaning rooms on our hall as late as 4PM during the week.  What a dump is a war zone! This place has been ripping off for years. Karma is real.  The owner of this place has git to be taking a bath now. The money grab is over. Horrible property! Horrible staff. Poor management.  As an Ambassador they tried to charge me $400 to accept my Amazon packages.  Poor wifi A/C didn\\'t work. TV was snow. Call 0 and no one picks up the phone. Beds are old.  I hate this dump!!!! Recently stayed at this enormous hotel on a very busy weekend.  Overall I enjoyed it. My room faced inward which wasn\\'t that great because the air vents on the lower roofs were quite noisy.  Thus I didn\\'t open the windows much to enjoy the miraculous San Francisco summer weather. (Bring a sweatshirt as nights are chiily even in August.) Nonetheless, the seal on the windows was sound proof, so the room was pretty silent when the window was closed.   The hotel sports an excellent gym with an entire floor dedicated to cardio.  Really the gym was huge and not too crowded.  That was great. There is a $25 destination/resort fee.  But don\\'t worry as it translates to a credit at hotel restaurant or even better at the Market Place store in the hotel. Hint: If you purchase $18 of stuff in I love when I get to stay here. I can’t usually afford it but when I’ve stayed here it’s always been wonderful. The rooms are great the staff is professional and the location couldn’t be more perfect. The hotel is nice in many respects and the staff is competent and friendly. Also, it is worth noting that the fitness center is quite incredible, possibly the biggest and best I\\'ve ever seen in a hotel.  The main challenge is about the rooms facing the back. The view is rather poor but, frankly, that is not as big of an issue. The big issue is that trash dumpsters are in that area and the trash trucks come in the worst possible hours (e.g., 3:00 AM and 6:00 AM during my stay) and are extremely loud, making it practically impossible to get good sleep.  Great experience at the hotel. Was able to web checkin, arrived early and immediately offered a room. Request for late checkout was granted with no fuss. Staff provided very good service. Facilities were clean and room was serviced regularly. Went for drinks at The view lounge and was really impressed by the view (from the 39th floor) the bar snacks are clearly priced (how ever) the drinks aren\\'t and although your paying for the view $19 for a glass of wine is a little rich . We opted to pay cash and were a little disappointed when asked to pay the bill before we were ready to leave  Emailed the hotel on 26th July, to receive an automatic reply: Please note this email box is not monitored regularly. If your matter is urgent please call the hotel directly at 415-896-1600.  WHAT A JOKE! Is this a first world country or?  Contacted the hotel via Facebook, and after telling them my inquiry, was again asked to call! Nice, seems like the hotel doesn\\'t realise there\\'s international customers, and different timezones.   Will never stay here again! The hotel is huge & lovely. Spacious lobby with access to Mission & 4th streets. Good rooms. The service is inconsistent - some staff members were warm while some did not wear a customer hat. While the breakfast arena & service were good, the spread can be worked on. I am an elite member and if I leave a review, it’s because my experience was NOT good.  Sadly the 5 star reviews are just not indicative of how Marriott guests get treated.  I called and on Bonvoy indicated no tub rooms, with view.  Not only that was ignored, they have no sense of customer service.  I’ve stayed in Marriott for months at a time and now I am giving them no more of my business,  airbnb is the only way I’m traveling- big corporations don’t care to train on customs service.  After pandemic nothing is good with Marriott hotels.   Don\\'t go to this hotel, they dont know what they are doing.  Service staff enter our room without warning at 8am + Our key card was cancelled during our stay and we had to spend one hour discussing with staff just to regain access to our room.    We got 25 usd discount for the B55 restaurant, the waiter said we should pay with card so we ended up not be able to use the discount.   I have been travling all over the world for decades and this hotel is by far the worst i ever have experienced.  I travel a few times a year for work. It seems most of the hotels I stay at are Marriott. This location was good. No real complaints. Check in went pretty fast even though there was  a line. The elevators confused me a little as I was on the 7th floor and you have to find the \"blue elevators\" that are kind of behind the others. Not a big deal. Just had to figure it out. The bathroom fan did hum all night and my colleague said the same thing happened in their room. I was able to tune it out after I fell asleep. Overall, I would stay here again. We did a 3-day weekend getaway to San Francisco and truly enjoyed our stay at the Marriott Marquis. We arrived on an overnight flight from Hawai\\'i and were so thankful we could get an early check-in. Everyone we encountered from Housekeeping, Front Desk, the bars and restaurants were so kind and provided great service. We loved the View lounge for snacks and drinks along with great food and drinks in Bin55. We\\'ll definitely be back and thank you to everyone at the Marriott Marquis for an amazing weekend vacation. Clean hotel in a good location near to transport and union square. Room was spacious and well equipped. Would have been nice to have a pool in the hotel. Breakfast was very expensive so eat elsewhere. Good bet it you want a central location and clean spacious room. Pretty much the title. HVAC didn’t work. There was a water leak in the room. Beds and pillows were pretty uncomfortable. And when I called the front desk to ask for a 30 minute extension on my checkout, they refused and hung up the phone on me when I asked if they can do it as a courtesy given the terrible conditions. I will never again stay in this hotel and strongly recommend others avoid it. The stay was amazing! I love the space and the view. The blanket on the bed is really cold though. We had kept asking the lobby office for a warmer one but they kept giving us the same thing. I got really cold at night. Other than that, I completely love the hotel. We stayed here for 2 nights and everything was fantastic! The bell staff were extremely friendly and gave us quick tips and suggestions anytime we were headed out. The rooms were clean and the front desk staff always had a smile. We really enjoyed the rooftop bar experience!                     '},\n",

He stayed here when he visited from San Diego. It did not disappoint us. Counter staff miss Grace B was extremely polite and friendly, helped us to find two connecting rooms for our family of 4. The rooms were clean, the beds were very comfortable, the aircons were working well . The hotel was next to fisherman wharf and within walking distance to various tourist high lists like the fame cable car turn-around, China town etc etc. we will definitely stay in this hotel if we revisit in future I have stayed in too many hotels across the world on business that were not memorable but this one is  ……the staff were fabulous.  But there was one person who was just outstanding Jennifer the Concierge nothing was too much trouble and she got us into restaurants that were not taking bookings sourcing something to take home to my Nephew she went over and above. The overall stay was a very pleasant one. The general location of the hotel was excellent. Just a quick ~5-minute walk, and you are at the wharf. The hotel provides paid parking, which is a norm across, and you can keep the car even after checkout, depending on when you checked in.  The room we stayed in was on the 5th floor, and outside the window, we did not have any great view, but have to say it was also not blocked by any buildings. The hotel had a restaurant in its lobby, and it was reasonable. However, you also have many options nearby in walking distance. We loved our stay and the hospitality from the hotel. I was just staying here for Outside Lands and this was a great stay. The staff was super accommodating of all of my request and explained everything I had questions about. The location was great for walking and there was easy access to trolley cars if you wanted to hop on one and go around the city. The hotel restaurant/room service didn’t have many vegan options, but they were accommodating to the best of their ability. Hotel is super clean and I felt safe walking around the area at night as a female solo traveler. Would definitely stay here again if I ended up going to the festival next year. A great two night stay at this Marriot property. Perfectly located near Fisherman's Warf tourist area and water. The restaurant was pricey, but there are plenty of good food venues nearby.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  We also liked the secure parking.  I mean who’s writing these reviews this place is a total dump. Old worn out rooms with beyond rude customer service. Being an platinum elite Marriott member I thought we would give this location a try since we were passing though SF with our pets and boy did I make a mistake.   Very comfortable room and friendly staff. Hotel charges a destination fee, but the only one we stayed at, which gives a lot of benefits for it. Restaurant staff was excellent. Our granddaughter has food allergies. They brought her food directly from kitchen to prevent cross contamination at the buffet. Restaurant manager Alex and the staff Alfonso, Carolina, Eric, Bharti, Connie and Amy made our 7 day stay very enjoyable. Let me say, one of the best hotel experiences!  The customer service was wonderful and the dining team was outstanding! Connie, Alfonso, and Eric were just the best and when we come back to San Francisco, the Marriott Fisherman’s Wharf will be our first choice! We are locals who are in the middle of a kitchen remodel. A friend who was going to host us for a week came down with Covid, so we shopped around for local hotels and got a really nice deal at the Marriott on the wharf. It's about 3 miles away from our home.  You should know that many if not most locals never spend time up at the wharf voluntarily - only when dragged there by friends from out of town. A lot of us have an attitude about it.  So I copped a bit of an attitude about staying at this hotel before we arrived. But  our stay at the Marriott ended up being just great, and (don't tell anyone) we had a lot of fun playing tourist at the wharf and on (gasp) Pier 39.   From the moment we arrived - with lots of boxes, I should say - the staff was super-accommodating. Bell staff Our stay was, nothing super special though. Great location, but all the staff were extremely surly, even with the most menial request. Having said that, we experienced that behaviour throughout all of San Fran, so it may just be par for the course!! The staff made our stay. They were friendly and eager to assist with our numerous needs. Our front desk staff Grace B. was exceptional. Very welcoming and professional. The room was clean and mattress comfortable. The location of this hotel is a short walk to fishermans wharf and cable cars. I recommend  John Seccli at the  concierge service desk was kind, informative and helpful. John was able to answer all of our questions and provide fantastic activity / restaurant recommendations. Julio, the bell service attendant was also phenomenal! Julio made us feel welcomed and was great at handling our property with care. The front desk attendants were also prompt and friendly. House keeping did a great job as our room appeared spotless upon arrival. Overall, the staff and cleanliness at the San Fransisco Marriott at Fisherman's Wharf made our stay one of the best we have experienced.  Morning breakfast staffers Bharti, Carolina & Connie are the most helpful, kind & efficient staffers at the dining restaurant. They are always upbeat, greeting you with a smile, and willing to be of service for whatever I or other guests may request. I enjoy my daily breakfast experience because of them. Thank you  for that experience:-) We stayed here in mid-May 2023. We were delighted to receive an early check-in around 1 pm. The room was quiet and the bed was comfy. Front desk agents were charming and helpful throughout our entire stay. Due to being Titanium, we received full free breakfast. We used the food credit for take-away dinner from the restaurant one night; please note we went to the restaurant, ordered off the menu and returned to pick up our dinner. We noticed that had we ordered via room service, the prices for the same food would have been substantially higher. All of the restaurant staff were very gracious and they truly went above and beyond to make our meals enjoyable.  As others have noted, the location is excellent.  Easy walk to either cable car line, Lombard Street and Pier 39. About a Beware- if you use the food and beverage credit at the hotel bar it may not get applied to your total so it’s useless!!!   I will say we loved the location, how clean it was and the spacious room. This would have been a 5 star review and a place I would recommend friends to stay when visiting SF. I loved the close proximity to Fisherman’s Wharf and Ghirardelli.   They have a $30 convenience fee that includes cable car tickets, bike rentals and some other amenities. One of those is a $30 food/beverage credit at the hotel bar. We got a cocktail and a glass of wine and handed the bar tender the $30 voucher. When I signed my receipt the voucher was applied. Upon checkout the hotel has no idea what i’m talking about and are charging me the full bar bill. What is the point of this Had a very nice overnight stay as we celebrated our son’s graduation. Every single staff member we met was courteous, friendly and genuinely nice! Nowadays these basic elements of hospitality and customer service are a rarity unfortunately, but Marriott Fisherman’s Wharf made our stay exceptional. Aside from this, the location is perfect, close to many nice restaurants and attractions! The rooms and hotel lobby are clean and updated and there is an option for breakfast in their restaurant. We look forward to returning and will continue to recommend this hotel especially because of their wonderful staff! Typical Marriott property located on a leafy street in the heart of the Fisherman's Wharf/Embarkadaro area of San Francisco. The hotel is 3-4 easy blocks from the bay and all the attractions for which the area is famous: seals, aquarium, Alcatraz ferry, restaurants,bars,marinas,market etc. Easy in and out for cabs/lyft/uber. The hotel is user friendly. Easy Check in. A breakfast and lunch space in the lobby.  Rooms are comfy. Not overly spacious but plenty accommodating. Nice views. Plenty of tech plugs. Utilitarian desk. As with most hotels the lighting leaves something to be desired. Wi Fi is serviceable.  The hotel, as most upscale in San Francisco, adds on required extras whether you plan to use them or not (one way cable car passes, fishing  gear, and a coupon for $$$off I reviewed several Marriott hotels within the vicinity and was glad that I chose this one because:   * it is located in a livelier, brighter, cleaner part of the neighborhood  * within walking distance to Pier 39, Pier 33 (for Alcatraz), cable car/trams, Chinatown, Italian town  * it looks newer than Courtyard Marriott that’s just 500m away  * In & Out 🍔 is just 5 mins away * the room is spacious and very clean; the beddings are very comfortable * the amenities’ fee of $30/night is not a big issue considering that you get it back in terms of vouchers you can use to redeem f&b * the lobby lounge cum restaurant serves a good variety of drinks 🍹🍷🍺🥂and pretty good foods. Good place to chill out after night falls * need access card to enter alternative hotel entrances, toilets We stayed for 2 nights after the cruise.  Overall fit for purpose. We were grateful to be given early check in (however it was a connecting door which can cause noise from neighbour) as we only stayed so did not ask to be moved.  Excellent location easy to get around.  Room size is adequate and fit for what we needed.  Breakfast at Red Fin Restaurant very strange, open plan off the lobby, dit not feel like a restaurant.  We found very poor food quality and not good value for what was on offer at the buffet.  Destination fee increased from $ 20 + to $ 30+ which we have to queried at check out and reduced to $ 20 + by reception.                     We stayed there for one night during a trip along the West Coast. So the location is nice, you can visit Golden Gate and Waterfront but also can take the train to Downtown SFO. Rooms are nice, clean and sufficient for what you need. Service was nice and hotel offered what you want to receive. Only negative point is the parking. As they only offer valet parking  - the overall rate is a bit too high Returned to this hotel from a stay only a week ago.   The morale at this location seems positive and the room was clean and bathroom well stocked.   The main attribute to this location (for me anyway) is the front desk experience.   In that respect, Aspen (the one from Hawaii) is very good and treated me well on this visit and also my last visit --- help to make a return stay desirable. We recently spent seven nights in California and had saved our five Platinum Elite Suite Awards for this special trip — what a disappointment.  Despite requesting and receiving confirmations a month in advance of our trip at both the San Francisco Marriott Fisherman’ Wharf and the Monterey Marriott Hotel, neither hotel delivered.  Both hotels sent an email the night before our stay began indicating no suites were now available!  In San Francisco, the couple we were traveling with, who are Titanium members, had their request honored with no issue.  The San Francisco staff were very rude and did absolutely nothing to lessen the blow of this poor customer service; Monterey at least covered one night of valet and also a round of drinks in the bar and profusely apologized.  We were The location is very good and convenient. All the major tourist spots are within 30 minutes walking distance. The hotel itself is just fine with everything is at bare bone minimum. Room is probably the smallest I’ve stayed.  Two towels, one bag of black tea and one bag of herbal tea - so you are out of luck if you accidentally dropped a towel or both of you want the same tea, the wall mount hair conditional is empty, super noisy toilet and AC/heating.  The only highlight is that the room has a lot charging ports.  The staff answers your questions but I cannot say they really care. You’d expect more for a US$300 per night place.   We also had a couple somewhat unpleasant experience. When booking, we are promised a lot: good city view, higher floor and away from elevator. When we This hotel is perfectly situated in the Fisherman's Wharf area, close to many sightseeing opportunities and walkable to the entire wharf.  VERY close to Ghiradelli Square.  The hotel is updated, rooms and bathrooms relatively small, but clean and quiet.  Double paned windows do a good job with the street noise.  Bar and restaurant are nice, breakfast buffet quite good.  Only complaint is parking is crazy expensive.  Hotel was very responsive to reqests for more towels, etc. We stayed there as a party of 4 on a multi state trip to the USA and it is ideally close for Fishermans Wharf, local restaurants etc. The staff were fantastic and polite, the hotel was clean. If we needed anything extra such as coffee, extra pillows etc they delivered it immediately, The only downside was they knew we had 4 people staying so why only 3 towels? Even after the first night they cleaned the room and left only 3 towels!! We had to ring every day to get more towels!! Rooms were clean, bed was comfortable, a nice stay This hotel is perfectly located by Fisherman's wharf. We were able to walk the entire area. Rooms were clean and staff was very accommodating - originally given a small corner room for a 3 day stay; easily moved to a nice, standard room Great option at Fisherman Wharf. Good location to walk to San Francisco locations such as Pier 39, Ghirardelli Square, Fisherman’s Wharf, Lombard street.  Clean hotel and friendly staff made the stay comfortable and amenable.  Thia area can be expensive though, but it’s safe. I read the reviews and compared this hotel with the other Marriott (Courtyard) at Fisherman’s Wharf. I was willing to spend the extra dollar in order to get first class service. I was wrong. It starts with the valet which didn’t bother to help with my bags or call the bell captain. Receptionist was unfriendly. Every question I had seemed to annoy her. All I wanted was a perfect start for me and my family for our 3 week round trip in California, but clearly this is not the place for perfect. One of the concierges was nice, and one of the servers in the restaurant. The others seemed to be indifferent and miserable.  The room however was nice and housekeeping did a good job. Breakfast was only average, you get much better quality in restaurants near the hotel. Hotel room was extremely clean is one the most important things when choosing a place to stay. We had a city view and appreciated the window opening slightly for fresh air. The hotel is dog friendly and has a bar. There are lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance. The Walgreens across the street came in handy for drinks and snacks.\"},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': \"                    This hotel has everything we wanted, and it's great place to relax.  The staff went out of their way to make sure everything went well during our stay.  The location is great!  Chinatown, North Beach, and historic Portsmouth Square are nearby. Don't miss the Wells Fargo Museum a block or two away! While visiting the area we stayed at the Hilton San Francisco Financial District for 2 nights.  We were upgraded to the 20th floor which had a beautiful view of the tower.  The rooms were a good size and the wrap around desk was great. We had a room with 2 double beds, which they were queen size.  There are tons of restaurants all around the hotel, so you can easily find something to eat. There is also one in the lobby as well.  The staff was super friendly and helpful. The only issues we encountered were that the walls are paper thin and we could hear the people on both sides of us and the elevators are on the slow side (it is a high building, so that's probably why). As HHDiamond, we requested for complimentary room upgrade via the Hilton app - that Ginny responded to promptly and granted us the upgrade to a premium room with bay view on the 17th floor, that we appreciated!   Upon arrival, Shani checked us in and provided us with some info regarding HH benefits for the per day credit, in-lieu of complimentary breakfast. Check in was prompt and we were in our room a few minutes after check-in completion.  Room was 2 double bed configuration. There was also a lounging sofa. Room with bay view was fantastic, with direct line of sight to the Coit Tower and the pier where a cruise ship was docked. Views could have been more enjoyable had the windows been cleaned - that said this was nit-picking. Beds were comfy, though pillows were not sufficient A gold hilton honors upgrade is a room next to the lifts and the noisiest ice machine on the planet, so much for valuing status.   Furniture has seen better days, lots of scratches and lumps.  Windows both inside and outside dirty which is a shame as the one good thing about this property is the view.  Overall it feels more like a Holiday Inn than a 4 star Hilton property  The Hilton hotel in the financial district is average at best. The area is a bit grubby and it’s really in Chinatown as opposed to the core financial district. Elevators very very slow, rooms very dated and overcrowded with furniture. Not great. We loved our stay at this Hilton! The location was perfect for exploring the city. The lobby has great style for a fun atmosphere as soon as you enter off of Kearny. We were surprised with an upgrade to the 20th floor with an amazing bay view of Coit Tower and the bay and financial district. Unfortunately the room did not have a refrigerator, but we made due.  It did however have a pretty cool desk that ran the length of the wall windows and view, great for remote work if needed. The best part of our stay was the staff in the restaurant bar; super accommodating, friendly, and knowledgeable.  We’d stay here again without a doubt. The staff of this hotel were consummate professionals. They were warm, competent and caring. The hotel was immaculate, and our conference went off without a hitch thanks to the staff.   The food was far above average for conference food, too!  I was a little hesitant to book given the somewhat mixed reviews, but I spotted a great rate on a balcony room on the top floor, so I grabbed it. I am so glad I did!  The view was *gorgeous*, and it was also so nice to be able to sit on the balcony or just get fresh air into the room.  The room seemed quite decently-sized for SF, and was relatively well-equipped. I found the bed and bedding very comfortable.   In-room coffeemaker and hairdryer could use a little upgrade, as could soundproofing.  Staff, from front desk to housekeeping, were unusually pleasant and helpful.   In all, I had a very positive experience and would definitely return. Great location and helpful staff. The bed wasn't as comfortable as I'd prefer but ordered a bunch of extra pillows and that helped. It was hard to close the curtains since there is a large counter in front of the cord. Pretty quiet although you could hear your neighbors open and close their curtains as well as the alarm for the parking garage sometimes. I had an exceptionally wonderful experience during my stay at the Hilton San Francisco on Kearny Street.  From the cuisine in the restaurant to the comfort in my room, everything was terrific.  The staff is top-notch.  Attentive with great attitudes.  I recommend this hotel without reservation.                                          \"},\n",

Hotel is located very close to Chinatown, Fisherman´s Wharf, cable car routes, Union Square and many other ammenities and places to visit I was initially a little taken aback because upon arrival they said they didn’t have my reservation, but after some computer work, finally “found” it. I wa given a back room on a lower floor, with a poor view and shabby chairs and only a king bed. (I was with a friend)  I asked if they had local information  or a concierge and a was then directed to speak with a time share salesman, He was very young, knew nothing about the city, and seemed to be very high.   The rest of the hotel staff was very nice, they replaced the shabby chairs, they said all the rooms only had king beds, which I found odd. It had lovely clean common spaces. I did not like having to “sign in” to the gym/lounge but it was a very nice rooftop terrace, gym, hot tub, sauna, lounge. The jazz music in the It is located in a nice area, near restaurants and shops.  Room has a microwave and small fridge.  Nice large room with sofa.  Hotel is clean and well maintained.  Parking available for a fee.  Beautiful lounge available to all guests.  There is a gym, sauna, game room, and whirlpool available to all guests.  Nice and friendly staffs.  Surrounded by restaurants and great shopping all within walking distance. Fisherman’s Wharf is a Uber ride away or driving distance of about 20 minutes you can catch the Ferry to Oakland or tour Alcatraz. Wife and I stayed here for a long weekend. The location was very good. Close to shopping, multiple theaters, plenty of restaurants and walking distance to Chinatown. Hotel room was clean, spacious and comfortable. Only negative, if I had to name one, was the shower water pressure. Really not a big deal but it could have been better. The staff was always friendly and willing to help. The restaurant inside the hotel was also very good and have live jazz every weekend. Overall a very solid place to enjoy the city and many of its amenities.  Great location, super close to Union Square. Rooms are absolutely huge and feel so spacious. Bed is extremely large and super comfy. We had some free coffee/hot choc on the rooftop which was lovely. Bathroom was nice and clean. Robes in the wardrobe. Staff were helpful on the front desk. Easy to access from SF airport via the BART. Would 100% stay again :) The Donatello is a 15 story full service old style hotel near union square.  The pros: rooms are incredibly spacious - big couch and coffee table, mini bar area, desk.  There is a fitness/jacuzzi/coffee bar on the 15th floor which has complimentary coffee and a little area to read the paper which was very nice.  Valet parking at the hotel.  They have a restaurant on the second floor - and room service.  The cons- lacks the character of a boutique stay. Rooms show a little wear - chairs peeling, little paint chipped off here and there.  This would be a great place to stay with a family that craves space.  Not really the elegance of a fancy hotel and not the character or a boutique inn...sort of in the middle.  Very decent stay and nothing really to complain about but if I were Only a block from Union Square this hotel was located in a very central position.  Staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  Room was very big, comfortable and clean.  Only negative was the noise at night from the street and we were on 11th floor. Very friendly staff, clean comfy room and great location. Morning coffee was a nice surprise on the rooftop each day. The location is so close to restaurants, shopping and transportation. Felt safe walking around in this area. Thank you for the great customer service!      The front desk, customer service, housekeeping and bell service were all customer-centric, professional and wonderful! ❤️      My room was very nice, clean, spacious and all amenities made my stay comfortable.  Elene, the room housekeeper went out of her way to ensure my needs were met.       The Business Center was convenient for my printing needs & Bryant was extra helpful!      The Bell Service guys were very solicitous, helped me with the cab and Uber calls and walked me to the vehicles.        Will definitely choose The Donatello for my next stay! ❤️❤️❤️  Maria Elisa Duncan Montreal, Canada                    '},\n",

The room was large, with lovely furniture and a clean bathroom. The room was cleaned every day, towels changed, bins emptied. Good coffee machine in the room. It’s about a 30 minutes walk to Fisherman’s wharf. They have an arrangement with a couple of local restaurants where you get 10% off your meals. Buses run down Lombard street. Recommend getting a Muni day pass where you can travel on buses, trams, cable cars all day.  Very central for all the bay area easy to get about by public transport the area is safe and the hotel is clean and comfortable and the staff helpful great value for money Can be a bit noisy but that is to be expected as our rooms were at the front Dirty, noisy. Very basic room yet, the cleanliness was awful. Dirty cups, sticky dirty surfaces. Our room was over the back of. A Restaurant and Bar and was very noisy. When mentioned our feedback at check out, you got the same usual line to make out that Customer Satisfaction is of some interest, then quickly ignored and told to ‘have a nice day’!!  I’m sure there are cheaper options, to have the same experience. My husband got an extremely severe Brown recluse spider bite that the musty sofa and carpet in the living room of the suite was full of ( and probably the rest of the suite as well).. he has a hole in his arm like a bullet wound and people have lost limbs from this spider bite! Absolutely most awful experience. no room cleaning service was provided even after calling and asking for it day after day. the street outside is full of crazies screaming murder entire night and being violent.. banging on doors making everyone fear for their safety. the whole suite and especially the lift smells of damp and moisure . really unsanitary. The spider bite is so severe that we are living in absolute nightmare by the damages caused by it. absolute horror. and I had my infant with me... to We stayed for three nights here and were really pleasantly surprised. The hotel is well located close enough to walk to Presidio Park, the Golden Gate Bridge, Fisherman's Wharf and the pier for Alcatraz. We had a room towards the back which was quiet. Staff were very helpful and friendly. It felt like a very safe location. Great location with free, underground, secure parking.  We were able to walk to all of our destinations including the ferry for Alcatraz, Pier 39 and The Presidio.  We found a nice tap room near the Ghirardelli Experience.  There are plenty of dining options close to the hotel.  There is also a grocery store in walking distance. The room was clean and comfortable.  We arrived early and the hotel allowed us to park in their garage. We visited recently and cannot fault the service and staff. The bed for myself wasn't the most comfortable but must be personal preference as my partner says he didn't mind. In a really convenient place didn't take us long to get anywhere and we dropped by mel's right opposite after out visit to Alcatraz in the evening. The only thing I would say is the noise in the mornings is kind of irritating, we thought it was a one off but it happened both mornings and early when we wanted to sleep a bit later to relax, it sounded like housekeeping as they got the hoover out very early. When we left the staff couldn't be helpful enough, stored our luggage whilst we went out for the morning. The entire staff were always friendly, helpful and made us feel welcome. The entire place was clean thoroughly. Rooms were spacious, comfortable bed & pillows and nice shower. Secure on location parking. Location felt safe, comfortably walk the area. Close to numerous small restaurants with delicious food. Located on Lombard St convenient to public transportation. Reasonably priced. Great location. Friendly hotel staff. Across the street from a muni bus stop, hopped on, 15 minutes away from Fisherman's Wharf. Garage parking included with stay! Accommodations are nice. Soft bed, comfortable room, window view, I was hoping the hotel had a bathtub, so I brought along bathbubbles and it did not disappoint! Deep bath and plenty of hot water! Bathroom has a heat lamp too!! Across the street is a 24 hr Mels diner, a starbucks or Peets coffee. Everything felt close by! Hotel is currently under facade renovation but view wasn't obstructed. Would return again. My husband and I spent 5 nights at Cow Hollow Motor Inn.  The property is conveniently located near many shops and places to eat all with in walking distance.  The property is on Lombard street, and it's a very busy street with lots of traffic.  We had a room facing a parking lot, and fitness center.    The noise didn't really bother us, as we wore ear plugs.  We were on the top level and didn't hear any noise from adjoining rooms.  The beds were comfortable.  They use a flat sheet for the bottom, and it seemed quite small and didn't really cover the mattress very well.  The sheets were clean, and the pillows comfortable.  The furnishings were older but in good condition.  Wifi worked well.  The not so good:  There are no microwaves or refrigerators in the room, although a Can’t really fault it - lovely comfy rooms. Son went out gallivanting on the first night and never saw any poo! Had a lovely day down at the wharf the next day. Nice outlook - don’t pay extra for a quiet room, the AC is noisier than the traffic. Nice staff. Really enjoyed our time here. I want to share my recent experience at this hotel, which I regretfully cannot recommend. The hotel has an attractive location but is marred by a lack of basic amenities and poor customer service.  During our six-night stay, we discovered on the second morning that there was no hot water. We informed the receptionist, Andy, but were met with a dismissive and rude attitude. We were informed that there would be no hot water for the rest of the day, and this lack of basic amenities was for a total of three days of the six days of our stay.   Please note that according to California Civil Code §1940.2, it is the responsibility of the hotel to provide and maintain hot and cold running water for guests.  To make matters worse, when we requested to check out early due to this issue, we Cow Hollow is a very good economic hotel. Rooms were clean and the bed was comfy. The location is great. The neighborhood is very vibrant with lots of restaurants and shops nearby and walking distance to the Marina Green. The staff is friendly and willing to meet your demands. The only issue I had was one night (Saturday night) with the parking. It was a weekend and we just returned at night after sightseeing and there was no parking available. This was because many of the spots were taken by non-guests that take advantage of the free-access parking entrance. Overall great stay and would come back. We picked this hotel mainly due to the price and  parking included.  It exceeded our expectations.  The parking garage was secure and had plenty of spaces. The desk host checked us in quickly and gave us good directions on parking and reaching the room.  The room was not the most modern, but was spacious and clean. It was a nice hotel than I anticipated based on the phots.  Nice coffee / tea shop a couple blocks down which was reasonably priced as well. Everything was great except the beds were too high and no foot stool. I'm a 5ft, 5in woman, I'm taller than the average female, so I shouldn't have had an issue getting in and out of bed. Other than this, our suite was perfect! Very good economy motel , great room sevice, very clean and excellent free parking.    The diner downstairs was excellent , recommend any of the breakfast items.   Weird complaint, we needed an extra key card but for some reason  we had to wait until the next day, because they had run out.  Great hotel and friendly customer service.  Room was clean and everyone very helpful.  Free parking and proximity to restaurants at night was a huge bonus.  Felt very safe going solo at this location.  Will stay there again. A boutique, older hotel that was easy enough to find, parking was included in room rate so it was nice to stay at a hotel in safe feeling district and be able to walk to restaurants, stores, etc. Our room was plenty large, clean and had view of the Golden Gate Bridge. We took a bus tour that had a stop 2 blocks from hotel to get started, but hotel was a longer walk from wharf/end of tour than we expected. Preperation for my surgery at SF I wanted to stay a hotel that is close my hospital so I won't have to deal with traffic and parking. I found the Cow Hollow which is only 10 min away from the hospital with free self parking. Up on check in I am pleasantly suprised how nice and clean the hotel, comfortable beds, nice bathroom, secure door access, friendly staff. My room was facing the lombard which was a bit noisy but it did't bother me. If you are sensitive to the noise ask that rooms facing other side. There are plenty of restaurants and bars in walking distance which is a big plus. Good job the hotel management and staff. The location is convenient and centrally located for access to the Golden Gate Bridge, Marin Headlands, Presidio and close to most of San Francisco's more popular tourist destinations.  There is on-site parking which is a huge plus in San Francisco. The staff was very professional, efficient and friendly.  The rooms were clean, comfortable and well-appointed.   Our room was a King Suite in the rear of the building with partial city view and was very quiet.    If you are sensitive to street noise, request a room in the rear of the building.  There was not a microwave or refrigerator in the room, but there are almost limitless dining options within an easy walking distance.  Chestnut street, one block away, is a lively shopping and entertainment district.   For the room rate and                    \"},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': '                                        If you\\'re looking for the height of luxury you may want to look elsewhere, but the San Remo is a quaint little period hotel with buckets of charm.  Preserved to look like a 1920\\'s hotel, the rooms are small and cosy with only the essentials. There\\'s no TV or other entertainment but it\\'s perfect if you\\'re looking for somewhere to rest your head at night. The sink/shower facilities are seperate from the rooms so it\\'s advisable to bring a dressing gown when you travel. The showers are also modern and spacious.  Located a 10-minute walk from Fisherman\\'s Wharf, it\\'s a perfect place to stop if you\\'re visiting the city for a couple of days.   It\\'s not for everyone but I highly recommend. Great and SAFE location for anyone, especially single females.  About an 8 minute (or less) walk to Fisherman\\'s Wharf. The extra security of the locked front door gave peace of mind.  Was very excited to experience the old world charm that the San Remo had to offer and we were not disappointed!  The, ample, shared facilities added to the experience.  We never had to wait to use the restroom or showers and always very clean. The staff was always so very helpful and polite, we took advantage or the complementary coffee & hot chocolate and snacks!  We both thought the \"Quiet hours\" was a nice touch.  If you have several younger children that need assistance with restroom and shower needs, this may not be the spot for you, certainly an option with one or two. You do, however, have Stayed three nights. Perfect base to explore San Francisco in the spring. Close to fisherman’s wharf (go early to avoid the tourist crowds) and Fort Mason Park. I was lucky to find a farmers market with fresh citrus, flowers, vegetables, and locally grown nuts. Easy transportation to the rest of the city. Shared toilets and showers worked fine; I never had to wait and all guests seemed to respect the space. This quaint, old hotel was a perfect place to stay while visiting San Francisco.  It was within walking distance to Fisherman\\'s Wharf and easy to catch a bus or trolley to every place else in SF. The rooms are small but the beds are comfortable. We were reminded of similar places in Europe. Wifi is good and there are no televisions which is a nice change.  Each room has a sink and bathrooms are shared.  There was never a problem finding an available bathroom or shower to use. The hotel provides robes and ear plugs which were nice to have.  There is a quite time from 10pm to 6am I think that was respected by most of the clients.  Our room had a window (all of them don\\'t) so we did have a bit of street noise in the mornings but the ear pllugs helped. This hotel also has an Before booking this hotel, be sure to read all the reviews and look at all the photos. Fortunately, we did that, so we knew what to expect. We spent 4 nights here and loved it. Yes, the rooms are small and the bathrooms are shared. But this was never a problem. As others have pointed out, the bathrooms are super clean and we never had to actually \"share\" them. There are signs throughout about \"quiet hours\" and these were totally respected by all the guests during our 4 nights. In fact, this was one of the quietest hotels we\\'ve ever stayed in. There are no TVs here, but there is a large collection of books and magazines. The hotel is definitely quirky, both in room layout and decor, and you will remember it long after you have forgotten other hotel visits. We appreciated the We had 2 nights in this part of SF and wanted to be near Fishermans Wharf and the cable car. Both are close by as are great bike hire and restaurants and pubs. Its a bit older and rooms are small & bathrooms are communal but who cares!  It\\'s all about location and quality service here. Highly recommend If you like an old-charm hostel with a lot of character plus in a great neighborhood and good valuw for money - this is the place! My initial concern was the shared bathroom situation but it really worked out well! Let\\'s start with the good stuff - the San Remo has a great location, in a quiet neighbourhood only a short stroll from the tram station and Fishermans Wharf; it\\'s undeniably quaint; the staff are very friendly and helpful; and it\\'s pretty good value by San Francisco standards. BUT... all the rooms we saw were tiny, with little or no storage space and no bathroom. If you want to use the loo or have shower, you\\'ll be using communal facilities, along with all the other guests. By the end of a three night stay, it was feeling very cramped and inconvenient. Fine if you just need a place to freshen up and rest your head, but not somewhere you can really relax after a busy day. The San Remo Hotel is one of a kind! Located above and Italian restaurant it is a whole bunch of bedrooms with shared bathrooms. Think of a 5 star hostel really. We stayed as a family of 3 and we felt very happy in our little room. Sure the rooms are small so either have your suitcase open on the bed or you be on the bed kind of room.   Room - super clean, classic look, beds were fine, pillows - 2 each, 1 soft 1 firm. Our room = 1 double, 1 single, bedside table, desk and chair, wardrobe, heater, fan, mints and ear plugs.   Bathrooms - super clean, was fine Shari as they are designed well.   Staff - were nice and polite  Other Have a hot drink bar! This was Awesome!  2 massage chair to relax in the reading nooks I saw some people said it was noisy. We didn’t have this problem at We were thrilled to find this accommodation for such an affordable price in such a fantastic location online! Kept telling our 3 teenagers - don\\'t worry it\\'s just 3 nights we can put up with it. BUT we all loved it! So many touches to make it extra special with the drinks, lollies etc, even Combs, makeup removers, bath robes!!  Water pressure was great in the showers, never had to wait. Sharing facilities was just fine, didn\\'t bother us. Friendly staff. Good laundry for cheap price.   The rooms were small, taking out the wardrobe would be a huge help. Beds narrow & a squash but we bit our tounges with each other & coped!! Noise from down in the restaurant after closing was not good!  If you\\'re after a modern motel with lots of room then this isn\\'t for you but we would definitely San Remo is a unique gem with rich history.  We regretted not selecting a room with a sink, but enjoyed our stay.  The location is great and we enjoyed walking to Lombard St, Ghirardelli, Fisherman’s Wharf, and Pier 39.  I also highly recommend the restaurant. Step away from the big corporate giant hotel chains and experience real San Franciso hospitality in this full of character hotel with people from all over the world staying.   Bedrooms and bathroom facilities were immaculately clean. Sharing a bathroom with all the other residents was nto an issue due to how clean the team here keep it and how well organised they are. Daniel (i think that was his name) on check in was a warm welcome to the city.  Amazing location to all the local attraction. Trader Joes is 2 minutes away at the end of the street. Restaurant and bar underneath are true American Italian hospiality and fully recommend.  Stay at this hotel if you dont want to pay the eye watering prices of San Francisco chain hotels but want more comfort than a hostel. This is the Not sure, but it is possible I reviewed this fine Hotel before. I was there this May to celebrate my eldest son\\'s 35th birthday and my 35th Mother\\'s Day. It was a splendidly affordable set-up for us, since we primarily wanted to explore the great city of San Francisco and mostly on foot. AND, that is exactly what we did. We walked the city, enjoying the architecture, great food, Golden Gate Park, the gardens, until our legs were done. Then we\\'d basically start all over the next day. The great thing about San Remo is that is a small stone\\'s throw away from Fisherman\\'s Wharf, the commencement point of the Hop On - Hop Off city tours and the trips out to Alcatraz. I saw couples, families and from all over the world in this quaint, historical hotel. I would do it again... Stayed here for 2 nights. Our room was rather small, but warm and cosy. Very comfortable bed!  The rooms are all in close quarters, and the hall ways are very noisy. We were woken up constantly during the night.   The staff were very nice and helpful with our questions.  We were a little apprehensive regarding the shared bathroom however we agreed to go ahead and book regardless. Wow! What a place. Perfect location and the hotel was just as we would\\'ve liked. Quaint and querky and perfect for what we wanted as a base. Spotlessly clean and just perfect. A nice little touch with the free tea/coffee making facilities, abundance of biscuits, chocolates and sweets to help ourselves. We would 100% return to this hotel on our return visit to San fransisco next year. Cannot recommend this hotel enough! OK so when we googled this place the words \"shared bathroom\" did not appeal.  We read the reviews and no one had a bad word to say about the San Remo Hotel.  As we were only there for 2 nights we thought we would give it a go.  WOW all we can say is we LOVED IT.  It felt like a home away from home.  The \"Shared Bathrooms\" were spotlessly clean, towels etc all clean and provided outside the bathrooms. The bedrooms were small, but hey we were only sleeping there! They were clean and in keeping of the era of the hotel.  Loved the never ending and free tea, coffee, hot chocolate, sweeties in the hall - met people there very early in the morning all of us in our night shirts, making out coffee - it was just like being home.  Totally recommend this place, we would stay again without It depends very much what do you expect and what are you into. If you cannot handle anything else than just perfect modern rooms, you might not feel yourself here. Me and my fiance loved this hotel so much for its special vibe. Must admit that the first moment when we got to the small, old-fashioned room, i did not feel most comfortable. In the end i really fell in love with this place and would recommend it.  The vibe of the hotel is very special, more of the old days style. The bathrooms and showers are shared but they smell so wonderful and were always very clean!  Location is the best, you are close to Pier 39 and Fishermans wharf, our favourite area!  Plus the price is unbeatable!  This hotel made our SF stay so romantic! Set above the oldest Italian restaurant in America, it’s a prime location for a stay in San Francisco! The food downstairs was delicious. The hotel itself was very quirky and like you’re staying in somebody’s house. They have a lot of nice artworks and it’s warm and inviting. The shared bathrooms were clean always and in great working order. The room was very small with not a lot of space for anything other then luggage but overall a pretty good stay. Great spot in walking distance to everything.  As a family of 6, we loved this hotel. I have never stayed in anything like it. San Remo feels like a museum once you walk in, with the walls covered in history.  Our children loved they offered little treats and beverages, it was such a nice touch. This hotel was always immacuately clean and although the bathrooms are shared we never had an issue with waiting or cleanliness.  With only a short walk to the warf and a grocery store a block away this hotel suited us perfectly.  I just want to add that the staff are lovely and the beds were super comfy! If we were to return to San Francisco this would be our go-to! We booked through booking.com and stayed during November 2019.  The location was brilliant, close to Fisherman’s Wharf and Chinatown, but far enough away to not hear noise from those areas.  The hotel was clean, homely and welcoming. Our room was quite small, but that wasn’t a bad thing, just a heads up if you have a lot of luggage. I also loved the style of the hotel. Fresh brew coffee for free and the massage chairs were a nice touch. Staff were always around making sure areas were clean and presentable. Highly recommend and I’d stay here again. '},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': '                    Excellent Location Staff was amazing Above & Beyond my expectations  Front Desk staff were friendly and helpful  Housekeeping Services was also so amazing  Housekeeping services at other Hotel brands need a lessons from Hyatt Fantastic location.  could walk everywhere we needed to go and easy in and out for Uber when we couldn’t walk.  Friendly front desk staff.  Small lobby.  Great breakfast buffet.  Room comfortable but bed is a little hard for my taste.  Only offered soft down-like pillows.   Main complaint though is a super tiny closet.  We had clothes on hangers as wedding guest.  Plenty of drawer space.   Room was quiet, and everything worked well. The location is perfect for a tourist like me. We used the bikes two days, which was a nice touch. There\\'s a few good non-touristy restaurants nearby (Google Maps has everything you need). The hidden fees are insane however. There\\'s the $30 activity fee, but there\\'s also fees that are assessed by other entities. There\\'s an occupancy tax, SF TID, CA Tourism fee, Moscone District fee, destination fee, Dest. Fee Occupancy Tax, Dest. Fee SF TID, Dest. Fee CA Tourism Assessment and Dest. Fee Moscone District. When you add it up, your room rate will be about 70% of the your bill.  We had a wonderful stay at Hyatt Centric. It is walking distance to the Wharf, Lombard Street, and many other locations. It has very safe underground valet parking. Bikes are provided as part of the stay. Beds and pillows were very comfortable and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  We stayed with 3 young kids and had a blast.  This hotel is convenient to everything within a short walk.  Good breakfast at the hotel and excellent one across the street.  Hot tub and heater pool were excellent after a long day of walking. Destination & parking fees not included in the price of the room, which was fairly odd. There should be no additional payments when you get to the hotel besides the deposit but that was not the case here  We loved how close the hotel was to everything we wanted to see and do. The hotel was super clean. The staff was also very helpful when we needed to leave our luggage and car at the hotel after we checked out.  I will say the housekeeping is among the best I’ve ever had. The room was spotless and kept dust free over the entire two weeks we were there.  Safety wise, it wasn’t too bad compared to how downtown is in San Francisco right now. It was a little bit uncomfortable, walking to the main part of fisherman‘s wharf after dark.  The overall decor and aesthetics were pretty dreadful. So if you’re looking for luxury you’ll need to pay double or triple.  We felt we got what we paid for and with the exception of the breakfast it was a good value.  We were very grateful to have hot tub (super rare in SF). The beds were more comfortable than other hotels in this price bracket.    We were a group of 35 people for a business event and we did not receive consistent room quality. My room was mint and newly refurbished but most from our team had old rooms, pretty run down and smelling old.  There were no power sockets near the bedtable nor the sofa / desk area. The only easy way was to charge my phone and laptop in the bathroom! Similarly in order to use the coffee brewer machine I had to look for a socket down behind the tv. Not comfortable at all.  Similarly internet both in rooms and in the meeting room was not consistent, working well at times then suddenly disconnecting for about a minute.  During our business event one person entered our conference room, seemed to check on the drink supplies then left. He was not dressed in the hotel suit and we later Great location close to Powell Street Cable Car end point, Fisherman\\'s Wharf, and other San Francisco tourist attractions. Included breakfast buffet made it convenient to eat and then start the day\\'s activities.  Quick vacation,  excellent location.   Staff was friendly room service daily.  Overall,  we\\'d stay again.  Bikes scooters onsite.  Everything worked properly in room.  Close to restaurants, shops.  Rooms were quiet. As a family of 3, we booked this hotel as a base of location for our bream in San Francisco.   We\\'ve found the hotel to be clean and tidy in every area (including fitness centre,  around the pool and spa pool). All the stuff was so friendly and  couldn\\'t do enough for you. Extra towels and robes for the pool and pool spa were all provided in a quick and efficient way.   Check-in and check out were quick and easy.  Great location, as not too close to the wharf or Pier 39, but close enough for a quick walk.   Highly recommended for a stay.  Nice hotel.  Rooms were clean and the salad I had in the Brick & Beam was fabulous!  Meeting space was tired and not as nice as I expected.  Staff was very accommodating.  Location to the waterfront couldn\\'t be better, however, was a little nervous outside due to the amount of homeless folks sleeping on the sidewalks. Worst accommodation of my life!!! I arrived and the room was stinking, the sheets smelled of urine, I asked to change them, and after waiting 2 hours they said they had changed them but they didn\\'t! When they actually went to make the change, I was there and saw that everything was full of pee, sheets, bed, pillows, everything stained with pee, disgusting!!! The manager just wanted to cancel my reservation and didn\\'t even apologize! The bathroom was also leaking, the breakfast was charged incorrectly... in short, everything was terrible! I hated this place! I do not recommend it at all!!!! We stayed here with our well behaved dog (Heidi) and couldn\\'t have been happier.  All of the staff were very welcoming and very helpful.  Dining with our dog was very easy as we were permitted to eat in their very open passageway area next to the main dining room.  Location is great!  Hotel is situated within a block of the F Street Trolley and three blocks from Fisherman\\'s Wharf.   We usually stay at the the San Francisco Hyatt Regency on the Embarcadero when we travel to San Francisco without our dog, but were very happy at the Hyatt Centric Fisherman\\'s Wharf.  Again, can\\'t say enough about how nice and helpful the staff were!  Will definitely be back!  And all the stuff you hear about San Francisco being overrun with crime and homeless, didn\\'t see that during our four day First, this hotel is perfectly located.  It\\'s nice and the rooms are a good size.  However, they do not include a top sheet with your bedding.  Just the fitted sheet and the down comforter -- which we all know does not get washed often.  Thinking this was just a simple mistake, we notified the front desk of this and they told us that is the hotel policy.  We travel a lot and have NEVER not had a top sheet.  Thinking the person at the front desk was just lazy and didn\\'t want to resolve the issue, we asked another person at the front desk the following day and she also confirmed that it is their policy NOT to include a top sheet. Thankfully they gave us a sheet and we made the bed, but I can\\'t believe they expect us to just use the heavy down comforter that other people have sweat This was one of the worst Hyatt experiences i have ever had. The staff at the restaurant was outright rude and the service was non existent. That is if you can call it service. Breakfast (buffet) was about $40 which is so overpriced when you consider other places and options nearby.  Staff at the front desk was cold and you better check the prices if you buy something from the marketplace - which was just a fancy term for snack bar. Avoid this location if you can. Unable to contact front desk after phone rang for ten minuted/ They are extremely short staffed. There is no shuttle service and good luck with a taxi. The staff are obviously overworked. there is no service beyond checin. after that you are on your own. Good location, but I was surprised to find unexpected \"Resort Fees\" on my bill when I checked out. I volunteered to not have my room cleaned during my 3-day stay and they never replaced my linens or the one complimentary water bottle (they charge $5 for any additional bottles of water that you request). Despite this, they insisted on adding the daily $35 fee -- which was not advertised and they are not transparent about what it is for, and then refused to discuss it. Increasingly, consumer protection agencies are flagging these Resort Fees for investigation (and in some places, they\\'re illegal) -- there was an article about these fees yesterday in The New York Times. Overall, the hotel was pretty standard/unexceptional and the surprise fees felt dishonest, so it left a bad taste This hotel was really nice! The staff were very friendly, accommodating and helpful. The rooms were very clean and the staff did a great job making sure we had enough towels and essentials for our room. It was the very first hotel I stayed in San Francisco and I will not be my last. It was centrally located near Fisherman\\'s Wharf, the cable cars, and sight-seeing tours. I had a wonderful time! Housekeeping attempted to come into my room twice before the checkout time even though I hadn\\'t physically checked out with the front desk. It would be nice for them to respect those times as the room is paid for up until 11am.  This hotel is in the perfect area. The staff is so nice,  the hotel is very clean and also quiet when naps were needed. I loved it here. The restaurant in the hotel was very good too. Highly recommended  Great place.  Very helpful staff and service. Love the spa, pool, exercise room and restaurant. Clean comfy beds. Great housekeeping service. Also met friends here and like the living room set up in reception area. I stayed there, and some friends stayed there as well for a special occasion. The lobby was clean, the front desk was friendly and efficient.  The elevator set up was a little strange but it worked.  The room was clean, bed was comfortable, and bathroom was adequate.  There were robes and slippers in the closet.  There was some noise outside at night, but not enough to keep me up.  The breakfast was excellent, and service was good.  The pantry was absurdly priced!  The location was perfect. Upon looking for a hotel to stay while on vacation in San Francisco, we were a little skeptical about the location.  Upon arriving, we noticed that it was very clean around the hotel and very centrally location to Pier 39 and the Wharf.   You could walk to everything or to the public transportation to take you anywhere in the city.  The staff at the hotel were very welcoming and helpful to all situations.  we will stay here again when we return to San Francisco. Rooms and bathrooms were clean and very easy to use. The house cleaning staff and reception staff were friendly and helpful. Peace of mind in an unfamiliar place is very important.  Also, the breakfast was very good and the smoked salmon was very satisfying. Extremely rude and unhelpful check-in manager. They seemed to go out of their way to be difficult and obnoxious, incapable of a welcoming greeting or smile and requiring confirmation and then re-confirmation of our booking several hours later. Nice hotel, great valet parking (which is a must in SF these days), and so close to walking to the Piers that we did it a few times. Walked to the Pier for the Alcatraz tour too.  Busy area but was nice staying in a hotel nearby. Elevators are a little wacky with their setup, but you just have to deal with that. We had a late night check in and were greeted with a man smoking drugs at the entrance to the hotel. I accept the hotel have little control over this but nevertheless didn\\'t make the start great! The hotel is tidy, it does the trick if you want to stay near to Fishermans Wharf, Pier 39 etc. The room was tidy but a little outdated and the whole hotel looks in need of a refresh. Breakfast was very average. The quality of the food on offer is acceptable but nothing special.   Didn\\'t use the parking facilities. Its a 10 minute walk to Fishermans Wharf and access to the Golden Gate Bridge is easy from nearby bus stop.   Probably wouldn\\'t stop at this hotel again but that\\'s more to do with the amount of homeless in the area rather than the hotel itself.   Excellent location. Nice hotel. Very quiet.   We came as a couples trip and wanted to be close to the action without all the noice. This hit the spot as a solid Hyatt hotel. Like a halfway between a Hyatt Place and full-fledged Hyatt.   Lots of easy access to Fisherman’s Wharf and Ubers to anywhere.'},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': \"                    If you're looking for a prime location in the city, this hotel has got you covered. It's situated in the heart of Union Square, which means you're just steps away from some of the best shopping, dining, and entertainment options in the city. Plus, the cable car stops right outside the hotel, so you can easily explore other parts of San Francisco. The hotel itself has a quaint, old-school charm that adds to the overall experience. And while the bathrooms may be a bit small, they're perfectly functional. If you're looking for a luxurious stay, this might not be the hotel for you. The amenities are pretty basic, and there's no fitness center or pool. And while the hotel does offer a complimentary breakfast, it's nothing to write home about. But let's be real, who needs a fancy gym Booked this hotel prior to our cruise, Great location one block from China town gate, with small rooms but is clean and comfortable, not too many facilities, We arrived at 11.30 AM and they let us have an early check-in. Close to all public transportation and many restaurants. Taking Uber to the Cruise ship pier only cost $12.00. Perfect for our one-night stay. Recommended I have stayed at 5 star hotels and motels before. But after this I would’ve rather stayed in a motel. Don’t get me wrong, the staff was as accommodating as they could’ve been, but it was the hotel itself that just honestly ruined the trip for me. The walls are so thin that I woke up 2 separate times in the middle of the night to another couple doing the deed (so loud and amplified you could hear it on every room in the floor) and a man snoring at 4 am. The bed was as hard as a rock we had to ask for a mattress cover. And, the heater was on full blast and it’s automatic so it was so unbearably hot. Additionally, the rooms look nothing like pictured. They are so incredibly small and not as modern as pictured. I’m writing this as I am listening to the man snoring from what sounds Stayed in a supposed higher class hotel before but the neighborhood was questionable. Was pleasantly surprised by how clean and safe Chinatown was at night. The hotel in this area exceeded expectations with its convenient location, friendly staff, and comfortable rooms. I would highly recommend for those looking for a safe, affordable, and comfortable stay in the heart of the city. Had a fantastic stay at this hotel. Room was comfortable and clean, staff was friendly and accommodating. Overall, a great experience and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay. Stayed at this hotel and was pleasantly surprised by the abundance of delicious restaurants in the area. Room was clean and comfortable, staff was friendly. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a convenient and budget-friendly stay while indulging in the local cuisine. The rooms at this hotel are small, but for the low rate, I can't complain much. Despite the size, the room was clean and well-maintained, and the bed was comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the location of the hotel was convenient for my needs. Overall, if you're looking for a budget-friendly option and don't mind small rooms, this hotel is a great choice. I recently stayed at a small and cute boutique hotel and I have to say, it was one of the best hotel experiences I've had in a while. From the moment I walked in, I was struck by the charming decor and cozy atmosphere. The hotel staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, and they went out of their way to ensure that my stay was comfortable and enjoyable. Overall, I would highly recommend this small and cute boutique hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The staff, room and location are all top-notch, and I can't wait to come back and stay here again. The hotel offers comfortable accommodations and friendly service, but the room I stayed in could benefit from an update to the carpeting. The carpet was old, which detracted from the overall look and feel of the room. However, this was the only downside to an otherwise great stay. The staff was welcoming and helpful, and the hotel was clean and well-maintained. The location was also convenient, with easy access to local attractions and amenities. Overall, the hotel is a good option for those looking for comfortable and convenient accommodations, but be aware that some of the rooms may have older carpeting. Great room, comfortable beds, beautiful hotel over all. I did not hear any outside noise while in my room. Very happy with staying here. Will stay at this hotel again. Very relaxing atmosphere with newer technology. Great as a crash pad. This hotel in China Town is a great choice for those looking for a convenient location close to the Union Square. The rooms are clean and comfortable, and the staff is friendly and helpful. The location is perfect for exploring the city and all it has to offer. Highly recommend!  The hotel in China Town is a great option for those looking for a convenient location near the Financial District. The rooms are spacious and well-appointed, and the staff is friendly and helpful. The hotel's location in the heart of China Town is perfect for exploring the neighborhood's vibrant restaurants and shops. Overall, a great choice for a comfortable and affordable stay in San Francisco. I canceled my lease in San Francisco during the pandemic. However, since it is now 2023 and my boss requires that I come into the office once in awhile. The rate for this place is great and it is close to Financial District I am glad they have an elevator for my suitcases. The hotel is conveniently located close to the Financial District and Union Square, making it easy to explore the city. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel also had a great breakfast buffet that was included in the room rate. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Francisco. I had come to San Francisco to watch a game at Chase Center, this place was pretty close to it. The service was decent, not that I used a lot of it, but the location was perfect, right in the heart of San Francisco with plenty of happenings near by. I've recently stayed at this hotel in China Town in San Francisco and it was a great experience. The location is perfect, right next to the Financial District making it easy to get to all the major attractions and events in the city. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, and the room was clean and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Francisco. Close to the Oracle Park, small room, but just used as launch pad to visit San Francisco. I felt safe and comfortable for the duration of my stay, and thought the hotel offered great value for the area.  It is a much better value than the Hilton. At least the neighborhood where this hotel is located is cleaner. Good location with lots to do. Wonderful staff! Very happy with my stay and will stay here again. Highly recommend.  The water pressure in the bathroom was good, I had a great shower. The bed was a bit hard, but once my body adjusted, it was ok.  The rate here is much cheaper than anywhere else with similar amenities. This is cheaper than some Airbnbs I have stayed in, and it is much more casual. The furniture is new and looks beautiful. With peaceful atmosphere make me feel better than others location. I highly recommend There are a lot of great restaurants around here. I highly recommend this place. Save some money from the stay to use for good food. Staying here was definitely the best idea I’ve had. It was worth it.  I stayed in a supposedly higher class hotel than this, but the neighborhood was kind of rough. Surprisingly, Chinatown is still quite clean and safe at night. The staff was professional during my stay and I would highly recommend. I am an avid reviewer I always check reviews before going but to my surprise this one caught me off guard. For starters the room was soooo much smaller than advertised, the smell and mugginess in the room was awful, sound proofing non existent and if you have any luck you’ll leave without bed bugs or whatever flesh eating bacteria I got from staying here for 3 nights. I have attempted to have this taken care of with no luck they refuse to refund me and I’m now seeking medical attention from staying here. The price does not meet the quality I expected. All I have to say is don’t! Keep looking you’ll be better off in the end. Stayed at the Grant Plaza Hotel in September on arrival the bed was stiff and not acceptable to sleep on. The maintenance person brought a piece of dirty foam to put on top of the mattress. He did not know how to make up the bed. There was no house keeping working when i drew back the sheets they were dirty. The maintenance man brought another doona which was just as bad. Outside the window used cigarette buts, room old and tired and grubby. Front desk staff member Nash the rudest person i have encountered Manager Ken cannot get my deposit refunded after 2 weeks after many emails, refuses to respond to calls\\xa0  The worst hotel experience ever encountered\\xa0   Stayed here for 2 nights and was pleasantly surprised. Prices are quite affordable considering it's in San Francisco. The location was great. I booked this hotel in particular primarily because of its rather close proximity to the BART station. It is indeed only a 10-minute walk from Montgomery station, although if you're arriving from the airport be prepared to drag your bags uphill.  The hotel is smack dab in the middle of Chinatown in a rather busy area. I never felt unsafe here, whether evening or early morning, as there are always people milling about minding their own business. If you like walking, you can journey to Fisherman's Wharf within 30 minutes on foot, which is what I did. You can also walk in the opposite direction toward Westfield and Target if you like to shop. Having booked the trip of a lifetime to the states my first stop was San Francisco. Unfortunately my holiday company had located me in a hotel over 30 miles from the city so I decided to book an emergency air b&b. The Grant Plaza Hotel literally saved my holiday. I hadn’t expected much as it was cheap but on arrival I was pleasantly surprised. This fantastic little hotel is in a great location, the staff were super friendly and the room blew me away to be honest!. I wish I’d booked this place from the start & I’d recommend it to anyone wanting to visit this city. Overall a lovely stay and I couldn’t find anything to complain about. Great location with many eateries nearby, safe area within 10mins walk to subway, just that hotel is located on a slope so it's a good workout with your luggage ;p Got a room that has nice big windows, but heater wasn't working well n walls are thin so it wasn't that warm at night in winter. Small shower/bathroom but it works well. My wife and I stayed here in Jan 2022. It was on the cheaper side so I wasn't expecting much, but we were pleasantly surprised. The room itself was pretty standard, but the bathroom and shower were excellent.  There is a parking garage about 5 min walking distance away that you can reserve through the front desk at a reduced rate. the room has been reserved, but they still did an extra charge of 18 dollars will be charged for placing luggage in advance, the two beds on the order will be changed to one, and the extra bed service will be charged separately.不太满意另外加钱，网络营销误导性，对于行李提前存放另外收取18 美元的 费用是不合理的，对于床的问题在网络上是两张单人床，但是说只有一张床，这是欺骗和误导\"},\n",

Stuart was an excellent bartender with a great attitude and service.  The location of the hotel is great just blocks away from great shopping.  Our junior suite room was spacious making it a great experience and would stay again. Stayed at Parc 55 for one night while on a mini vacation in CA.  We arrived late (due to Amtrak) but had no issues checking in.  We'd been upgraded to a Junior Suite on the 13th Floor.  The hotel felt secure.  There was a security checkpoint in the ground floor lobby with the check-in desks on the 2nd floor.  The lobby is bright and open and very modern looking.  The room was nice - very spacious and open with a separate seating area.  However, it's a little dated and really needs to be brought into the 21st century.  That said, we slept well with no noise or other disruptions from the street or anywhere else.  Proper glassware is provided in the room which is good to see.  Nothing worse than drinking wine out of a plastic tumbler.  There's also a little PDA with details about My friend and I planned to stay a couple of nights at the Parc 55 and decided to pay extra for a deluxe view room as a treat. We were somewhat disappointed. The room was okay and did have a view but otherwise I wouldn’t call it deluxe.  Do all US hotels only provide paper cups for coffee in the room? I have travelled to many countries and that was a first for me.  Especially as there was a total of two paper cups provided for two people per day - they needed to be reused if you wanted more than one cup. Reuse is better for the environment but we could have washed and reused a real mug.  However my main complaint is that the free wifi was very poor.  It was too slow to send emails or upload social media posts with photos. WhatsApp was  blocked by the system which was We just stayed there for 5 nights to celebrate a special event and would give it a 5 star!  We arrived at noon and Mavis from Front Desk checked us in swiftly and let us checked in early, upgraded our room and gave us bottles of water.  She was so warm and welcoming which was especially appreciated a long flight.  She was very polite and was very professional in her job.    After I got into my room, I already received a text message from her if I need anything else.  I was able to ask for sofa bed set up and last minute housekeeping by simply texting her.  In the middle of my stay, I got another message asking how stay was and if she could anything else.  Housekeeping always come on a daily basis unless if I put on the DND sign (contrary to some earlier reviews perhaps due to We had the pleasure of staying at the Parc55 for the first time over the weekend. The hotel is in an ideal location, close to shopping, entertainment and dining. We received the warmest welcome upon our arrival by the fabulous front desk agent Christina Campbell. She went above and beyond to ensure our stay was perfect. She took the time to answer all our questions and ensure our happiness. She is a valuable employee, who is exceptional at her job. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay, from arrival and check-in to late check out and departure, everything was really great.   Loved: modern and fast elevators, beautiful decor, stunning view from my room, comfortable bed, great shower head (that’s a big deal for me), clean and well-maintained room and property overall, the most pleasant customer service, downtown location, close to ALLLLL the shopping and I do mean all the shopping. Everything, including cable cars and transit, is within walking distance. Great restaurants nearby and again, great shopping. Also, as a guest, you have access to the Hilton across the street, which has a pool (weather too cold for me but if that’s your thing, have at it) and best of all, Cityscape, which is a super sexy bar/lounge with a 360° view of the The cruise line suggested this hotel.  It was very nice - expensive.  Luxurious - expensive. Area not the best for walking and 1 fast food place close enough.  The food in the hotel was yes, expensive. I spend 90+ nights per year in just Hilton brands alone. I'm middle aged and not high maintenance. Additionally due to my industry/company, I was required to travel during the entire COVID nightmare. I totally understand the challenges and changes the pandemic brought to hotels and have a great deal of respect for the hospitality industry as a whole.  On 04/21 I was emailed by Hilton Honors in regards to my stay thinking someone had already contacted me. Below was my response which I have yet to received any follow up from.  Good day, Thank you for your follow up. However no one has been in contact with me? As far as my recent experience at Hilton Parc 55, it was very disappointing.  Arrival: We're two adults with 4 bags. None of the three valets/bellmen (who were doing nothing) We felt welcomed and valued from the moment we walked in until the time we left and started missing this property and the great staff. Perfectly located close to the Cable Car turnaround, theaters, restaurants, and shopping in Union Square. Our room was spacious, comfortable, and quiet, with a spectacular view. The fitness facility is extremely well-equipped, the on-site restaurants are top-notch, plus the staff is attentive, friendly, and thoughtfully friendly.  We will definitely choose to stay here again! We decided to stay at the Parc 55 hotel in San Francisco to celebrate our 38th wedding anniversary, and the hotel and staff did not disappoint.  The room was spectacular, the bed and pillows were comfortable, and the staff were warm and helpful.  The hotel is centrally located, easily accessible, and close to the Westfield Mall.  Special thanks to Christina Campbell who greeted us at the check in counter and helped make our wedding anniversary visit truly special and memorable.   We are looking forward to our next trip and will be sure to stay at a Hilton hotel, where the spirit and hospitality of the founder, Conrad Hilton, is alive, well, and on display through their staff.  Thank you so very much! \"},\n",

Oh & VERY much took advantage of the fact No hotel to make business with. I book regularly a room for a collaborator, the location is ideal. Due to a shifted meeting, I had to cancel a stay, which I did per mail 4 days before. I never got a confirmation and when I called, they claimed they would not read their mails and will not refund any money. I wrote to the manager but never got an answer. They don\\'t care about their customers. The Stanyan is a very convenient hotel by UCSF. Its also by Haight Ashbury district. They have a wonderful free continental breakfast and happy hour which was really nice and great selection.  The hotel is an old SF hotel and a bit noisy but worth it for the reasons above.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. I suggest you book as soon as you know your dates because they book up fast. We were not told until the night before that at 3:00AM a fleet of cement trucks would take up position right under our window. The noise was unbelievable and went on until 7:30pm. The room was not habitable this entire time. Management obviously knew this would happen but intentionally failed to mention it until it was too late for us the cancel. We should be refunded for the night. The hotel is fine but we very much feel deceived and would never do business with this place again I have never written a review but the stay and treatment at this hotel was unbelievable. This is the dirtiest hotel I have ever stayed in. On Wednesday, August 16, my husband and I arrived after a long international flight. We had a 2 night reservation. We were stunned when er walked into the room. The carpet was beyond stained and filthy. We went downstairs to speak to the clerk at the desk. He stated they were sold out for the evening but tomorrow morning we could checkout and recheck into a new room. Because we had been traveling for 24 hours and the bathroom was actually clean, we made the mistake of staying put. Needless to say, we did not sleep well that evening.  When I looked at the room in the daylight the next morning, I also noticed a bloody blob on the dust ruffle. I have had the pleasure of staying at the Stanyan Park Hotel prior an incident that occurred on Janaury 4, 2023. I just had surgery and needed to lay down to avoid any complications from my surgery. I was told I could not check in before 3PM even if the rooms were clean and available. I had previous checked in at 5AM (based on availability, of course). The idea that I was standing there bleeding from my eye at 10AM and was told regardless of a clean room becoming available, that I could not check in was not nice.  I had to cancel and go elsewhere and the hotel decided not to refund any part of my money-a repeat customer; putting profits before the wellness of their customers. Clean, boutique hotel close by UCSF Medical Center and across from Golden Gate Park. Although rooms are smallish, they are comfortable. Beds/pillows very comfy. Breakfast (included) is excellent. Large quality choices  I would stay again My family checked in new years eve. When we returned to our room after the new years fireworks at the bay we found rats had eaten the complementry chocolates left by housekeeping and laid droppings in our beds. We had to find new accomodations at 2am on new years day. The hotel staff didnt even offer to help find a new hotel, and there reaction told us they knew about the rats. It took 30 minutes to even get my card refunded for the stay. Alll in all a horrible experience. I wish i could leave 0 stars. Best thing was the location .. across from Golden Gate Park , one block from Haight St and easy to catch buses nearby. Our room was tiny (113 ) about the size of our bathroom and we were told it was not possible to upgrade. It was clean which was a plus . The complimentary breakfast we found was American orientated… unhealthy and sugar loaded but would appeal  to children . Staff were perfunctory . In New Zealand reception staff go out if their way to make guests feel welcome and be helpful … maybe this is just an American thing but it felt pretty much like they were just there for their wages. So the building looks fabulous from the outside but could do with a real freshen up inside. Would have been satisfactorily  for one night but would have enjoyed it more if we could have    My stay at the Stanyon Park Hotel was necessary as a family member was an inpatient at at UCSF which is within walking distance. I met my House keeper on my day early check out by random occurrences in the hallway. She was incredibly polite and thoughtful; in asking me specific questions about care needs for my room. I explained I was checking out early so her thoughts were appreciated but not necessary.  The rest of the staff seemed to only be there for the purpose of working; not for the needs of customers.     All or most of the rooms at the Stanyon Park Hotel face inward upon each other at some point; like a horse shoe. This causes many issues. From sounds that carry ( voices, music, children screaming, personal sounds, phone calls etc.) , the inability to open the window We stayed in a 2 bedroom unit, complete with a full kitchen, separate dinning room and living room.  We were very comfortable and really used the kitchen.  This was like a small apartment.  The kitchen was fully stocked,  with a ful sized refrigerator.  The location was great, with a Whole Food just 1 block away.  Golden Gate Park was literally right across the street.  The hotel staff was extremely accomodating to any requests and all very polite. We stayed in room 111, which was the cupola room on the corner. we had a king bed and a comfortable rollaway for three of us. The hotel is a national register building, very cute Victorian with lots of great historical photos on the walls. The staff was very nice, and they had free breakfast (not the greatest, but adequate to get you up and out the door) and wine and cheese in the evening. There is no parking at the hotel, you have to go across the street to a public parking lot which is $25 a day. The location a block from the Haight and right at the edge of Golden Gate Park was fantastic. The biggest downside was that the bed was uncomfortable, and there was sever street noise- did not get any sleep. I do not recommend. This hotel added $150 fraudulent charge after I checked out (cat pee supposedly... even though I don\\'t have a cat). After questioning and refuting the charge, the manager will now not even take my calls. Other: thin walls and rooms smell pretty bad. Bad experience overall. Great hotel. Very quaint and historic. Perfect if you like older style. Great rooms. Nice lobby. Breakfast was ok. Our room was getting new carpet after we left. Right across the street from the park. Very nice! Close to Whole Foods. I like the neighborhood that this hotel is in so I\\'ve stayed there a few times, but I won\\'t stay there again. The hotel was last renovated in the early 80s, and it shows. The carpets are badly stained, the wallpaper is pealing off, and the rooms smell strongly of mildew. I hadn\\'t been there in 4 years and was surprised by how filthy it had become. It\\'s in desperate need of renovation. For $185/night, there are dozens of better options. The staff is amazing and way more patient than they have to be . Matthew was able to accommodate an early check in for us without any advance notice, and he did so while also being harassed by an elderly male Karen who demanded, at various points, to speak to the owner of the hotel, for Matthew to \"wake up\" the GM (at 2pm on a Saturday), and for the internet to \"stop lying\" because he failed to realize that the room type he booked was street facing. Pro tip: all the rooms with double beds are street facing, if that is a deal breaker, but the neighborhood is so quiet I can\\'t imagine it would be too big of a deal.   I can\\'t believe people can still be so rude in the middle of a pandemic and with the hospitality industry as burdened as it is, but Matthew handled it with grace. Sean This is a great little boutique hotel. Reminds me of an English guest house with lots of character. It is way out of the hustle and bustle of the city center but easy enough to get to. I love the location as it is right across from Golden Gate Park. So nice to take beautiful long walks in the morning, quiet and peaceful. Safe neighborhood to walk around. Good breakfast, snacks throughout the day and wine in the evening. Whole Foods one block away, pub next door and several restaurants within a few blocks. If you are in SF for UCSF Medical center this is the place to stay.  But main shout out is to the staff. I have stayed here several nights while my husband was in the hospital and each time Matthew has been amazing. One call and he efficiently and politely handles every Moved our child into school - and this is the closest hotel.  AMAZING STAFF!  Very helpful - always ready with an answer to all my questions.  We decided at the last minute we wanted to stay an extra night.  The staff went above and beyond to get us a room for the night and moved our luggage for us while we were out.  Will stay there again. We stayed 2 weekend nites while visiting friends who lived a few miles farther out.  The Good:  large room, very comfortable king bed and nice bathroom, friendly & helpful staff.  The cautions:  our 2nd floor room faced Stanyan St and the street noise at night from bar next door may well bother many people.  Hotel Wi-Fi is Slow, not up to standard.  Location was good for us in area w/o numerous choices. The location of the hotel is amazing. The price is extremely competitive. Free WiFi and breakfast. Staff are very helpful and friendly. The room and hotel itself is very clean. The only drawback is that there is no heating or AC. It can get cold if you\\'re not used to the climate there (but I\\'m from TX). But I would definitely stay there again. I chose Stanyan Park for its location since it was the closest to my son’s apartment in Corona Heights.  My husband and I stayed in a suite, that was complete with full kitchen, dining room, living room, very clean bathroom and 2 large bedrooms.  The king bed was very comfortable and the bed linens were high quality.  We were able to come and go from our suite by back stairs that were very convenient.  Staff were available but we didn’t have any problems so interaction wasn’t necessary.  Our room was cleaned daily and we were able to get prepackaged breakfast items and coffee, juices and water.  The afternoon tea and managers reception have been suspended due to Covid.  The hotel has character and we enjoyed our stay. Beautiful, clean, and in a great area. Staff was attentive and helpful. They took care of some problem guests on our last night who were making a lot of noise, and made sure we were safe and comfortable. Watch out for parking tickets!!! Driving through San Francisco in my way home I decided to stay at Stanyan Park for the night. I found the hotel clean, the room was basic in terms of amenities but nice enough, and the location was perfect.   The front desk staff were all amazing at all points of contact; during and after my stay.   I left my toiletry bag in the bathroom and didn’t discover this until I arrived home in San Diego. I panicked, my toiletry bag had several medications that were not only VERY expensive, but mediation that MUST be taken daily. I immediately called the hotel and they informed me that it was located and that once I arranged for shipping they would send it out right away. Of course I arranged with Fedex for shipping, confirmed with the desk agent that she had received the shipping label Our brother was care flighted for heart surgery.  We were not sure of which date the surgery would be done because of all the testing required.  Mathew worked with us on all levels to ensure that we would be able to either stay or go back to Nevada and then come back for the actual surgery since the date was up in the air.  I appreciate the thoughfulness displayed by him.  He deserves a raise as he goes beyond the call of duty.  I have never dealt with anyone of this caliber before. Great stay and Matthew at reception was a savior in going above and beyond to help get a ring that went down the sink. Hands-down great service overall, right next to Golden Gate Park which is a wonderful stroll to the beach! This hotel is ADORABLE! We stayed in a Queen and twin bed suite and it wasn’t a hotel room - it was an apartment! So huge!! The staff was really nice. The breakfast was the standard hotel free breakfast deal. The location was really great. The only down fall was that you can hear everything happening in the room above you and on the street. The place has some wear and tear, it’s not perfect - but we loved it.  The staff are friendly and very helpful. The room was adequate and the mattress comfortable. Wish the water for bathing was hotter. The deodorant for cleaning has a strong over-powering smell. The continental breakfasts are tasty.  Quality and taste of their coffee could use improvement. In general this a nice place to stay. The hotel was unique.  Rooms are outdated, but clean.  Breakfast was great and Staff was very helpful.  There are a lot of places within walking distance.  There is some street noise from cars, but it was not too bad. We stayed at this place as friends recommended the Haight/Ashbury area of SF. This was the only hotel we could find about 4 weeks out from our stay.  Some reviews are critical of the place but after 4 weeks of touring Washington, New York and New Orleans this was one of the best places we have stayed.  A very generous room size with a big half circle window overlooking the Golden Gate Park, two heaters that made it nice a toasty after a couple of cold days and a very generous breakfast, afternoon tea and wine cheese and savoury biscuits in the afternoon.  Very well redecorated to match the older period of the hotel.  We loved it.  All very close to all public transport options, including big bus tour stop around the corner, and any imaginable restaurant in Haight Street, even On a recent (all too short) visit to San Francisco, we stayed at the fabulous Stanyan Park Hotel. What a gem! The hotel is utterly delightful. We were in one of the two corner cupola rooms and had plenty of space. The staff are friendly and helpful (even to supercilious guests - I saw one or two that made me cringe), the afternoon tea and early evening wine & cheese are a charming bonus, and the location is outstanding. The hotel is just a short walk to a bus stop - hop on the No 7 to get downtown via Haight and Market Street. It\\'s also very close to an excellent organic grocery store (not normally my kind of thing, but when in Rome …) and for music nuts, a ginormous CD and record store (conscious of getting purchases back to NZ, I was severely tested). There are some tasty cafe Very quaint hotel.  I\\'ve stayed twice so far and found the rooms to be very clean and the staff very enjoyable to deal with. Their complimentary breakfast is not extensive, but very good nonetheless.  I would definitely recommend this hotel! We stayed for three nights in October choosing this hotel because of its location in Haight Ashbury.  The hotel is a characterful old building ,the ground floor has a reception area, with really friendly and helpful staff, a guest breakfast come dining room. This offers free tea and coffee 24 hours a day as well as a weekdays cheese and wine event late afternoon between 5 - 7pm.This was a nice way to meet and chat to fellow guests.  Breakfast was fine, a mix of continental and cooked sausages and bacon, unlimited you just help yourself. Unusual for the USA but a very welcome addition.  Our room unfortunately was a real disappointment, very dark and poorly ventilated no air con  or ceiling fans. We had to put the light on when we were in the room. The room had two single beds, Charming historic hotel that has been lovingly restored and updated.  The hotel is directly across the street from Golden Gate Park. Bus service is very convenient. The hotel offers tea time in mid afternoon and a wine and cheese time in early evening. Breakfast is also included in the stay. Desk staff are friendly and helpful. Housekeeping does an excellent job.  Rooms do not have coffee makers, fridges or microwaves. It’s a small hotel near the (huge) park. One could say it’s a bit quaint. Anyway overall it was a nice hotel with a nice sized room, tasty breakfast and friendly staff. I only wish the windows had a little bit more sound insulation and the bathroom had more storage space. Nice Victorian style hotel opposite Golden Gate Park so great for walks there and just a short stroll to Haight Ashbury where you can pick up the Bohemian vibe and eat some good noodles. The room we had was light, spacious and clean with a very comfortable bed and good bathroom with readily available hot water. We looked out over the main street but it was no noisier than you would expect from being in a City. The staff were mainly friendly, particularly the younger people and the breakfast and early-evening complimentary wine and cheese (Monday to Friday) was good although there was more emphasis on the wine than the cheese. I would definitely stay here again as it is good value for money in a location we particularly liked. This hotel is listed on the National Historical Register. It is a great place to stay. It\\'s not fancy but it is clean and comfortable. Staff is great. Afternoon tea and wine and cheese reception is a nice touch. I will definitely stay here again if I\\'m in the San Francisco area. Recently stayed at the Stanyan with a friend for 2 nights.  An old San Francisco style building which I LOVED and the room was great.  Really wish they had a fridge and safe in the room but everything else was very good.  Breakfast was really all you need. The cheese at Wine hour was not very good given how good cheese in San Francisco can be (and that includes the bread...spring for some Boudin with the price you charge), but the service was good, everything was clean, and the position of the hotel was awesome because it\\'s right at the start of Golden Gate park so there were tons of lovely walks to be had.  The hotel is right off Haight so not too far to Haight/Ashbury but that can get pretty seedy with homeless so be warned.  Some good restaurants well within walking distance. I’ll be brief: failed to notify us of a room change, packed our things without our permission including crumpling up suits oh and stealing all the cash from my wallet along the way as well as a credit card. Nice. I could go on about the nasty disinfectant smell, the cheesy patterned carpets and the fact that there was literally nowhere to put anything in the bathroom other than on the floor but I’ll stick with the mishandling of our property and the theft. Stayed for 10 days in September 2019. Easy to check in and friendly staff. Room was quite small, adequate, but as they say you get what you pay for. The only thing was the window was 3 feet away from next building and therefore, no view and little sunlight. Breakfast selection was very good and was an excellent start to each day. Staff at reception very helpful and gave good advice and direction. The hotel is situated in good neighbourhood, with bus and street car a short walk away. Would definitely recommend this hotel to others. We stayed here to use as a base to explore this area after staying in Las Vegas, The Grand Canyon and Monument Valley. I was dis appointed at first as the room was really small just one queen bed to share, our window looked out on another rooms window, no air conditioning. We didn’t get great house keeping and had to ask for our bins to be emptied and towels replaced. The location: the area is very nice but a long way from most of the attractions. It cost us €20 each way to get into the main town.  Positive points: the breakfast was good and plentiful, they also offered  free wine and cheese each weekday.  The Golden Gate Park is right across the road and this is an amazing place to walk or cycle.'},\n",

Always up to the high standards! Perfect location, impeccable service, and stylish rooms. A definite recommendation for a remarkable London stay! Our stay at the hotel was very pleasant. I would recommend it to a friend. One of the staff at the hotel was so nice that she offered us her umbrella while it was pouring rain outside. Her name is Stella. Thank you so much!

Stella Mubashir and Easterna one team ad well cooperated. they fiund the best solution for our way back to our country. The only issue was the ac as it was too hot. the hotel is also near the train station.  This hotel goes above and beyond. Not only did they communicate consistently, timely, and answer all questions they went above and beyond when I told them it was my niece’s birthday.  They provided a special note and cake for her making the trip so memorable not because the hotel was beautiful or centrally located, but because the experience was perfect.  Thank you! Jeana Easteina is very patient for me. Although my English is not good, she can speak slowly with me and be enthusiastic to me. And she helps me solve my problems of luggage and key cards. I like her very much!!! hotel is very convenient and all the staff are very friendly and nice environment especially Mr Mubashir & Tamara & Jeana are very help and breakfast was amazing and they gave me fruits and water when it needed nice hotel  Our stay as a family at The Park Grand London Hyde Park Hotel was Very comfortable, The Location is Very Convenient to Central London, especially for Having a Day experience in The Metropolis, Very convenient to Paddington Station, with full English and buffet style breakfast, We stayed as a family, ample off street parking to say that you are located in the centre of London, The Managers Peter and Mubashir made Our stay most excellent by allowing us to leave our car for a small fee whilst We spent another day in Central London!!! The Location is absolutely fabulous… with close links for embassy visits, London days out, closest Underground station is Paddington station… Hyde Park within walking distance… The hotel is convenient to Paddington Station which is great.  Thats where great ends.  There were biscuits and tea which was nice.  We booked in August for December at just under $400 per night we were underwhelmed.  The basement room was too small to open our suitcase and be able to move in the room.  I understand why the bed cover is dirty - it’s the only spot big enough for a suitcase. The curtains were dusty and overall we felt like we got shoved in a closet.  The bed was short and sagged in the middle.  We were expected to use a space heater.    The last comment is the sound rodents moving through the walls/ceiling.  Lots of other options out there.  Keep looking. Extremely happy with the help and hospitality at the hotel. Staff is friendly, helpful and pleasant. Many thanks to Mubashir and Xavier who accommodated our requests and made us feel welcome. Rooms are decently sized for London standards with great cleaning staff who would tidy up everyday in the morning. The reseption employees was the treasure of the hotel.Friendly and polite ,they help us with all the information that we needed and a lot of other needs that we had.Stella and all the other staff were absolutely wonderful. Our room had an odour and we had to take two stairs without elevator.Our bathroom was very cold but they provide an extra heater. We make our check in earlier and they still let us inside the room. The hotel is so central and very comfortable to my requests. First I had a room on the first floor reachable through stairs than Stella, one of the staff was so nice to change me the room to a room accessible via elevator and much better. Jeans and mubashir were kind too. I will definitely suggest this hotel to my collegues and come back again.  I stayed in this hotel during the Christmas period when everything was closed and I really enjoyed it. This hotel is highly recommended for his excellent staff as the young lady at reception Stella and the gentleman Mubashir very nice person. My rooms was very clean and spacious. I asked for some dental kits and all the staff was so kind to give it to me. The hotel is also close to the Little Venice, a very nice attraction area of Paddington. Great experience for christmas Very good location close by paddington station. Staff were very professional, especially stella at the reception. She was very helpfull and provided some usefull tips to make our trip better  stella  the receptionist and hotel was extremely comfortable   The receptionist was really helpful and kind to guide with things to do  She was very friendly and helpful   Nicoleta was amazing too. Zhe satisfied all our request Mudassir & siddarth were very friendly and they welcomed us and help us with everything we asked for they make sure everything is clean and ready and the hotel was perfect near to paddington station and the hyde park and the centre and good restaurants near by The place is very nice and its close to hyde park and people who work in this hotel are very good people and kind , they treat the guests very good especially mudassir and siddarth, they help us a lot  Hotel is better in the London also a lot of thanks to Mr.mubashir ,Stella and Xavier  to help us and support me every time hotel location is very good all the places near the hotel and Paddington’s station is just 2 min from the hotel . The location is a “plus”, near the park, walkway to Paddington station. The room are small but absolutely quite. The breakfast was fresh and good. Not too much options but all with good flavor. All staff was very kind and receptive. Special retreats for Mubashir that helped a lot with food bookings and Stella by kindness and helpful  I’ll be back here ‘cause these guys.  The bed was nice that I really having relaxied time in there!! It was really easy to adjust shower water pressure and its temperature!! Hotel man really helped me well when I needed some dishes and fork to have dinner in my room. I recommend you to stay in this hotel overall.  Mr Mubashir gave us a very warm welcoming and all the staff there were kind hearted, he gave us a room straight away before the check in timing that help us a lot since we had a very long time, he gave us a spacious room with a very beautiful view Great location for a family. Less than a 5 minute walk from Paddington Station and short walk to Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park. The kids loved the split level room and there was plenty of space for the 4 of us. The morning breakfast was a great way to start the day and the staff was very attentive. I’m not a huge fan of scrambled eggs but was able to get a couple of fried eggs and espresso to kickstart my day.    After returning home, I noticed an extra fee in the credit card statement. It was handled quickly and refunded after a phone call to the hotel. They were friendly and apologized for the mistake.    Will definitely stay at the same location on our next trip to London. Mr mubashir and Tamara is very helpful at the front desk and the hotel location is excellent and room are small but convenient i had breakfast it excellent i will be back soon easy to access the paddington station thanks for every thing.  Got in to the room and it was like a freezer, The air con was hanging off the wall and was broke, radiator was broke, temporary small heater barely heated the room. The shower had Black hair on the floor, it was a disgusting, poorly kept tiny tiny room. Paid £130 for a Deluxe twin, got a shoe cupboard with 1 tiny bed.l, so not a Twin ar all. There are better options in this area, give this place a miss. Booked 3 rooms for 4 nights for a total of $3300 through Booking.com. A member of my party backed out the same day, I tried to cancel through booking.com and my request went unanswered by the website and hotel for a week, even after multiple emails. I made an international call and the help desk was VERY rude, constantly cutting me off and borderline yelling, and told me they could not waive the cancellation fee as it was a Booking.com policy, but Booking.com says it is a hotel policy. Neither one wants to help and are very happy to take the $1100 for the empty room. I will NOT be using this location/chain again and would advise others to do the same. Amazing property, very attentive and supportive staff,special shout out to Stella who was so kind and helpful, Express check in and check out,excellent Location, well connected for public transport,Great complimentary breakfast, Quad room we stayed was huge.Lift for all floors This hotel is only good and worth it because of the destination close to centrum. The rooms are very small, and old, the atmosphere smells bad at the hotel except for the lobby. DONT pay for the breakfast, it’s so small and it doesn’t look delicious, compared to the price you pay for it.  I can’t recommend this Hotel highly enough, truly great value for what you pay. But the very best of this hotel stands in his own personal who are highly trained and very welcoming. They are also fluent in many languages, my business partner is italian and we found out there was another italian girl working there, her name was Stella and she was very kind to engage in conversations with us and satisfy each of our requests. \"},\n",

Very good with kids. Nice and calm neighbourhood but still central. We’re coming back! Local shops and close to Kensington park and Paddington. Nice breakfast and good service.  Thanks to colston, maison, kazi and shuja. Very good service.  Very good room. Lovely food. Easy to get to good social life and restaurants from this hotel. Reception is open 24/7 so always feel safe. The room was a great size and everything was clean. It has been a really great stay here would definitely come again. The Hotel is very good .The reception staff are very friendly especially Kazi,Colston,Shuja and Maisum. They are so nice and helpful always when every I met them. Kazi was so kind to offer me a room even though I checked in 4 hours early. The staff helped me in providing the guidance to travel around to places whenever I requested. The stay was very comfortable. The staff very friendly especially for preto rhian, the room was nice and clean.  The location is not far from the underground and other transportation. Just a little thing that we did not get a room with bathtub on first night and staff is sort out on next day. Very impressive Stayed here on Boxing Day for 2 nights we arrived quite early and our room wasn’t ready so we had a stroll around, rung back at 2 and it was ready. We checked in and were given an upgrade to a club room which was really nice of them. The room was downstairs through winding corridors and was absolutely spotless and had plenty of room. Bed was nice and comfy and the towels were nice and soft. Tea  and coffee making facilities were in the room also as well as some nice toiletries. We didn’t have the breakfast because we’re not big eaters in the morning. Perfectly located for Hyde park, Paddington station and Oxford Street and we walked to most places we love a walk round London. There’s lots of places to eat around as well and plenty of pubs. Parking is available but it’s public The service so good and amazing also the room so nice and the customer name colstom kazi  shuja  rihan so helpful and very nice and the place is near from the cinter of london also , i came here to see london and for future i wiil come again thank you The hotel is ok ! The rooms are clean but a little bit small. For me the hotel deserve 4 stars but I let five stars because of the people who work there : Rihan, Delia , Shailesh, Colston, Shuja, Kazi and Koofi made my stay with my girlfriend amazing !!! Thank to all of you guys I very appreciate it and I will come back sure to be welcomed again by people like you.  Fantastic staff who made are  Trip so perfect petromela, Rohan,shuja,coleston&kazi were friendly and welcoming are arriving to the hotel 4 hours early for check in  Could a been a disaster with an early flight from Dublin  But with the very kind offer of  an early check in  On arrival made all the difference to very tired mammys with 2 excited little girls  The staff were so helpful and friendly with advice and tips to get  around London are 1st time we were going to winter wonder land  Highly recommend this hotel and would definitely return  Thank you all at the park grand hotel  Everything was amazing really good place to stay for some days and relax, i want to thank ROHAN for is education and professional work at the desk you are the best, nice room really good work cleaning the room Honestly when I went here, the 2 rooms I chose were compact, but thankfully we got a bigger rooms after contacting the reception we got a twin room, by coincidence due to an issue with the second room Mr Kazi koofi was considerate enough to upgrade that room to a club room. Coldton, Shula, Kazi, and Koofi  gave us exceptional welcome at Park Grand Paddington , London . The rooms were spotless and bed very comfortable. Close to major train stations and bus stops. I highly recommend this place. We had a very Nice stay. The staff was pretty friendly to us and we had a nice breakfast. Our room was nice and everything went really well.  Rhian and Cosmin were really nice to us also. Its a very warm and cozy place  We stayed here as a family of 5.  Very convenient location and it was easy to find.   We had 2 rooms, one had a double bed the other a king bed and a stained broken sofa bed. Showers weren't in great condition and there were broken tiles in the shower room.   For the money we spent, it wasn't too bad. This is a 3 star hotel...... with a fancy lighting system in the rooms. Unfortunately it doesn't cover over the lack of 4 star amenities.   If you want a clean convenient stay, it's great. Not suitable for families. This hotel was great, very clean and good value for money. Also close to Paddington station and the staff were also very friendly and helpful too, Colston Kazi Shija and Rihan were great. Will definitely be returning if we come back to London. Very kind staff. Rooms are confortable and really quiet. Very close to subway and bus stops to reach easily all the major spots of London.  We had to change our plans and have asked for flexibility to the manager, our request was accepted and really appreciated  I like the hotel style it is soooooo amazing！！ Also the service of the reception are nice. Rihan Colston Kazi Shuja helps me a lot:)  Me and my friend will truly live here， it is convince that just 2station far from bond street. Great stay. The hotel staff is very friendly and Check in/out was fast and uncomplicated. The next tube station is just a short 5 minute walk away with direct access to central London. Very recommendable for a short trip to see the London sights.  The 4 pillows were amazing and I slept good. The reception staff was friendly as well, Colston, Shuja and Kazi helped me with everything I asked for and were definitely working well. Also, a bit of room temperature, it can be a bit warmer next time. Kazi, Shuja, Colstra, Rihan were very friendly. We got the wrong room first, but the people who worked here offerd us a new room for the next days. The new room was very good, and we were very happy with it. The hotel was  close to paddington station, hyde park and other stores.  Staff were very friendly and helpful, great location for shopping, food and bars! The hotel was very clean with included heated floors, adjustable air conditioning and room service!  Would highly recommend to anyone wanting a central stay in London and a goodnights sleep.  Big thank you to Colston, Kazi and Shurja for making us so welcome here :) Room was immaculate and spacious especially for london. Reception area is clean and welcoming and all of the colleagues are great to converse with. We visited winter wonderland and the journey took around a 20 minute walk so perfect to return every December! Had the most wonderful stay at this lovely hotel! Staff (Petronella,Rihan,Shuja, Colston & Kazi) couldn’t do more for us, nothing was a problem for them they were so helpful as we had two small children with us, they were just amazing! Rooms were lovely and breakfast was delicious we will definitely be back for our next trip to London!  Petronella and Rhian helped me at the front desk and they were wonderful.  This was my first solo trip and I felt safe the entire time.  Room was clean, staff was nice,  all around no complaints.  Staff also was very helpful with recommendations on things to do and see as well as great restaurants in the area.  Overall I really enjoyed my stay!  Everyone was super helpful. Cleaners were really good. The bed was good and comfortable. The room was warm enough. Rhian, Tabrez, Kazi and Colston were all very sweet and kind. The location is good too. I just wanted to say a big thankyou to Abdul Aziz on reception i phoned short notice to ask if they could do a surprise for my daughters birthday and they made the room lovely for her .Thankyou very much it made her night 🥰 Nice hotel very close to Paddington station. It is nicely renovated with small, but nice room. Staff is very polite and provides excellent service. Thank you Rhian and Andrea! Hopefully see you again soon! The hotel did not live to our expectations of a 4-star hotel. We arrived early before the check in was open and had to leave our luggage and return back in the evening. To our surprise, there were no rooms available in the main building and we were offered a room just opposite in Devonshire building. I would say, avoid to go there, if you can. We booked a compact double room, so understood that the room would not be very spacious. But what we had was beyond belief. You cannot even fully open the bathroom door and had to squeeze in there between the bed and the door. The room was cold and uninviting. Even when you put the heat on, it remained cold. The walls in the bathroom constantly had some condensate on leaking towards the floor. The shelf under the basin was full of water Staff are very friendly, extremely helpful.  Location is excellent, close to train/tube. Price is good and competitive. Although the room we stayed in is a little small, it is however very clean, facilities are all in good working order The room was nice and clean! Checking in and out was quick. The hotel is also very central to both restaurants and the tube. The staff was kind and helpfull, esp Shuja, Kazi and Colston.  Perfect hotel for a weekend trip!  I spent 3 nights here. Friendly and helpful staff, nice and clean room and the Hotel is located at a great place for exploring the city. Underground stations within walking distance, Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens very close . Very nice hotel, location is perfect. Easy to go around London whereever you want. Also the staff was very helpful. Thank you all Colston, Kazi and Shuja.  Rooms were quiet and cosy ones. Aircon worked properly aswell. Most propably we will come back again. Beautiful and clean hotel. Lovely staff - Colston, Kazi and Shuja were very helpful.   Will definitely recommend. This is the 2nd time I have come and it was been amazing.    Lovely breakfast available too Great experience in the hotel great facilities super clean room comfy beds super helpful staff and a very special thankyou to colstom and kazi shuja and great location from paddington station and the tube  All well arranged, good hotel and friendly staff!  Mr kazi Shuja Colston helped us very good! The rooms where well organised and it is very close to the city center. I was here for a business trip for a couple of days. It was really nice  100% recommended   Khazi was a really great guy, he helped us with everything. Also Colston and Shuja were really kind with us in the reception.  Thank you for everything, for sure I will repeat!   Very nice staff and very professional                 The location was very good, near to the Paddington Station,  very near to the High Park also.                                                            I really recommend this hotel to anyone, the service was amazing  Always came back to a clean room! All staff were extremely friendly. Shout out to Petronela, Rhian, Kazi, and Sijyia!! I would definitely come here again in the future. The price was worth it and everything is so close by! Very comfortable and centrally located. Staff very helpful. A great stopover for me arriving from and departing for Australia before heading out of London. Would definitely book again when I'm next in London\"},\n",

Special shout out to Sahel in front of house who is unfailingly ‘on it’ for service and always has a cheery disposition. Great location. Excellent service and clean super comfy room!  Jade was a great host and made our evening with her above and beyond service! It\\'s been a while since I stayed at a travel lodge and I had a very comfortable night. Fantastic service as always from Sahel behind the bar. Always polite, smiling and first class service. Highly recommend.  Visit the Travelodge on business often and Sahel always remembers me and is extremely welcoming. Thank you Sahel for great service Close to the city, super convenient for work, relatively new hotel and all the rooms are comfortable.  Really friendly staff - Jade on reception remembered me from last time I stayed and welcomed me back. Will always stay here when it’s available. Jade on reception was helpful, polite and on point  Please stop leaving the windows open in winter after cleaning rooms.  I appreciate you’re trying to make them fresh but it takes a long time to warm them up with the inefficient heating system. Hotel was booked very last minute when train cancellations meant I couldn\\'t travel home. I checked in less than an hour after booking. Had a very seamless check-in with Esrat who gave me a complimentary upgrade. Hotel must be new - facilities and room very modern, good standard and clean.  Very convenient location for the City. Would stay again. 3rd time staying at London City, this time was a girly wkend. Booked 2 rooms with early checkin,  greeted by the lovely Esrat upon arrival who informed us that we have been upgraded to a Super Room each. Rooms are clean, comfy with the added bonus of coffee machine & treats. Location is great, as is bar area. Will def be back! For one night it was ok I suppose. The beds were so hard I felt like I had been sleeping on the floor. There was a toe nail on the floor left by previous occupants, so I\\'m guessing the floor hadn\\'t been hoovered and the TV remote control looked like something was growing in it. It looked like a petri dish full of bacteria,it was disgusting.  The rest of the hotel was ok, reception was friendly enough and we could store our bags there before checking in and the bar/cafe was busy in the evening (we didn\\'t use it).  It just needs the rooms cleaned properly. Absolute must if staying in London. So close to everything it\\'s unreal. Tower bridge and the tower only a five minute walk away. Everyone is friendly and so kind. Will choose this one again when next in London.  Spent a Friday night here. Booked a month in advance and secured it for £60 (room only). It is two minutes walk from Aldgate station. Check in was swift and receptionist Baily (SIC) informed me I had been upgraded to a ‘Super room’. At first glance it appeared only the furnishings were a bit plusher,  but I later discovered it had a coffee machine and a couple of Kit Kats. Room was clean and bed comfortable. Can’t complain about the price given it is central London - would stay again. One of the nicer Travelodges I’ve stayed in with lovely staff but was only made aware of substantial construction works after making non refundable booking. Travelodge should be more transparent up front. Great check-in experience, I made a mistake with my booking but Bailey on reception was on it straight away and sorted everything out. In a super room with coffee machine and good bed. Good location for work This is our \"go to\" Travelodge. Clean, well maintained, not too old. And great for access to Liverpool St, Aldgate and Aldgate East. We had a problem with our room on this occasion, but Esrat dealt with it very professionally, quickly moving us to a different room.  Friendly staff and clean room with a nice bath. Esrat in the reception was kind enough to upgrade our room at no extra charge. The rooms were not sound proof, but people were considerate so it did not bother us. We had some trouble with the AC unit but the staff were friendly and helpful. We have just returned from our first stay at this hotel and were very impressed with the standard, location and breakfast served. We use Travelodge a lot but this was one of the best and well worth the money paid for a central hotel in London I had a horrendous time trying to vacate my room, the key wouldn’t work, I went to reception 4 times and nobody was willing to help just replace keys which again didn’t work! Turned and wonderful stay into a nightmare!   I had timed my journey via underground - Heathrow express to Heathrow to catch a flight and was quite comfortable with my journey but after 1/2 hour, I was beginning to feel stressed and concerned that I would miss my flight as my luggage and passport were locked in my room!  I found your staff to be incompetent and unhelpful, I asked several times if someone could come back to my room (on the 6th floor) and let me in with a master key and was told reception couldn’t leave the desk, when actually I had to wait twice while dealing with my issue as nobody was We stayed here for two nights whilst exploring the city.  Great location, close to Aldgate tube station and within walking distance of Spitalfields Market and Tower Bridge.  Hoop and Grapes pub is a stones throw from the Travelodge and serves absolutely delicious food - would highly recommend. Pizza Union is close by and is excellent value for money.   The room was clean and tidy and for what we paid was great! Staff were friendly and attentive, it was great to be able to leave our bags after we’d checked out and we really appreciated the option of early check in for an additional £10. The Travelodge was quiet at night and we slept well without being disturbed! We didn’t use the bar or restaurant but both were busy and seemed to have a good atmosphere. Would definitely return to Wilson was super helpful and a lovely man!! Good stay for a good price.  It isn\\'t noisy despite being near an airport and it has everything you need for a cheap stay. Its about 40 mins on the train from the city centre. The hotel is situated close to the tube stations. You can also take a 10-15 min walk to Tower  bridge. Our room was clean and well stocked with tea coffee and hot chocolate. The bed was really comfy. I would definitely recommend the buffet breakfast plenty of choices and fills you for most of the day. Staff made this a great experience and worth the while. Namely, Taslima. From the moment we arrived she welcomed us so warmly. It was a sign of more to come. She really accommodated to us. Giving recommendations and being overall helpful. Very nice stay. When we enter the room, we found that the restroom have a weird smell, so I went to the recipient to complain. The front desk staff Esrat is really nice and helpful and quickly helped us swapped to a better room. I love the late check-outs and sockets close to beds. Very clean and modern rooms. Good location and wonderfully helpful and reliable staff. Esrat made us feel welcomed and comfortable. All this with a big smile even though we checked in before midnight. We\\'ll be coming back. Thank you.  (Pictures and Videos are from the first room)  We stayed for 4 nights for NYE. First room was very dirty unfortunately. Stained carpet, also transferred hairs onto the bed. Hairs in corners in the bathroom.  AC didnt work. Even at 30 degrees it was still pretty cold. Told them in the first night if they could clean the room the next day. Said the staff is not here anymore. Told them the next day again, all we got is a false promise. Nothing changed after we came back in the evening. Emptied one out of two dustbins. Told them again after 2 nights. Thanks to a women named Baily, who showed more interest in it and gave us another room. In this case the room was fine. Everything then was actually ok for what we paid for I would say First of all, the hotel has been recently rennovated and feels modern. Checkin was quick and professional, without queues or delays.   The location is more than convenient for all the major attractions, with Liverpool Street and Aldgate East tube stations just a short walk away.   Rooms were squeaky clean, beds comfortable as well as pillows, quiet despite the central location.   I have to underline the attentivess of the staff as we had an issue with the dispenser in the bathroom, which was fixed in a manner of minutes. Thanks Baily at the reception for helping out and managing everything quickly, making a wonderful stay.    Perfect center london location. Very easy to reach both underground both bus station. Me and my gf had a great time, entire staff is very professional and client supportive at any necessity. I have to thanks Ashik Tanisha particularly, he\\'s been polite, discrete and fully at disposal. Wish u enjoy the same stay.  Esrat on reception was extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  Only issue was door banging occasionally which woke me up.  Evening meal was good and went for meal deal and added £1.50 for the items not part of deal My original room’s sink was not working properly and so I flagged this to reception who then kindly upgraded me to a super room in no time at all - five star service from Baily, thank you! Hotel is also in a great central location. V.good - as always / no fuss - good value. Excellent welcome from Esrat at front desk - kind and professional. Excellent location for both business and wider London excursions. Well done Team TL London City. Quick and friendly check in by Sabrina! The room was clean, spacious and on a high floor which was perfect. This hotel is great for the purpose of my trip which was business. I would highly recommend this hotel for a short stay in this part of London.  Have stayed here before always good service. This time was greeted by Baily at reception. Lovely  smiley pleasantl young lady.  Checked in with a smile. It means a lot when arriving at a hotel. Would  definitely  recommend staying  here. Good location  and excellent  service  Baily the reception girl is really amazing, she very helpful and always smiling while serving the customer. She knows what she doing, and make sure that the customers are happy.   We always use this hotel because its clean and the staffs are really friendly   After a day of travelling, and learning that the trains had been cancelled due to the weather, we did a last minute booking.   Esrat was amazing at checking us in quickly, giving us a free upgrade as well!  Fast, efficient service with a smile!!  Room is as I expected for a Travelodge. Room is nice and has everything I could need. Helpful staff, especially Esrat who welcomed me when I arrived. The room was a life saver due to the weather and being stuck in London. Hotel has a bar, good distance from city and trains We were absolutely super happy about this hotel and all the friendly staff. Will recommend it to everyone who are thinking of going to London. And of course, we will book this place when for our next trip, nou doubt! We stayed here for 2 nights in December.   Our room (a ‘superior’ one) was great, very quiet, comfortable bed, very clean. I especially liked the fact that it wasn’t boiling hot - the heating was easy to control and the window could be opened.   All of the staff are very helpful and friendly.   The location is very good - we walked along the river to/from the Playhouse Theatre, and enjoyed seeing all the illuminated buildings on the south side.   During the day we explored the local area. The Whitechapel Gallery, the Cable Street mural and Old Spitalfields Market are all well worth visiting, and we also enjoyed just walking around the streets and seeing all the different architectural styles and the interesting little shops.   Plenty of nearby cafes and restaurants. We ate in Check-in was fast. I was upgraded to superior room. Facilities were great and clean. I’d like to thank Esrat for the arrangement. She was super helpful, friendly and she answered my enquires patiently.  Paid 48-hour internet access & cut my internet access 30 minutes before check out time even though I have 5 hours left. Wall & headboard shakes when neighbours slam the door. No warm welcome & goodbye Beds are bot made “by policy” and shampoo is clearly watered down. Very disappointing and unacceptable for a 250 GBP per night hotel… for less than this I will take an Airbnb (where it is logical the beds are not made) or another hotel.  Pleasant stay. Low budget hotel so a stain here and there on the carpet is expected… but the beds are good, the breakfast is worth the money and staff friendly and hard working. Very nice hot shower! Breakfast is being stocked all the time and staff is open for requests as well.  A really disappointing room from a brand I have used for decades.  Filthy room, not hoovered from previous guests by the looks of what was left, dirty bedding and bathroom, and broken heating. Friendly staff on desk and at bar, but the room a disgrace. Staff tried to help where they could but were often run off their feet dealing with many guests with issues.'},\n",

The hotel is spotlessly clean throughout, and the staff were all fab, so friendly and welcoming.   We can't recommend this hotel highly enough, and are already planning our next trip back to stay here. This was our first trip to London, so we wanted to pick a hotel that would be centrally-located so we didn't spend hours every day just commuting to our destinations. The location for The Resident Covent Garden turned out to be absolutely perfect! There are multiple tube stations within a short walk, hundreds of restaurants and shops, and  if you want to see a show it's right in the theatre district. In terms of food, I should add that you can choose anything from quick takeaway bites like kebabs, fast casual establishments, all the way up to Michelin-starred establishments. You could also choose from Italian, Greek, Asian, British, French, Jamaican, Turkish, and just about anything else you can think of. Should you happen to have forgotten anything essential at home, there are The hotel itself and staff at the Resident Covent Garden made our stay a phenomenal experience! We visited with our infant, and they ensured we had an ample sized room that fit both us and our infant comfortably. The baby’s sleeping arrangements were already prepared when we arrived, and they worked hard to ensure our stay was comfortable on our first overseas trip with our infant. From recommendations to getting a cab reserved coupled with the perfect London location, I don’t think you can beat a stay at this hotel! Location is great and convenient. Good security system to get to the elevator. Staff were friendly and helpful.   The small room was clean and comfortable. There is a sink with built in water filter.\\xa0Nespresso machine with capsules and  air conditioning in the room.   In the area there are many restaurants, cafes, bakeries and shops. Stayed here for a few nights around Christmas. Reception staff were very friendly. Room, whilst a little small, used the space very well.  Also had most amenities you would expect from a hotel including a little kitchenette which is not super common but a good surprise .   Great location as well. Very good for walkers.   Bonus: we stayed for our honeymoon and they prepared a hand written card (including a drawing) which was very touching.   You can definitely see why they’re ranked #1 in London. A very well located hotel, easy walking distance to restaurants and theatres, also close to bus routes for trips further afield in the city. Comfortable rooms with great beds and powerful shower, the mini kitchen was a welcome feature, a home from home with a nespresso coffee machine, small fridge, and microwave. Staff helpful and friendly, a welcoming environment. Very limited public space but that was not such a problem given the proximity to cafes and restaurants, a glass of wine in the small seating area before setting out for the evening was very welcome. The location of this hotel was great. The staff were friendly and helped us with anything we needed including acquiring a cab to the airport. The room was clean, but even though I booked a superior room, the room still seemed rather small. Not a lot of room to put luggage, coats, and the trash cans were super tiny. The room was clean, but our bedding setup was less than ideal, two twin beds put together which was really uncomfortable. The most important thing to me when traveling is getting a night’s good sleep, and the uncomfortable beds made that rather difficult. Sanmugam an excellent service provider. Majntain cleaning and house keeping to its best.  A polite gentleman and empathy person.  Well deserved recognition. A men with smile and the floor supervisor Ms kalaivani presence daily and enquiring is appreciated Fabulous hotel! It’s clean! It’s close to Trafalgar Square, which is the perfect location to access so many tourist sites, and wonderful staff. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience and location!  My friend and I stayed here for a girls weekend as we were going to the theatre. It was the perfect location for bars, restaurants and the theatre. Everything was in walking distance.   The front desk were very attentive and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.  Fantastic location for restaurants, shopping and theatre. Great access to transport links. So much to do we ran out of time. The staff at the hotel were super helpful and the rooms were great. Enjoyed having  the kitchenette, with the water filter a smart idea. 100% recommend this hotel for a great stay in London. Fantastic location to explore central London.  Comfortable room with just enough space for a family of 3.  The kitchenette is useful and plenty of storage space.  Quiet - which was surprising given the location.   Friendly and helpful staff. We enjoyed our stay.   What a great hotel! Beds were super comfortable and double gazing made it very quiet. The rooms were super clean with modern decor. Reception staff were welcoming and efficient. The location is superb. We’d definitely stay again.  We had chosen to stay at The Resident as we had theatre bookings. We joined up as members to take advantage of the early check in and discounted rate. We had 2 rooms - one was not quite ready due to the previous people checking out late. Brendan took our bags and contacted us as soon as the rooms were ready with our bags already delivered to the rooms and a complimentary bottle of wine due to the delay. Fantastic service!! Great having the mini kitchen for a snack. Beds were very comfy too. We will book again!! All good reviews of this hotel are 100% accurate from location, to staff to cleanliness.   The only thing I would add is, when you leave the building if you go to your right is where most of the attractive areas are. To the left is less attractive but easy to your public transportation. Neither is bad, just that to the right and north is where Covent Garden market starts and areas beyond. Something we discovered on the second day  Can’t wait to come back.   Outstanding service, professionalism, and customer focus.  Room was extremely cleaned every day. Perfect location, close to restaurants, theaters, walking distance to mai attractions and historical places, public transportation if needed. We had a lovely stay at the Resident over New Year. All of the positive comments we'd read in previous reviews about the hotel and its lovely staff were absolutely accurate. Our room was spacious and very comfortable, and the bathroom amenities were excellent. Having a fridge in the room was a huge bonus, and the staff were so friendly each time we arrived or left. Having made the effort to travel down from the North East for the New Years Eve fireworks, we were delighted to have such a fantastic hotel as a base for our stay. Thank you to all the staff at the Resident. What a wonderful find this place was. We arrived at noon expecting to leave our bags but our room was ready, check in was efficient and Brendan was very friendly and helpful. I'd asked for a room on a high floor when I booked and we got just that with a great view over the Strand. The room was immaculate, the little kitchen a great bonus, comfy bed and fab shower. There was a welcome bottle of wine too. We did not make the complimentary evening drinks due to our plans, but we never passed reception without a friendly greeting from the team. After a busy Christmas it was great to be able to knock up our breakfast to suit our own timings for he day. I had no idea when I booked that we would have the absolute bonus of seeing the New Year fireworks from the beautiful bay window of This is a GEM! A perfect location near Tibe station and piazza of Covent Garden- east in and east out. loved staff who are efficient, friendly, and knowledgeable! The rooms were very clean, lovely bathroom and kitchenette and beds and linens were a dream! Enjoyed coming back to the quiet simplicity of this oasis within the bustling Covent Garden. Can’t imagine wanting or needing anything else.  This hotel is conveniently located in Covent Garden and walkable to most everything. Charing Cross Station a block away. The staff is exceptional. They are very friendly and helpful. The room was small but very clean, updated, and comfortable for two (mother/daughter). The kitchenette is a great amenity. We really enjoyed our stay. Would absolutely recommend! Excellent service and location. Clean rooms, space and very friendly staff. Enjoy my time and property close to everything. I really recommend as location is nearby good restaurants and Covent Garden. Also, many coffee shops close and teacher district.  First time in London & we chose this hotel for its location & Tripadvisor rating. The reviews are true. Outstanding hospitality from staff. Close to 2 tube locations & tons of food & drink options right outside the door. I would definitely stay here again. Great experience  Thank you 😊 good service — We have just returned from a wonderful stay in this hotel just off Haymarket, where luxury and comfort are realised without fuss or pretentiousness.thank u😍 Awesome central location, staff can’t help enough.  Rooms are beautifully appointed and so comfortable. An absolute gem of a place in every way.  Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this Hotel for anyone wanting a central London experience.  Great location, wonderful service and clean rooms. It is very safe and secure. I slept the best I had on my vacation here. Would recommend this hotel to everyone. The location is just a short walk to some big attractions and very close to the underground. This is a lovely hotel with very friendly people working at reception which is a nice change from what I experience at other hotels when traveling. We felt welcome and cared for. The room was lovely - modern, very functional and cosy. My sister had traveled across the world to join me so I was very relieved this hotel was so exceptional. Really great hotel. Super location - so central. Really quiet and clean. Nice room.  Lovely and very friendly reception and housekeeping staff. Highly recommended. I ordered some snacks and drinks to the room and the price was so reasonable especially for London.  Will definitely stay again.  Have not stayed yet but hotel were very decent towards us.  We booked a non refundable stay for several rooms in spring 2024, and our circumstances suddenly changed meaning we could no longer actually use the booking.   The hotel allowed us to use the booking as credit against another future booking we are taking with them in May which was very helpful and saved us wasted €Ks on a trip we could no longer actually use. Looking forward to staying with them in summer 2024 Excellent hotel. Great location a few minutes from Covent Garden. Loads of restaurants and bars nearby. Very clean, very comfortable bed. Very helpful staff. There was a tiny bit of noise from the street but it is central London. Overall a great stay and we would chose to stay again Lovely staff on arrival and throughout our brief stay at the Resident.  We didn’t get chance to take advantage of the free drinks at 6pm each night.  But a great offer to meet other people on their travels. My stay at The Resident Covent Garden was a true pleasure. The hotel's location in the heart of Covent Garden was perfect for exploring the vibrant neighborhood and its many attractions. The contemporary design and chic decor throughout the hotel created a stylish and welcoming atmosphere. The room was modern, well-designed, and equipped with all the amenities I needed for a comfortable stay. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, always ready to offer recommendations and assist with any requests. I look forward to returning on my next visit to London. We were staying here for the 1st time .  We were welcomed on arrival and checked in by himalay in a friendly, efficient and courteous manner and he provided all the information we needed for our stay, including the invitation to free drinks at 6pm each night, which we couldn't attend because of existing plans.   The hotel couldn't be more central and it is so quiet.  The room was as described and had everything we needed, including the larder order we placed. It was very well organised and kept spotlessly clean by housekeeping.   We were greeted both on every departure and arrival,  including wishing us a good day or night as appropriate.  A very good hotel and its easy to see why so many people like it. Fantastically clean, welcoming and great kitchenettes in each room.   You will not come across a more dedicated team in terms of customer service excellence.  Its our 3rd stay in 2 years and nothing changes  - I cannot fault this hotel and its team.  Great location, right in Covent Garden and The Strand, every type of coffee shop, cafe and restaurant on your doorstop. Chemist and supermarket close at hand. Great transport links with an easy 12 minute walk into Leicester Square.  We are visiting again soon and will 100% only stay at the Resident. What’s fabulous hotel. Great central location off the Strand. Don’t be fooled by the exterior, once you get through the doors you realise day a gem this hotel is. Free drinks at reception from 6pn was great. Welcome and detail when you check in was fabulous by the reception staff. Room was lovely and comfortable, shower was fantastic and the moulton brown toiletries a nice touch. If you get the chance, stay in this lovely hotel. Well done and thanks. Extremely warm welcome from the reception team. Efficient and friendly service as well as being hugely helpful. Could not fault the room at all with lots of nice touches and features. Will certainly be back We enjoy our holiday trips to London and usually stay in one of the larger, well known hotels. This year's trip brought us to the Residence at Covent Gardens and we have found our new hotel. It is smaller in scale  and it has a very welcoming and cozy vibe. The staff at the front desk were consistently friendly and helpful, offering suggestions for restaurants, giving directions, and answering all our questions. The housekeeping staff kept our spacious room neat and tidy. The mini kitchen ( microwave, coffee maker, kettle, refrigerator) was a plus. The location is great, convenient to Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square, theaters, and the Tube. We look forward to our next visit! We travelled to a few places during our holiday and my husband said he had the best sleep quality in The Resident Covent Garden. The pillow and the bed was very comfortable. And the hotel offered us a free wine for our stay. Overall it was a great experience. The idea of the place is simple, and its execution is perfect. Provide adequate rooms, with modern furniture and luxurious bedding, keep them scrupulously clean, and provide impeccable service. We stayed there twice in November, for a total of nine nights. On the second round, my wife happened to get ill (bad London cold), and then have a small accident to her hand while cutting a fruit. The entire staff of the hotel showed their competence, empathy, and effectiveness in helping us address it, providing first-aid supplies and then recommendations for medical help. They could not have been more kind. They could not have been more competent.  The hotel doesn't have a restaurant, it has limited public space: but for what it does, and how it does it, it is perfect. And the comradery Just spent 8 nights here. Its is discretely and perfectly located in Covent Garden. The room was large and had great closet space. The shower was the best.  Excellent water pressure and temperature. We loved using the heated towel rack. This was a trip with my sister so we got a room with 2 twins. They were pushed right up next to each other. The beds were so comfortable. We had the best sleeps.  When we returned to The Residence Covent Gardens we were greeted like old friends returning home.  Arriving from a very early morning flight, the staff were so accommodating.  They held our luggage, took our telephone number and expedited our room to allow us an early check in.  The room was spacious and spotless with the cutest balcony ever! As always the kitchenette was stocked with tea, coffee and milk so we could unwind with a comfy bed and a cup of tea.    There was a beautiful bottle of wine and a handwritten note from Eva and the team welcoming us back   We felt so special!  Midway through our UK visit we left for a few days to Scotland.  The hotel stored our luggage so we could travel to Scotland lightly and upon our return, our room was ready and our stored luggage was\"},\n",

But clean - in the bits that matter, nice staff and great location. If noise in the corridors or traffic noise bothers you then maybe give it a miss, but if you don\\'t mind a few inconveniences like that for a price that\\'s remarkable for central London, go for it. Very noisy outside the hotel sirens galore so disturbed sleep even though I’m a heavy sleeper. Rooms were small and a little tired looking but clean. Breakfast average but could be busy. Staff all extremely helpful. Meh, they’re rubbish but if you’re lucky it’s less than £150 a night and it’s somewhere near where you need to be in the morning. It had a bath which is fairly unusual for travelodges. The stay was just as average as to be expected  The room was filthy when we arrived. The bath and basin hadn’t been cleaned and there was half a roll of toilet paper.   The WiFi never worked in a week.   I had to have my room key reprogrammed every single day. Having the staff laugh at my irritation made it only worse.   I will not stay here again. Sernila was an absolute gem very welcoming and a great introduction to staying at travelodge she is an asset to your business as I stop at many travelodge and it’s more like conveyer belt of robots well done her The hotel is in a great location, only 10 minutes wall from King\\'s Cross and St Pancras Stations. Upon arrival I noticed that the reception, bar and restraunt areas had been refurbished and were looking good. My check in went very smoothly and took a matter of minutes.   My room was fairly clean, however it was rather dated and certainly not refurbished/modernised like the website suggests, it had very dated fixtures and fittings which may have been left by a previous hotel chain. The bed was nice and comfy however across 3 nights at this hotel I didn\\'t have particularly good sleeps as you can hear everything going on in rooms around and above as well as the corridor, there is no sound proofing whatsoever.  I last stayed at this hotel 4 years ago and from what I can remember the Poor customer service. Staff don’t seem to want to help constantly requesting things to be replaced or provided in the first instance. No Wi-Fi available in room even though pay for it - staff don’t seem to care From the warm welcome to the impeccably clean room and excellent service, my stay at the hotel was outstanding. Convenient location, delicious dining, and top-notch amenities. A perfect weekend getaway! Highly recommended! We stayed for 2 nights in a twin room,beds were comfortable and clean also,the room was clean and warm. There was plenty of tea and coffee provided and you could pick up extra supplies from reception when needed.In the bathroom there was plenty of hot water, and clean towels only issue we had was the bathroom door didn\\'t shut properly. We ate in the restaurant for breakfast and evening meal both were enjoyable, The staff we met were lovely and friendly and very helpful ,check in and check out was very quick ,we asked for a hairdryer as there wasn\\'t one in the room and was given one without any problem. This was my 3rd visit to this  hotel,no its not the ritz,but you get what you pay for! Its cheap for london prices and its walking distance to kings cross and the underground Cleanliness is a problem, health and safety is a problem and with cobwebs and holes in the ceiling, smell in rooms and carpets not hoovered, would suggest a thorough look before ready for next guest as things from previous guest left behind.  If I could give this place less than 1 star then I would. We had a long travel back from Paris and stayed in this travelodge. We checked in late and was leaving early so really didn’t expect much as only needed a bed for the night. We checked in and the room was beyond disgusting. Blood stained carpets, the room smelt of awful mold, couldn’t open the windows as it’s too noises, bathroom was full of dust, even coming out the shower head. Kettle was full of like scale and dirt, made a cup of tea and it had bits floating in it, beds are camp beds so small and uncomfortable, breakfast was inedible, had to wait for 10 minutes for a coffee in a que for the machine as they pack everyone in with 2 machines, the whole place has a terrible smell too. Please reconsider to somewhere else if Very noisy, no hairdryer in the room, and quite far from the train stations. The noise was very early in morning and it\\'s was delivery trucks for Travelodge, and it was happening in the Travelodge compound / site. Staff were rude and unfriendly. I came here with two friends.  The three of us booked a family room. However we had the good fortune to have an upgrade to two twin rooms without extra charge.  I am not always a fan of budget hotels but I was pleasantly surprised.  Our rooms were warm and comfortable. I slept well. What I really liked was that there was a bath.  So often you just have to endure a shower. Breakfast was basic but absolutely fine.  I would stay here again.  This experience has changed my mind about budget hotels.  From what my friends said we all were happy with our visit.  We all thought we had value for money. Great location , comfy bed,rooms need deep clean before next guest arrives. Room had not been hovered from previous guest, plug hole in bath had hair from previous guest. No toilet brush provided.  Breakfast good value for money.  Clean and tidy , staff were lovely and bubbly Nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast had a good selection and was hot , Some rooms could do with a bit of a tidy but can’t complain for the price and location really. Would use again and the sister hotel is 5 mins away from this one so I would even give that a go in future. 😀 Comfy rooms and staff that seem to be hand picked for thier bubbly personalities. Had a problem heating the lobby so had temporary heaters. But very busy and a good reasonably priced place to stay in central London  Located approximately 10 minutes from the train station, the hotel boasts a convenient location. The bathrooms are on the petite side, and the absence of a fridge in the rooms is worth noting.   On the positive side, the breakfast options were fitting, providing a satisfactory start to the day. The affordability of the dinner meal deal is another notable aspect.   Additionally, the manager, Momo, adds a personal touch to the experience by being very friendly and actively seeking feedback. The stench of mould and mould cleaner was over powering.  The staff were as helpful as they could be, I was told that all rooms were suffering smells after a flood. They couldn’t move me but brought air freshener. The team member gagged as he came into the room which made me think it was particularly bad in this room. The air freshener helped for about an hour. I’d argue that room 109 is uninhabitable.  Yes it was a cheap price, but if it’s cheap for a reason this should be disclosed. OK, first the good points.  The hotel is in an good location, close to public transport links and in a decent area with a few shops and restaurants very close by  The reception is clean and welcoming, the staff in reception were friendly and helpful. The bed was comfy and there were teabags in the room.   The not so good points!  The hotel is tired, grubby and worn, I was on the 5th floor and the room had been repainted but really, really carelessly. There was a thick layer of paint on the walls, and woodwork, which was flaking off, but the window was painted shut and could not be opened.  The furniture was old, shabby wooden stuff with all sorts of stains and chips, and for some reason there was a second bed made up in my room - why?  The TV was filthy, so dusty behind it that Apart from the fact that this hotel is very, very tired - with stained and old carpets, very poorly fitted bathroom and general wear and tear/damage evident in the room itself, you run the risk of having the issue I had which was near CONSTANT fire alarm activation that made my stay there an absolute nightmare.   An adjoining room suffered a flood from a burst pipe (apparently, I only ever found out by talking to the people staying in that room as the staff point blank refused to tell us what was going on). After paying for early check in I was almost immediately forced to evacuate, and then after we were allowed back in (much later!) the fire alarm went off intermittently for hours. It was awful.    We received a terrible service. . We arrived after three hours of travelling for our birthday weekend away, to stay in a double room for two nights which has cost us £142. As we arrive we have been told we will need to stay in a twin room due to a flood that occurred much earlier in the day and told that we can move rooms in the morning.  This is our trip away and we are a couple so ideally we want to share a bed. We were told we could move the next (6th January) but this is an inconvenience to our trip.  We tried to come to three resolutions to enjoy our trip still.  A) we asked for any kind of room upgrade B) we asked for a partial refund as we are receiving a poorer service  C) we asked to be moved to a different travelodge within the vicinity   Someone could have at least We book and pay for double beds, we got 2 single beds. The hotel promise we will changes rooms next day, but next day the say no… no service and no cleaning for the 4 nights we stay there. Dont choose travelodget  Bathroom not cleaned properly - mold and rust around the bath fittings and a dirty water ring around the bath. No hand-wash in the dispenser. They didn\\'t rectify it after saying they would. I didn\\'t expect luxury but I did expect cleanliness and comfort.  Great breakfast!! 🤤 we spend a really good time with my family. The ubicación  was great  because is close to the center of London. All hostel staff  really kind . The only thing that’s wasn’t good it’s they don’t have free Wi-Fi.  If you do not have many expectations, this is the hotel  for you. The best room for a businessman, probably not for a family. Clean room but not well equipped. Not too far from the tube station, and not very cheap. A nice budget one, where you pay only for the services you use. rooms are not very big but they are clean and the beds are super cozy. Flat screen was small, but I\\'m not a TV person myself so I didn\\'t mind. The bar is serving breakfast and dinner as well as multiple drinks and snacks. Safe for solo travellers,  and families with kids.A good value for money. Everything was great, lovely team Special thanks to Jackie  Really nice place with restaurant and bar Great location, not far away from King\\'s cross st pancras by foot I recommand this place for family Friends couples  Your main manager was the rudest and meanest man I have ever met.  I was traveling to Ukraine to see my family whom I have not seen for a while. All my mother asked is just to bring some British cheese. In the room it was boiling hot and there where no fridge. I asked to put my bag in the fridge and they declined. And then I just really politely asked for some ice at least. Your main manager was so rude , he said: “It is your fault that you assumed that we have fridge. It’s not my problem. I will only give you one small paper glass of ice” . He even called a security on me , small girl who was asking an ice. I really politely was asking and saying that I can pay for ice, please just give me another glass and he was sooo rude and mean. That was 11 p.m. so all the shops were The bathroom was dirty, the bathtub had black stains. The doors have to be slammed to be shut so everyone does it. You will ehar it through your whole night. There were not enough hairdryers and when we asked why none were available as the website specified we were told that \"hairdryers being available doens\\'t mean you will get one\". We would have brought one if we knew ahead of time. We got clean towels once during our stay, the bin wasn\\'t emptied once. In conclusion: don\\'t come here or at least go to a different Travelodge. Oh and the pictures are completely misleading. None of our rooms looked remotely like the pictures shown here, only ones like some users here have shown (the old wooden ones). The rooms need refurbishments asap. There was also a bad odor in our room. The Not worthy what you pay , and the service you get .you will end up on changing your room and getting something you didn\\'t pay for, hotel service is 0, no detergent for wash and shower , really frustrating  I would mention that the staff on arrival and check in were very welcoming and efficient.  The room basic but clean enough and cosy warm so first impressions were good.  However the shower was a lukewarm trickle, the flat pillows insufficient for a good night sleep.  We used the car park at £20 for 24hrs, it has limited space (we were lucky) and is very dirty with rubbish. We picked up a puncture, which delayed our departure although obviously cannot be sure we got it here. We didn\\'t have the breakfast at the hotel but if you just want a decent coffee there\\'s a good coffee shop directly opposite the hotel entrance. Good locazione, very close to Underground and railway station. Easy access. The room are very clean and modern confortable  The breakfast is very rich Freindly  staff and very easy check in/out. Highly recommended!    Shout out to Joyce and Kamilla Amy - two of the most lovely and thoughtful staff members we\\'ve ever met! They were a constant source of joy and energy all the way through our stay and couldn\\'t do enough for us - or anyone else staying. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. We got a great deal especially considering the fact we were traveling around the holidays. The bed was very comfortable.  Our room wasn’t very clean with the main issue being dust and hair on the floor. The sheets and towels were clean. The bathroom wasn’t very fresh either. Staff did help us out with this and offered complementary breakfast.  All I can say is AVOID!!  First impressions of the hotel are wasn’t great. The receptionists seemed more interested in hugging and chatting to each other, than dealing with customers. The reception itself was ok, but all goes down hill once you get out of the lift.  Wow the corridors are disgusting, TLC needed here!  Bedroom was vile, the carpets made me feel sick dread to think what was living in the carpets. Wardrobe broken it all needs ripping out.  Only positive is, the bed linen was clean and fresh. The bathroom was clean.  I wouldn\\'t stay here again and I certainly wouldn’t recommend.  Front desk allowed line-cut and being rude. We had to collect clean towel at front desk on the third day. No room cleaning service during the stay at all. No toilet paper or bin bag replaced. Prepare all supplies by yourself and most importantly prepare a very broad mind to accept the fact of being ignored at front desk.  I was under the impression the hotel was the \"new design\" according to Travelodge website. It did not appear to be and was dated looking. The outside of the hotel was scruffy with graffiti on walls and windows, and the area was rundown.  The rooms are not sound deadened or sound proof, as the neighbouring residents were drunk and noisy waking us up a number of times during our stay. The plus points were, the room was very clean and tidy as was the bathroom. We needed more towels (3 persons) which were placed in room, however despite us leaving used towels in bath for collection by housekeeping, they were left. Restricting movement even more as the small family room was very small !  Be warned, if you use Apple double charging plugs they do not fit room electric sockets due to This is not a hotel. Why? Because it s TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT YOU CLEAN THE ROOM AND BATHROOM EVERY SIX DAYS ONLY, NOT DAILY OR EVERY TWO DAYS!!!!! SIX DAYS!!!! And the reason given by the manager this morning is that in most of big travelodge\\'s there are so many rooms, they can\\'t CLEAN them... WHY DONT YOU TELL RIGHT AWAY???? you have to ask for New towels, New sheets, etc etc... Funny thing : in small Travelodge\\'s (like the one in the same King Cross Área) they clean rooms and bathroom... And all this is a Post Covid reason... I am surprised this place is not another great INFECTION point. Loved our stay at Kings Cross, Royal Scott. The rooms are very basic, but the staff are so friendly, especially Jackie on reception. We love her! The hotel is about 10 minutes walk from Kings Cross Station. We checked in early and checked out late for only an extra £20! We will be back :)'},\n",

Biscuits only there on first day.  Breakfast - excellent quality . All staff members friendly and polite. I saw a chef going out of his way to make a little boy something not on the menu .

From the front desk encounter with Greg to the room serve. The food from room service was tasty and made  fresh. The cocktails were impressive as well. I recommend if you’re ever in London city to stay at this hotel. Thank you for the hospitality! The stay has been perfect not only because the hotel it is gorgeous but especially thanks to the amazing people that we met. From the welcome at the front desk to the dinner at the restaurant. Food was totally tasty and the staff was really helpful and kind. Room was perfectly clean and since it was a special stay for me and my boyfriend they even set up a surprise gift for us. The attention to detail and the level of professionalism are what has distinguished this stay from many other. We will come back for sure. The bed was the most comfortable that we ever tried!! We stayed here for my husbands 40th birthday. Georgia and all the team couldn’t have been more attentive! We were looked after so well and had such a special stay. They even had balloons and cake in the room for us. I highly recommend this hotel. Lovely room and views. The best was extremely comfortable!! Beautiful hotel with a very accommodating and friendly staff. The front desk, breakfast and bar staff attended to our every need. We had a great time and would highly recommend to anyone coming to London. There is also a great rooftop bar with cool drinks and nice views of the city. I regularly use the Coffee Bar and Abdul FMB and Amin give wonderful service and an excellent experience.   Please pass on thx to them for all their great work and customer focused attitude.  They are a credit to Hilton Canopy hotel group and company. Immediately upon seeing the beautiful and abstract exterior, I figured we were in for a real treat. The room was modern, spacious, and comfortable. The hotel is also in a great location, situated just 2 minutes from an Underground station and plenty of restaurants nearby.  But above all else, the staff went above and beyond making our stay wonderful. Everyone was so kind and attentive to our needs, and even more so, everything was attended to with a smile. Honorable mentions go to Deno and Abdul for helping us get transportation to the airport when we were running late.  A huge shout out to Georgia Nikolidakis for helping me surprise my partner for our one-year anniversary. I was absolutely floored by the amount of work they put into it to making it a very special stay. No other For our 5 day trip to London, I saved the best hotel for last I guess. If I knew before how beautiful and nice everything here was, I would’ve stayed here all days. Special thanks to front desk Samiksha and Vijay who were very welcoming upon check-in and got us an upgrade to King Junior Suite. Everything we needed, we had in our room! The kingbed is soooo nice and comfy, we could sleep here forever. Unfortunately we’re going back to Amsterdam tomorrow, but we highly recommend this hotel to everyone, and to who will come across this review, you won’t regret staying here! We will for sure come back if we’re in London again. Thanks so much for everything! Yasmina Two nights here was a such a treat! Located very close to London Tower and the Underground (Aldgate stop), we were able to walk to lots of sights. We were upgraded to a large premium room with its own Pelaton and a double shower. The bed was perhaps the most comfy I've ever slept in! We had a 100 GBP voucher, had drinks and food at the bar that were covered by the voucher. The decor is Asian-inspired, the staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were spotless, but the hallway carpet on our floor had lots of lint and could have benefited from a daily vacuuming.  I would like to share my fantastic experience at Hilton Algate. I was with my family and we were nicely greeted at the entrance by a nice gentleman who also asked if we needed any help. We had the pleasure of meeting the senior Housekeeper, Lucia, who was extremely welcoming and helpful. I have used the lobby bathroom, which is not always the best place when it comes to busy hotels in metropolitan areas, and it was super clean and well maintained which is a clear sign of a very good housekeeping team and, obviously, well organized by the housekeeper. We will surely advise Hilton Algate to all our friends, family and colleagues as a great place to stay. Please congratulate Lucia ( housekeeping manager) for us as she definitely does a fantastic job! Ps: she’s good in cross selling I absolutely loved this hotel! The aesthetics were amazing! The room was clean and modern with great bathroom amenities.  The staff are friendly and the bar area is really cool! Will definitely be coming back here again. Close to Tower Hill and Liverpool Street station. Walter and indeed all the staff working at the Christmas lunch event, were friendly helpful and we enjoyed the traditional food greatly, that we self selected from the buffet.  The beef was delicious and the turkey was moist and tender.  The staff were very attentive and happy to share their knowledge aswell as accept advice upon the availability of gluten and dairy free options.  The live singer was talented and helped create a festive vibe.  Prices were reasonable for London, economical parking was available at Minories car park, 6 mins walk. Walter gave us unforgettable experience at christmas :) Perfect hotel for traveler i think👍🏻 Thank you  for your warmness I strongly recommand this hotel 🤴🏻  Walter라는 직원덕분에 행복하게 숙박했습니다.  가격도 좋고 숙소도 깨끗하고 조식도 정말 맛있습니다! Aldgate역 앞에있어서 접근성도 좋고 런던 타워도 걸어서 5-10분정도? 걸려서 아침에 산책겸 다녀오기도 좋아요 Best hotel in London! Amazing bed, gorgeous room and view! Food was absolutely amazing good selection for vegetarians for breakfast, friendly and helpful staff and calming environment we will be back. No noise in rooms, close to train station easy to see the sights and get into town. We came for winterwonderland which took 40mins in total. 10 mins to town or to see Buckingham place Hotel’s location is near the Underground, so it is very convenient. It is also walking distance to Spitalfields, and many shops and restaurants. Staff is so helpful and friendly, especially front desk Rahmeer, bartender Amin, and concierge Abdul. Rooms are clean, modern, bed is comfortable, love their pillows.  Thank you for a wonderful stay! I cannot knock the hotel in any single department; from reception, to the restaurant and St.Clares Cafe, to Housekeeping. Everything was absolutely fantastic and there was a consistent level of cleanliness and high levels of service across the board, I personally felt like the staff take high levels of pride in their work and it really reflects within the hotel.  I would just like to mention the reception staff who checked us in Sunday afternoon, they made the check in so smooth and relaxed, Also, the Greek gentleman who was the host at breakfast, was so friendly, warm and very eager to help.  Will definitely be coming back to stay here! Absolutely fantastic hotel. Aldgate tube station virtually on its door step, making access around London very easy. The hotel is very modern externally and internally. The room I stayed in was immaculate and very cosy. The staff were excellent, very friendly and the extra touches they done to the room for my partners birthday were not expected but really appreciated, you made it a special weekend. Will be my first choice hotel the next time I visit London.  Excelente Service, best hotel in the area, really clean,amazing  breakfast, spacious rooms and neat. everyone really nice and helpful specially Greg at front desk, i already booked my next stay in January! 100% recommended  thanks again and see you soon💖 This is the most cozy hotel I have ever been to! Everyone is so friendly! The beds are plush and the rooms are so well done! I could honestly marry the shower head. I arrived early before my room was ready and they allowed me to go down to their amazing gym area where there were private sheets and amazing toiletries. They provide headphones for the gym and even a travel adaptor because mine just so happened to blow. Wonderful nespresso machines and biscuits. Shout out to the goddesses at the front desk. They are amazing and I am an idiot for losing the card with your name on it. Big mirrors in every room, free filter water on every floor that you can fill your carafe with.  I will be back  and I will stay here. You can walk to the tower bridge or enjoy lovely eats at their roof Loved this hotel. Clean, nice style, and thoughtfully done. We stayed here a full week and had incredible service every step of the way. When we called for more towels or for help with anything, someone was at the door within five minutes.  This location is convenient to the City district and a nice break from the crowds for tourists. Walkable to the Tower of London, St. Paul’s, the south bank restaurants, and tube stations to take you anywhere else you’d like to go!   Every morning, the breakfast team remembered us and greeted us kindly. Thanks to Walter, the wonderful hosts (wish I could remember their names as well!) and the team for making the experience great. The hosts were really excellent at seating all of us jet lagged, decaffeinated travelers expediently even when a I love this day and I really love the HOTEL staff mainly feel very well, especially Celine who looked after me and got me checked in as quickly as possible, but recognised I needed a little bit of helper and was forthcoming with the  Lovely hotel in a great location. Wife and I stayed here as part of celebration for her birthday.  This was mentioned on the booking and all staff took the time to wish her a happy birthday during the stay which was lovely and appreciated  The hotel itself is lovely, modern, clean and vibrant.  The bar and cafe on the ground floor offers a huge variety of drinks and snacks and all of them are delicious  King room was spacious, immaculate and had an extra nice touch of some balloons for the stay.   As above, all staff were great but Greg and Loni at reception really made us feel extra special on the trip.  Location very close to Aldgate station, walking distances to others as well as the DLR and even a reasonable walk to some key landmarks makes this one we will definitely come We spent 3 amazing days at Canopy! Georgia, Deno, and Apostolos were absolutely fantastic, always smiling and making us feel super welcome!  We would definitely stay again on our next visit to London!  As someone who stays at Hilton Brand hotels often, this was a very disappointing stay.   For £350+ a night it should be exceptional and we were excited to try out the new 'Canopy' brand but found it lacking.  - Heat - The rooms on the second floor are sweltering so most of our party didn't sleep. This the primary purpose of a hotel and is not acceptable. (thermostat set to lowest temp and fan max, it made no difference)  - Beds - Were extremely soft, I can sleep on any sort of mattress usually but these were so so soft.  - Service - Normally a Hilton strong point, we arrived back on a Saturday night at 11:02pm and tried to order some drinks from the bar. We were told draught beer was already stopped for the night (bar closes at midnight) and no cocktails only bottles and I regrettably stayed 1 night only but this is definitely a hotel that I will remember. The entire staff is very helpful and friendly, always with a big smile on their faces. May sound silly, but this is the best and warmest way to welcome and make feel welcome a guest.  Amazing hotel, new and stylish in a very convenient location.  In a few words, a hotel that you cannot miss it!! The Canopy by Hilton is a modern, stylish hotel with spacious rooms, located just two minutes' walk from Aldgate bus and tube stations, meaning it is very straightforward to get into central London.   Aldgate is on the District and Circle lines, meaning it's easy to get to Liverpool Street or Kings Cross/St Pancras within 10 minutes or so, and around 20 minutes to Victoria.  These stations have a number of lines that take you into central London within a matter of minutes.   Upon arrival into the bright, spacious lobby, we found the reception staff to be polite, friendly and efficient and when we arrived late Saturday morning, the room was already available.  The hotel itself is very clean and well appointed with each room having access to a water and ice machine on each Great location and fantastic breakfast however that where it stops. £694 taken as a holding deposit taken at check this including a £50 security deposit which was no problem. However a further £78 held due to a “rate change” which was eventually removed. £644 taken at checkout however almost a week later £694 still being held as pending in my account despite having paid my rate and extremely slow to resolve. Leaving me with a frozen bank card and bank charges out of my control! Extremely unimpressed and has ruined an otherwise fantastic stay. Would not recommend or be rebooking Hilton. This was my second stay at the Canopy by Hilton, London City. I was welcomed by Greg, who I recognised as having helped me during my previous stay. All the team were fantastic in enabling me to check-in earlier than scheduled and placing me in my preferred room.  The hotel has fabulous rooms, a very spacious lounge and a quiet area too.  It is ideally situated for a weekend stay in London and is my first-choice whenever I visit The professionalism of several staff members made me feel quite relaxed during my stay at Canoppy Hotel. Customer satisfaction depends on paying attention to every detail. During busy seasons, it was difficult to find a table for my six family members for breakfast. Mr Walter was one of the most engaged and attentive members of the group.  The hotel is new and equipped with everything you may need. The position is perfect to move around London. Staff is frendly and helpful. Walter and Andrea at the restaurant will make u feel at home thanks Super convenient position, nice and modern building, all sorts of comforts. Extremely comfortable beds and very quiet. Staff is competent, friendly and very kind! Breakfast is very rich and high quality This will be my go-to hotel in London. So conveniently situated across from Aldgate tube station. Luxurious clean rooms with a city view with staff service impeccable. Consider it for your next London stay. Our 3rd time staying at Canopy and this time to celebrate a bday! Thank you  Georgia for putting up a nice welcome balloon decor! The Customer service, room and food has always been great in this place! The location is excellent, just 3 minutes walk and your at the tube making it easy access to get in and around city center! Will definitely be back! Our one night stay at the Canopy by Hilton London City was near perfect.  A warm and friendly welcome, a stylishly decorated room, comfortable bed and super rainforest shower (albeit with the dials labelled up incorrectly - the on/off switch controlled temperature and the temperature dial controlled on/off) made for a relaxed stay. The breakfast offering was super too - wonderful juices, nicely cooked breakfast options and a good selection of granola/nut options.   The only flaw, and a significant one, was the lack of a blackout curtain in our room. The room only came with a net curtain and this proved woefully insufficient to block out the light from the fully lit office block opposite where the lights blazed all night long. Unsurprisingly, we didn't get a good night's sleep. Excellent value for money and service!  it is conveniently located nearby the Aldgate tube station.  The staff are extremely welcoming especially Abdul from Concierge that gave us great recommendations and was always always striving to make our stay a great one.  Room was kept to high standards with personal touches by the team. We decided to try this particular Hilton hotel as it was close to an appointment we had the following day.  We are so glad we did! Our initial greeting at reception was from Ibrahim. He was super welcoming and so very helpful. The room was cozy and had everything we needed. The bed was lovely and large and very comfy. The bathroom was immaculate and the shower was nice and large too. The rooftop bar, Florratica, is stunning, we sat inside and it is decorated so stylishly. We had champagne followed by cocktails, all presented beautifully. We could have stayed there all evening! Breakfast was great, we were again given a warm welcome. It's mainly a 'help yourself' buffet, including continental options, pastries and full English. We then left our bags whilst we ventured out. On our As a birthday present for my girlfriend, I gave her a trip to London to Warner Bro's Harry Potter studio.  After the many positive reviews I read about Canopy, I decided to go for it and I can't say much more than that I share them.   Georgia a very kind and helpful person who helped me organize a little surprise for my girlfriend in the hotel room (which by the way worked out great, my girlfriend was very happy!!!). Thank you very much for your help and for your absolutely great and helpful nature!   Absolutely friendly and lovely staff, fantastic room, great location. My thanks also go to Walter, a very friendly and personable man with a great willingness to help.  My first time in London was an absolutely amazing experience, I already know I will be back. I also already know This was our first trip to London. The hotel location is great, 1 min walk to Aldgate (bus and metro). The style is modern, room was very clean and spacious, and the bed was extremely comfy. Breakfast is also great. We enjoyed every moment spent here and loved company and support of Ibrahim. He is very good with people and happy to help you with whatever you might need.  Overall, an amazing experience and we’ll love to come back again here.  10/10 BEST HOTEL I’VE EVER BEEN TO!! the personal was extremely kind and helpful. the room was absolutely gorgeous. Thank you Walter for being so kind with us and for helping us with all necessary things!!!\"},\n",

The Guest Experience Manager, January, was great and made sure that we had a lovely time. The best hotel in London! We found it with booking.com and it has an amazing style with very high quality breakfast and service ! Location is so unique and the atmosphere is like to be in the old classic hotel but in the meantime modern ! Thank you again guys Great hotel, beautiful surrounding atmosphere,great staff. Most friendly and helpful personnel in person and over the phone. Franchesca...you did great. Clean, stylish and roomy hotel that offers the best. I love my experience with every member of staff there,they lovely. Swati, you are a lovely person. Thanks for the second cup of coffee ☺️. From the start, I was treated w/ stellar service, kindness, & luxury, having been offered Prosecco by Yulia. While I was waiting for the rest of my party, the front of house staff insisted on my comfort & brought me tea/offered to carry my bags. I love thé business suite here, always so quiet and comfortable. Receptionists and staff go out of their way to welcome you. The wine in the exec lounge was again really good. The exec lounge evening food offering definitely pales in comparison to some hotels, I like a decent hors d'œuvre from a lounge , however  what they lack in evening food, they make up for in attentive service, excellent wine and fab onsite restaurant. I stayed here with work and was rather disappointed. Whilst the staff were very friendly and polite, the room was average. Breakfast was very poor - the cooked breakfast was cold and the muffins/pastries were very dry. They didn't offer any herbal teas at breakfast either. The spa cushions were filthy and need replacing or a very good clean. I have also since found out I was charged for the minibar which I most certainly did not use - I am currently awaiting a reply to my email regarding this.   Since posting this review the hotel have been in contact and resolved my complaints. I am looking forward to trying the hotel again.  Lovely hotel with great amenities and staff. Only small downside is that our hotel room was a little dusty and Bluetooth speaker in the room didn’t work but January the Guest Experience Manager made our stay that extra special. Would highly recommend the hotel nonetheless Fantastic experience at Montcalm Royal London House-City Hotel.   It is the perfect location, with a relatively spacious room and a comfortable bed.  The staff was accommodating, friendly and professional throughout all our stay - 5* I would like to thank and highlight HC Daniel, who went the extra mile and made our stay extremely pleasurable—such an asset to the company.   Highly recommended and we will be back soon. I have just come home from a stay with the Montcalm royal hotel and all I can say is wow what an amazing hotel. Really is a 5 star experience   Me and my partner went and had a night here for my 40th birthday we was greeted  by the lovely January who is very professional , kind and you can just tell she really wants you to have the best experience literally can not do enough for you .  I walked in to the most beautiful room done to a very high spec there was blooms on the bed macaroons on the table a bottle of complimentary water and the room rally was breath taking .  The spa facilities is lovely and clean and exactly what you would expect from a 5 star hotel . They have a roof top bar over looking the city with pods where you can dine for extra comfort . The breakfast is 10/10 Use of Spa only, the most amazing experience. Quiet and very clean. Staff were extremely accomodating and polite. It was a pleasure to spend a few tranquil hrs there. Thank you and will be back. Lovely location. My fifth visit and January went above and beyond again to make my visit amazing . My friend and I had the most amazing stay .what a way to celebrate our birthdays as always January looked after us  Thank you  I just have to say me and my fiancée had such a lovely time it was our 3rd year anniversary because 2 years ago I proposed to my partner at the Montcalm Royal House, so it’s only right we come back before we get married which will be this year. The Guest Experience Manager January Stevens was so amazing making sure everything is perfect for the anniversary day and I am forever grateful an absolute legend of a manager.  Moreover the hospitality of all the staff were so nice and excellent customer service, which leads me to Emily Summers she was so nice to me and my partner making sure if we needed anything that we should come to her request and because of that me and my partner once again had a lovely experience staying at Montcalm Royal House and we can’t wait to come back again This has been such a lovely experience. My whole stay was pure pleasure, mostly thanks to Daniel and Amy. I received top level service and was treated in a way every 5 star hotel should make you feel. Thank you both for the amazing stay at Montcalm Royal House. Highly recommend to everyone looking to stay in the financial district!   Best, Ivan Excellent place to stay! All of the staff were amazing especially the Doorman, Zarshed!  The ruins are discus and clean. The bathroom floors are heated, which we found lovely!!  24 hour room service from the restaurant and the food was amazing!! Highly recommend!! Lovely hotel with great rooms. Service is fantastic! If there any issues or queries these are resolved straight away. All staff are really friendly and accommodating. It was so great to be able to use the member’s bar area when booking a club room - the complimentary drinks and breakfast are a lovely touch! Pruthvish was so friendly and welcoming, thank you for all your help during our stay.  It’s great to be able to use the spa however only having a 30 minute session is a little restrictive, and you have to make sure to book in advance. Nonetheless it’s lovely to be able to use it! Very nice location, friendly staff. food was good. was recommended by a friend happy I chose them. Thank you very much, Great location to be middle of everywhere Will come back here. Dr Judith Freedman   The hotel is nice and clean, the staff is friendly, helpful and welcoming especially Claudia, she made my stay at the hotel 10 times better she’s one of the kindest, most professional people you can find and she will go above and beyond to make sure that your stay at the hotel goes as smoothly as possible, thank you Claudia and you’re one of the reasons that will make me choose this hotel again. We had the most amazing stay kn New Years Eve, the night we got married. The most friendly and accommodating staff, made special by the experience manager, January. Thank you for your generosity. We will be back! Room wise it’s one of the best hotel rooms I’ve stayed in. Can’t fault anything at all!    Stayed over for the night for the works Christmas party which was close by in Shoreditch.   From the moment I arrived to the moment I left the stay was an absolute joy!    The mulled wine while checking in was a treat! Claudia (I think that’s who checked me in) was lovely, very friendly and efficient at her job. She even remembered me this morning when I checked out and came over to say hello and ask about my stay. In fact, every member of staff I encountered were brilliant! All friendly, chatty and made it a lovely relaxing stay.   My only criticism being it would have been nicer to be able to stay in the spa a little longer, maybe an hour vs 30min as I felt quite rushed. But I totally Lovely stay as always !  All staff are so friendly and helpful, make you feel comfortable welcome and go above to help  Thank you to camellia for making our stay perfect  Look forward to staying again soon  We found that it was very pleasant to stay ther the rooms are clean an have many features such as floor heating and so on the staff is very helpful and kind especially Swuti moin she deserves 5 stars because she was always asking if we need anything also we stayed there during new year and she gave us some tips on where to go very helpful thanks for everything   Best regards Eldin This was our third time staying at the hotel and each time is a thoroughly enjoyable experience. We visited to celebrate my birthday just before Christmas and were surprised with decorations in the room along with complimentary macarons, which was a lovely touch. We would like to say a special thank you to the Head Concierge, Daniel, who went above and beyond to ensure our stay was faultless. We would highly recommend and will definitely be returning. Great hotel and fantastic amenities + staff. Especially Otilia, who ensured our stay and my partner’s birthday was excellent, going out of her way to make us comfortable. Thank you! This is the only hotel I look to use when staying in London. Location is really convenient and staff are always amazing. They truly could not be more helpful without it being too much. They have created the perfect balance. I can’t wait to stay again next year! We were very disappointed at the service of the hotel. We paid over £600 for two nights. Although we understand price goes up for the New Years Eve but surely the service should remain/match. Following are the areas we find most disappointing.  1. Although on website it says they have pool/sauna and spa, we found out at the check in desk we only have 1/2 hour daily use as a complimentary. This was not mentioned on the website.  2. No extra towels or slippers were provided to go to pool area. We ended up having wet room slippers. 3. No hot towel rail or laundry lines in the bathroom provide for wet swimming costumes.  4. We could not order any meals/room service without a QR code and the QR code we had was not working in our room.  5. We wanted to book the tickets for rooftop bar The experience was at Montcalm Royal was very pleasant all the staff showed excellent service, especially January Stevens who helped my experience at the hotel. The facilities were lovely especially the bar on the 10th floor and the room I stayed in was amazing, I recommend requesting the room 902 as it was fantastic due to the balcony view and room size. Had an absolutely wonderful stay at Royal London House. This is the second time I’ve stayed at this hotel and yet again, had a fantastic stay!  The friendly warm welcome, lovely hotel, with fab Xmas decorations, great facilities and super nice staff. Emily and the team did a fab job of making us feel welcome and even decorated the room to make the occasion special. Huge THANK YOU Emily…. Hope to see you v soon!  The club lounge was great too, highly recommend it - was really looked after by Pruthvish, thank you!     The room was lovely, spacious and great facilities. Super comfy bed too!   Had cocktails in the roof top bar, amazing views too!   Will defo book again! Highly recommend it. Exceptional experience! We went for a Christmas treat and we really had one! The good impressions started with Otilia the receptionist who was friendly,  helpful and upgraded our room to a suite. She explained what to expect re meals, room service, restaurant,  deposits, booking the spa facilities, etc. Very useful information from a truly delightful person. The suite was clean , air-conditioned and large, the bed and pillows were very comfortable and the bathroom was very clean and shiny!   The Aviary bar at the top of the hotel gave us a breath-taking view over London at night- unforgettable.  The cocktails were perfect. We had breakfast in the Aviary restaurant and there was a wide variety of food and lots of whatever we wanted on offer. One of the staff members, Angela, was Stayed at Montcalm to celebrate my Fiancé’s birthday and everything was just perfect on Montcalms’ behalf. Emily Summers, a lady within the special experiences department really went above and beyond! 10/10 Emily and all those involved. The hotel room was decorated without me lifting a finger, complimentary sparkling wine and a dessert for us to walk into and enjoy. The spa is another top notch addition, clean and comforting. Luckily we had some time to ourselves in there and we really just enjoyed the hotel. Was a brilliant stay. Only confusing aspect is the deposit, still yet to recieve it back, has been 15+ days since I stayed so that should be explained a bit further at the time of stay. However this doesn’t put me entirely staying at Montcalm Royal, definitely a Top 3 I am writing an honest review here. The hotel is incredibly beautiful from outside to the inside . The welcome was amazing with Prosecco and bubbly . ( Thank you to the lovely gentleman for serving the drinks with a smile and care)  Special mention to the beautiful and wonderful Emily ( Guest Relations Manager)  She went above and beyond to make our stay incredibly special and giving my daughter the best experience for her birthday, the room upgrade was truly appreciated and the birthday decorations.  I am truly grateful. Emily you are a gem to the hotel , thank you again to you and your team .  Absolutely 10/10 from us .  We will definitely be back  Really wonderful staff, thoughtful and attentive to all the details planned. Daniel was a star ! Kind and chilled staff, nothing was too much to ask of them.  Very grateful and a really lovely start to the Christmas season  I was very happy with the service I received couldn’t have asked for a better anniversary surprise for the mrs, I was referred to Emily she is literally the definition of amazing! She was really nice very caring about all the opinions I had on the rooms decoration and she made everything so perfect for us and we are really appreciative.  The room was lovely… very spacious, clean I loved the floor heating in the bathroom and the bed is very comfortable. The spa was lovely. Every workplace needs an Emily to ensure all customers leave happy and have an urge to come back.😄  Thankyou, Incredible stay! Memorable and attention to detail was 100/10.  I would highly recommend staying here! We came for a special occasion.  They always always overperform, Daniel welcomed us very well with amazing hospitality ! I can’t say enough about this place it was amazing . The staff were brilliant,I’ve never met staff so friendly and made our stay outstanding they couldn’t do enough for us .  The room was clean and decor was perfect and everything down to the last detail I can’t say a bad word about this place , Thank you for a lovely stay we will see you again. Everything was perfect, excellent service of all departments, especially the head of concierge Mr Daniel . Gave us all needed info and service with the most kindness. We really appreciate everything he did for us. A very comfortable stay; spacious, clean and well laid out room.   The manager on duty, Claudia, was especially helpful and ensured I had a restful stay. I highly recommend the Montcalm as an overnight location to rest at during trips to the city. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. It was such a perfect stay and every member of the team will do their very best to make sure you are always happy. From the bubbles 🍾🥂 on arrival to the most comfiest bed ever - it was just perfect! The team are always smiling, the spa is beautiful and the little touches for our anniversary just meant a lot of us. We left a very happy couple and we can’t wait to stay again! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Great location for east London and amazing staff.   My mother lin law, my daughter and I stayed here for one night on 15th December in a family suite.  The rooms were spacious and clean and well equipped. But the best thing were the staff. They could not do enough for us. My mother in law tripped on the front steps and they went out of their way to make sure she was fine. I was given the earnest of welcomes by Amy who checked me in. I was early however Amy ensured I got checked in straight away. Her level of professionalism, was what made this trip a ten out of ten for me! The room exceeded expectations from the Egyptian cotton linen and fluffy pillows to the bath robes and complimentary slippers. The snack drawer is also fully stocked and for those that need to tally relax, the Spa is amazing. This hotel is definitely 4 + starts. It's clean modern and the staff are just so professional making you feel welcomed. You will definitely enjoy your stay. It's also close to the Elizabeth line for easy access into Tottenham Court Road for a spot of Christmas shopping or a night out at the Theatre. Very nice place to stay in London. Amazing rooms and very helpful staff. Claudia  from reception was so nice, giving us tips  for place to visit and suggestion for our meals. Great experience. Best time in London\"},\n",

Not a too quality but think better level up from a Premier Inn. Liked the location, beds comfy and nice room. Would stay again thank you. Not too sure why this is 4.5 stars.  In terms of location the hotel is great it is right by a tube station close to amenities and restaurants and not too far to walk to Hyde park.  However our stay itself wasn’t good the mattress is old, very squishy, looked dirty and was not comfortable at all, the pillows were very poor too. Neither myself or my husband slept for the 2 nights we stayed. There was also a lot of mould around all the windows down the corridor from the lift to our room, and we also noticed mould actually in our room behind the main curtain. I also wouldn’t recommend the breakfast it was poor for the price we paid. All the hot stuff had been left out for a while so was cold and gloopy the fruit and pastries were nice but for the price you pay it’s not worth it. We booked in October an  executive room with two single beds, and we paid in advance. The book was confirmed and in the details said Two single beds. When we arrived, the supervisor was very arrogant and told us that we did not have two beds because, depending on the availability, we would have only one bed. We argued with him because I wrote before and paid in advance to be sure that we had it and that  wasn\\'t the agreement and he threatened us \" you can take it or leave it\".  At this moment, lots of people were arriving, and nobody had problems  except us. Actually when we said to him that his behaviour was rude he said that it was a big difference between him and us....... \"That was a serious discrimination. After a while, he gave us an alternative room  in the basement, The stay was great..its located in a nice quiet area just off a main road..service was excellent..the staff Meriem,Rinnish, Maria were very helpful..the breakfast was excellent..will recommend to couples definitely I arrived in London needing to sort accomodation at short notice. The team at Park Grand were super helpful and booked me in for 5 nights. The room was adequate, bed comfortable and bathroom spacious. Room service was attentive and performed daily. I had one dinner at the restaurant, some of the best Indian food I had had. As a sols traveller I was very grateful for the warmth and care of the staff, Alina, Ramish and Jameer. I returned a month later and chose to stay here again. Highly recommended, the staff make this hotel work. Slightly disappointing stay at the Park Grand.  Although the room was a decent size and clean, the dark wood was a bit dated and tired.  The carpets in the hallways showed signs of age and had bleach and other marks on them which made me wonder how clean the place actually was.  The breakfast was nice enough and reasonable value - about £16 per person as you could help yourself to whatever you wanted.  One big bugbear was the hotel does not allow a bag drop, so we had to take our cases around London before formal check-in.  That was a real negative to the extent we won’t be using the hotel again as a consequence.  All in all an average stay in an average hotel that could do with some money being spent on it. Compare prices when booking with other hotels and if the non-bag-drop Enjoyable stay at Park Grand Hotel, Kensington.  The room was clean, modern and comfortable.  The hotel is tucked in a quiet street however only a short walk to Earls Court underground station,  high street shops and restaurants which was quite convenient.  The front house staff, Maria, Anna and Rencila, provided  exceptional  service and were helpful. This hotel is \"grand\" only in that slightly tired hotely kind of way.  Location is good, on a quiet side street a short walk from Earl\\'s Court station.  Room is small but you expect that in central London.  Mattress was tired, but so were we so we didn\\'t care.    The singular reason we won\\'t be back is their stupid and shortsighted policy of not holding luggage.  After an overnight flight, arriving early morning with bags in tow, all we want is a place to drop our bags while we tour around waiting for room to be ready.  This is the only hotel we\\'ve ever encountered that refused. The front desk even had the audacity to suggest we might try leaving them at the off-license down the street. So if you are planning to arrive before 3pm check-in time, BEWARE. You may need to walk the Room smelled of mould... and had evidence of mould around the unopenable windows, also the lights switched were broken and didn\\'t switch off so ended up having to unscrew the light bulbs before trying to sleep in the lumpy uncomfortable bed. Avoid This was the 7th time we have stayed at this hotel, we come to London for a birthday/Christmas trip every year. We keep returning because of the comfortable, clean rooms and friendly staff. What has happened Park Grand??? Upon checking in the receptionist couldn\\'t have been more miserable. No longer a smile or friendly concierage to greet us. The room was tiny, full of condensation and well overdue for a refurb. Not one member of staff had a friendly word to say each time we passed through reception during our stay, or even made eye contact. Every time one of our neighbours closed their door the noise was horrendous. We lived with it as we didn\\'t want to make a fuss. Upon checking out we were advised that there were no longer any luggage storage facilities. As our train wasn\\'t We stayed at the Park Grand Hotel in London 17-22 October. While our room was small, from an American point of view, everything else about the hotel was terrific. Location was 2 blocks from one underground station and 6 blocks from another.  The hotel staff (Sameer, Jaffe, and Mustafa) improved our trip by their suggestions of how to get around options and restaurant recommendations. The restaurant had the best Indian food I have ever experienced. The hotel location is central to transportation and its only 2 blocks from Alfred Hitchcock\\'s former residence.  STAFF DO NOT KNOCK when entering the room!  I’ve always stayed here just to destress and shut myself away from the world! Experience is usually good, no issues.  However on this occasion 02/12/23, I booked a large room with a walk in shower due to a knee injury, but was given a tiny room (room 115 - not what I had paid for).  I immediately called receipt, and was given a large twin room in a dungeon (supposedly complimentary) (room 016) , There were 2 single beds, a bath and NO natural lighting. There are no lifts to the basement, so if you have heavy or large luggage, be mindful you may need to carry it up and down.  There were 2 single beds which is not what I had paid for, and no walk in shower, again complained and was told I had to wait for someone to zip my 2single beds We were in the hotel beginning December 2023, the people of the hotel are very kind and helpful, perfect breakfast and diner. The rooms are clean and good, so when we go back to London we will certainly book this hotel again. The underground is just three minutes walk. We stayed here for the 2nd night of our stay in London.   We were greeted by friendly staff.  The hotel is very clean and the rooms are lovely.     Large well presented rooms with muted tomes.  Clean with everything you could need.  Large bathroom very well cleaned not a mark anywhere.    Would recommend park grand if you are staying in Kensington.  It knocked the socks off the Hilton from the night before.  Thank you for having us park grand, you were delightful. 5 Stars all the way stayed at this Hotel with a Group of friends over the Remembrance Weekend , Great location with easy access to local shops , Eateries and the Underground , Hotel was everything I wanted  If this was a reasonable price I would give it 3 stars.  However it is grossly overpriced!!  It is run down and a bit dingy.  The hall ways are dark and smell musky.  Our room had orange stains on the carpet.  Micro waves in room so I think people must eat microwave meals in there.  VERY SMALL room.  We asked if we could leave our luggage for a few hours after check out. The ladies on reception told us no as there was no room. They then said yes but if our bags go missing they\\'re not taking responsibility.   If this cost £100 it would be ok to get your head down.  Over £250 for a tiny room, single glassed windows, mould and fairly uncomfortable.  Wouldn\\'t go back. A premier inn is much much better value! Although location convenient near Earls Court station.  Strange atmosphere! We stayed here  on the 23rd  of November. We originally planned on a two night stay  due to unexpected circumstances nothing to do with the hotel, we had to leave on the second day. We found the hotel very friendly. The room was lovely clean and comfortable  excellent facilities. We would like to express our thanks to the manager of the restaurant that night  he was a  lovely person sorry we don’t know your name.  The breakfast was lovely and so much to choose from., just wish we had more of an appetite. We would stay here again if the opportunity rises again. The positives - Great location for a London stay. The not so positives - Check-in experience was poor, caused by staff, hotel room was tired, bed was very soft complete with roll together. Room was located at the end of what felt like a maze of up to the next floor across the hotel and then back down somehow to to the room.  Only stayed one night, will not return. I wanted to extend my gratitude for the wonderful stay at your hotel. The warmth and professionalism exhibited by Mariia and Alina at the reception were outstanding. Their attention to detail and genuine hospitality made our experience truly special. Please convey our appreciation to them for going above and beyond. An adequate room in London but overpriced compared to where we have stayed before. To get to our room we had to go a very convoluted way which took is past staff entrances and corridors which were very unpleasant and smelly. I thought hotel was very good. Decent sized room comfy bed and good shower. My only slight negative was the room was effectively at ground level so you had to have the curtains pulled throughout. Overall a good experience I went their with my friends,they have a best room in town,and the night shift staff was really excellent,so kind and humble,they help us alot whole night,they are always ready for help Really appreciated,never seen a humble staff like thats. Thanks again they make us our stay here very nice.Will come here again . Me and my friends came to London due to delays in our flight. We booked Park grand London hotel as our primary stay. I was astonished with all the amenities, the best value for room and so many other things. We were greeted by all the lovely faces on the reception such as Mariia Alina and Rencilla.  I wouldn’t hesitate to mention Rinish as a human encyclopaedia who is always ready to help everyone. We will surely come again. We came to parkgrand hotel for our short stay. The hotel itself is a beautiful gem in central London. All the staff especially Rencilla, Maria and Alina were good and honest and polite all the times. The Gentleman at the door , Rinish used to greet every time when we pass by through reception. We strongly recommend this place for the stay in London. Thankyouu for everything First time in London and I was told that you want a hotel near a tube stop.  This one was a three minute walk away so it was very convenient.  It was also within walking distance to the Natural History Museum and Kensington Palace.  The  staff was friendly and helpful.  The room was clean and the bed comfortable.  I would stay here again. Really friendly staff, good clean hotel, both things noticeable on entering the building. The room was clean and well presented. Breakfast was varied and fresh and the restaurant, with a choice of international or Indian food, was very reasonably priced, the cheapest of our meals during our trip! I would certainly recommend it, thanks to Rencila Desmond Mujahid and the rest of the staff for making our short break so enjoyable.  the staff at the reception are wonderful, professional service with a smile. They have solved my problems with the small bed - got a big bed and much more at no extra cost. Really service minded staff. Special thanks to Rencila who has solved everything on the spot and very quickly. Also want to thank Alina, Desmond and Mujahid. The hotel is situated great, nearby the metro station and lots of restaurants. The rooms are very nice, clean and spacious. Rencila, Alina, Musahid and Desmond are very kind. They helped us to a bigger room and made the trip of me and my daughter superb. I can highly recommend Park Grand London Kensington The stay was very comfortable. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Alina, Rencilia & Mujahid are the staff who checked me in and made the process very easy. Also early check-in was accepted during my arrival.  Good hotel with perfect location and the staff is really amazing specially shivangi, jaffar, and faheem where very helpful also the day team where good. Had a great time staying here.  Recommended !!!! We visited as a group for the WTM 2023. Even their basic rooms were large, especially for London where you normally try to fit in a small box. Not here!  Connection to the public transport is excellent. Only 2 minutes walking distance to Earl’s Court Station and the area is very safe.  We have been served by Rinish, Alina and Sameer. They did everything they could to the maximum to ensure our comfort and satisfactory stay.  If you come from a Mediterranean country, don’t expect much from the breakfast, but this is the same for all over London.  Definitely recommend a stay here. Jaffer is nothing but managerial potential; he not only served me with grace and calmness, but did so in a way that made me feel safe and secure. This individual is a hidden gem of the community and I wish him all the best. We only had a one night stay on this occasion but it was just perfect. A club room, which was spacious and comfortable with complimentary fresh fruit, water, soft drinks and wine. The front desk staff are always so friendly and professional. The breakfast was good with ample choice.  We will return soon. Our stay at the Park Grand London Kensington was excellent and was made even better from the service we got from Rinish, Alina and Sameer.  Loved the location, rooms were very comfortable but the staff were so welcoming.  Would definitely stay again and recommend it.  Great location, great room & facilities.  Very handy for the underground & local to many restaurants and convenience stores.  Will definitely stay again. Faheem, Mustafa & Jaffer all extremely helpful and friendly. Excellent service, Mustafa, Faheem and Shivani looked after us well, The hotel offered kind service with friendly and helpful staff. Rooms were cozy and well-maintained, a comfortable experience. I recommended 👍🏻 good personal they were nice to us for the check in. Room cleaning not that good, just bed were done. The view was amazing and the ubication 10/10, its 5 min walking from an underground station so it was really wasy to move around london. Aweful wifi connection 😭  Stayed at the Park grand hotel Kennington for three nights. The rooms were spacious and a lovely room which had a microwave & kettle in it, we had a young baby with us where they provided us with a cot. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Rencila & Sameer were  especially very helpful & friendly. It\\'s our second time staying here & would definitely stay again, highly recommend it. '},\n",

Our check-in at reception on arrival was the best check-in experience I\\'ve ever had in the UK and made us feel like we were their only guests that weekend.  We had arrived about three hours before the designated check-in time, but our room was already ready, which was a great bonus. There was no \\'the lift is around the corner on your right\\', instead one of the doormen led us to the lift and called it for us. Shortly after arriving in our bedroom, which was immaculate and luxurious, we received a call from reception to check that we were happy with our room and asking if there was anything we wanted. After leaving our room to head downstairs for lunch I can\\'t put in words how good this hotel is!   Came for my birthday and the service and attention to detail have been exceptional.   The restaurant- exceptional, all food- exceptional,the bar- exceptional, the drinks- exceptional, the piano player- exceptional, all staff- exceptional!   You can tell that everyone working there cares about what they do and offer.   Checking in offered a drink immediately I have never experienced this before. Got a free room upgrade for my birthday there was cake in the room when we got up.   If you are thinking about booking this hotel do it!! I only wish I could stay longer.  Went to J Sheeky one evening is was garage in comparison to everything at the Chesterfield. My one regret is leaving that hotel to eat anywhere else.    Thank you This is a lovely old British hotel, classically decorated and wonderfully located in the Mayfair neighborhood of London, which makes it very easy to walk to many attractions and some of the best high-end shopping in London. We spent a week here -- my husband, our 22-year-old son, and I -- in early January, and next to the hotel\\'s location, its biggest asset is its staff. From the doorman, to the front desk, to the concierge, to the restaurant, the staff was always extremely pleasant, welcoming, and helpful.   Istvan, the doorman, greeted us with a broad smile and welcoming words when we arrived, followed by Ellen at the front desk, who happily answered several initial questions for us. A few days later, another front desk attendant, Shiham, helped me find a store where my son Brilliant hotel in a brilliant location with brilliant staff service. Our first time and wont be our last. Had a 3 for 2 discount deal so upgraded ourselves to a small suite (larger room). The staff also placed a small christmas tree in the room - how nice was this. The room however #528 does not have any drawers to unpack into. I also wish more hotels would have hooks for coats at winter time. We enjoyed a very good breakfast on one morning with super friendly staff, restaurant very busy. Now for the bar that we enjoyed each night of our stay with darn good bartenders and cocktials. A mean snowball, but not so sure about the truffle negroni. Really just a superb stay before christmas. Please read this thoroughly before you book you next stay in London. We have been going to London every Christmas for the last several years, and have visited and stay in London a total of about 12 times, (roughly), and at other locations. The Chesterfield Mayfair IS THE place to stay. Starting with the location, you are only minutes away to Green Park or Bond Street stations, so the access is quite easy and to find it is quite easy. Centrally located to all things London, this makes the location in even better for walking all over as well. The rooms are very clean, spacious by London standards, the food at the restaurant, room service, and in the bar are superb. The afternoon tea is a must do while in London as well. BUT, let me tell you the real star of the show. It\\'s We are just on our way home from a truly wonderful stay at this gorgeous hotel. We stayed here once for my birthday 2 years ago and it was just like coming home…we loved it. Shiham on reception was an absolute star and took great care of us from the moment we checked in….he’s a real credit to this hotel. We popped out for dinner and then spent the evening in the lovely bar and the singer was superb. We will definitely be back for another birthday and thanks again to Shiham, we had a great time! The Chesterfield, situated in a fun and accessible part of the city, was beautifully decorated for the holiday season. Its staff members were attentive and engaged and seemed to genuinely enjoy their work. We felt like we were part of the incredible history of the hotel and of Mayfair! Fantastic Rotary Club Christmas event. Excellent event room. Best Christmas meal that I  had over the period - very good value. Food and service was excellent as always. Christmas Pudding was the best that I have ever had.  Very friendly staff, great drinks at the bar with an amazing piano player, great location (although a bit loud with all the construction and located behind a lot of some sort that seems quite loud). The room was stained a lot on the carpet flooring and wallpaper. Other than that it was a nice stay.  We love staying at The Chesterfield when we\\'re in London. The beds are so comfy, and the rooms are very quiet. The staff are exceptional - so friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Mayfair is also very walkable and you can either walk, or jump on the Tube to anywhere you need to go.  We have stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair many times over the past 20 years and have always found their accommodations and service to be top notch.  It is our favourite place to stay in London.  The staff are always happy to help with special requests to make one\\'s stay more comfortable. During my husband\\'s and my visit in early December, I had an accident and was hospitalized for over a week, requiring us to extend our stay in London for an additional 11 days.  The hotel staff could not have been more kind or accommodating.  They extended our room reservation at a very busy time of year, allowing us to keep our room and adding accessibility equipment to the room to make it easier for me on my return from hospital.  When they heard of my accident, a get well card with messages Wonderful stay and great hotel. Charming in a perfect location. But most importantly they have the best and friendliest staff I’ve ever seen. I’d especially like to mention Jake, Sumir/t, Joszef and George/Yorgo. They went above and beyond in every way possible and I was very impressed as well as appreciative. fantastic hotel. had a great time hear with the family. food was good and a clean and professional hotel. grateful for a amazing stay. much appreciated.  found the hotel out of luck and a great place for the family   The breakfast is a full range of items, a pleasure to have good service, and a lovely atmosphere to begin your day. The most outstanding thing is the customer service. My daughter was sick during our stay and the staff was very helpful and considerate. It’s in a great location in walking distance to the heart of London. We have stayed a number of times and will continue to go back.  A real Hidden Gem in the heart of Mayfair, service, food and friendliness by all the staff is exceptional, everything made our Christmas one to remember, our little pomerian doggies  were made  so welcome  too, Would highly  recommend this Hote. This Hotel is Amazing. From the moment you walk through the door it feels like home. The staff make you welcome from the start and your every whim is catered for. My special thanks to Jade in the restaurant for making my wife feel special on her birthday. It was much appreciated. We will most certainly be back. Thankyou.  I can’t say enough great things about our stay at The Chesterfield. The staff and accommodation were all the absolute best. This was our first trip to London and we will be back and will stay at The Chesterfield again. Greta at the front desk was so helpful and honestly felt like talking to a friend you’ve known for years. Ever single staff we encountered made us feel welcomed. We also had a quick bite and drinks at the bar, had our first afternoon tea there, and a great band was playing. Beds were comfortable and bathroom had everything we needed. I will be back! As a second time guest of their afternoon tea, this is one of the highlights we have when visiting London.  The hotel is beautiful.  The staff are welcoming and friendly.  The tea experience is delightful for teenagers and adult.  We first took our son at age 9 and he enjoyed it.  Again at age 14 he enjoyed it.  The food is delicious and there are a number of teas to choose from.  Don\\'t be put off by the price as the experience and food are worth it.  We have been at the Chesterfield for the Christmas Afternoon and it has been a unique experience. It was my first time for afternoon tea the cakes where amazing the big xmas tea selection impressed. Well done to everybody for the excellent service. The Afternoon Tea experience was great, could not fault the staff they were amazing.  My kids and mum throughly enjoyed the sandwiches and cakes. A great selection of teas to choose from . A big thank you to Joseilito.  We had afternoon tea at the Butlers restaurant. The service was fantastic, especially our server, Jade, who made the whole experience absolutely magical for our 7 year old. The food was delicious and we ended up taking all our desserts home as we were too full to finish them! A nice touch was the sweet trolley which we could pick 3 different sweets each from. Absolutely delightful and thoroughly recommended.  Absolute perfection, better than ever! I have stayed at this establishment a handful of times and it’s always been great. This time however, they truly outdid themselves. We were a group of 8 and they accommodated our every need and went above and beyond for us.   The staff is unparalleled and delivered excellent care. Greta at Checkin was an absolute delight. Jade in the restaurant was helpful and cheery. But Loris really made my trip, he made me smile every single time I saw him and welcomed me with gingerbread man cookies that made my heart happy.   The rooms are exquisite, with all the finest amenities. The beds are ok, ask for a pillow topper and they will accommodate. The food at the restaurant is delicious and has a wide variety, may I suggest to get the breakfast This hotel was a wonderful stay for 3 December days in London. The staff worked hard on every request, the room was well appointed and the location was superb. The bar and restaurant staff in particular were stand outs.  Would be happy to give this our highest recommendation.  Also- the afternoon tea was top notch. My wife and I stayed four nights in mid-December on a return visit to London to enjoy the Christmas lights, shopping and theater. This was our first stay in the Chesterfield Mayfair. The traditional architecture and decorations of the hotel were exactly what we wanted. We booked a Junior suite with two bathrooms. The warm, friendly service of the entire staff was outstanding. Head Concierge Darren Briggs was a particular standout. Darren arranged airport transportation for us that worked out perfectively. But he really excelled at procuring two tickets for my wife and I to the Charles Dickens Christmas Carol performance, even though the show was sold out. Thanks to Darren’s tenacity, we were left with a great memory. Amazing! The morning breakfast from the extensive menu was Perfect for a trip with the girls. The rooms were beyond expectations. Comfortable beds and very spacious. We booked in to the afternoon tea and were so glad we did everything was perfect. Definitely be returning.  We absolutely loved our stay at the  Chesterfield - I have no hesitation in returning and recommending it to anyone that is seeking a boutique and intimate property in a prime location in Mayfair. From the start of the Reservation process. Leah and Frederica were “on it” - efficient, polite and solutions focused. The pre arrival emails from Alberto were a great touch. And on property, the team excelled. Special shout outs to Darren, Emma and Ellen who continuously went above and beyond. Ellen went the extra mile finding time to talk to our 8 year old son Saxon. Discovered that we were travelling to Lapland - and proceeded to curate a special comic focused around our pre Christmas holiday. This also included a turndown letter to myself and Saxon. World class hospitality! Bravo From the moment we stepped out of the taxi and were greeted by the doorman we felt like we were home. This is our third stay at this wonderful hotel and we were not to be disappointed. We were greeted on reception by Greeta, who was friendly and very professional, as we had arrived before our room was ready we were offered drinks whilst we waited and were given regular updates on how things were progressing. This initial service was more than echoed throughout our stay. My husband had the cheese and beer pairing which was given by the bar manager Alexandro, hope l have got your name correct, apologies if not, which he found very enjoyable and informative. All the staff are so friendly, our room was lovely and l must say the food in the restaurant and bar was excellent. If there This is our second time to stay at Chesterfield and couldn’t be happier with our experience.  We enjoyed our anniversary trip here in London. Upon arrival we were greeted by the lovely doorman and the house manager welcomed us asking if we needed anything and gave us his business card. Food, room, and atmosphere were  perfect. On departure we opted for a driver to bring us to the airport. All went smoothly thanks to concierge, Darren Briggs. Our flight was canceled and he was more than helpful to update our transport to the airport. Checkout was a breeze with the help from Heather. We recommended this hotel and we’ll be back next year! Stop everything! We celebrated my mother in laws 70th birthday with one of the most brilliant afternoon tea experiences I\\'ve ever been to! The variety of sandwiches, pastries and....champagne was, how can I make this right, a piece of art. Loved the staff, environment and/or ambiance if you will. From the moment you enter the elegant, comfortable lobby of the Chesterfield Mayfair and are greeted by the gracious, friendly and professional staff, you think \"Ahhhh, I\\'m really in London now\".  This gem of a hotel on a picturesque corner of quiet Mayfair is elegant, classic London, immaculate, warm and inviting, with a serene location surrounded by impressive buildings and cityscapes - walkable to many London iconic places and restaurants. Rooms are very clean and well equipped with the best tub soak ever after a long day of touring the city. Housekeeping is well run, efficient and neat.  Beds and bedding offer a really comfortable night\\'s sleep.  On-site amenities such as the classic bar area with live entertainment (music, singing) nightly, as well as the restaurant are Wonderful hotel that makes you feel like you are in a classic English residence.   The service at every level was outstanding.   We stayed in a spacious suite that was very comfortable.  Breakfast was delicious with several options.   We also loved the bar drinks and food as well as nightly piano entertainment.    Just amazing, excellent room and service. We were surprised with an upgrade to a junior suite, complimentary  breakfast, flowers for my partner and a special print off and message. Cannot rate higher than 5 but would if I coujd We visted the Chesterfield Mayfair to celebrate my brother\\'s Graduation! The service and attention to detail was simply out of this world! We have never been made to feel more special or well taken care of before. The staff were incredibly attentive. Special shout out to Carmen who was such a bubbly personality and made the experience all the more enjoyable! The kitchen spoiled my brother with a special celebratory cake which was appreciated! Overall well done to the entire team!  We had a great 4-night stay in this lovely place. The (superior) room was pleasant and well-presented, and we really enjoyed the fine bedlinen and comfy mattress. The decor throughout was kind of old-school but in keeping with the venue and generally well executed. We only ate in at breakfast, which was a big hit, great quality - and quantity - and servers Jade and Carmen were an absolute delight, making our mornings really memorable, thank you girls!  The smoked salmon and breads were delicious and the coffee very good too. And I loved the ample quantities of complementary newspapers, very welcome. Manager Adam was very helpful and responsive, in fact the whole team was great.  All in all, a great stay, stylish without being stuffy. Thoroughly recommended. I don\\'t even know where to begin to express how incredible this hotel is. We traveled to London over Thanksgiving weekend to celebrate my son\\'s 15th birthday, and thanks in large part to the Chesterfield, it was a dream vacation.   The meticulous and warm service begins from the moment you book. I reached out to the hotel with a question (we had booked a junior suite and I wanted to be sure they had a cot). I also mentioned my son\\'s birthday and asked if they could leave a note in the room, and requested early check in if possible. They responded promptly that they had all requests noted.   We walked to the hotel from the Bond Street station after arriving at Heathrow on Thanksgiving Day and were warmly greeted by Gregory (I believe this was his name) a doorman/bellhop. We were We stayed 6 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair and it was a wonderful experience.  The room and bed were comfortable and clean. Everyone was friendly, helpful and went out of their way to assist us. They had fantastic recommendations for dinner and helped us map out a trip to Hampton Court Palace when the trains were on strike. We would definitely stay here again! Wow what a beautiful hotel to stay in whilst in London.  Great location and the staff were amazing, from the time you arrive , you feel like you are home. Would highly recommend if you are going to London. Loved our stay there and will definitely be back. Thanks  I stayed here in 2010, 2013, 2019 and now 2023.    Love the location!    Can walk to restaurants and shopping.    The staff is excellent.    Concierge, Bellmen, Bar and Restaurant people.    Highly recommend! And would go back for a fifth time!! We had an absolutely fantastic afternoon tea experience at The Chesterfield on Sunday. They had a wonderful selection of teas, which we could change through our meal. I really enjoyed season’s special Christmas blend. All sandwiches and cakes were beautifully presented and the waited explained that we could ask for more of any type, as they just don’t want to overload the tea stand. Everything was very delicious, every part of the meal. Also, I’ve never seen before chocolate scones! Such a great idea and something different to the traditional afternoon tea. Our servers were very attentive and had a wonderful sense of humour, made us smile and set a great tone to our experience. A very nice touch at the end was a bag of sweets which we could select ourselves to take home. I'},\n",

The Breakfast was really nice and our room was very clean and comfortable. I can`t find any critcs and can only recommend it. Hotel room was very relaxing with a wonderful comfortable bed, clean bathroom with bath, shower,  lots of fluffy towels bathrobe and slippers. Excellent breakfast with lots of choices relaxed atmosphere helpful staff Great location  Nice bar and lounge area This is a lovely hotel located very close to Tower Bridge and 3-4 mins walk from Tower Hill Underground station. On arrival we were given a complimentary upgrade of our room from a Superior King bedroom to an executive king bedroom. On entering the bedroom it was nice to see complimentary chocolates and a bottle of red wine left for us.   The room was very spacious and clean.  One added bonus of booking this hotel is that it offers free use of the leisure club in the basement. The club again is great with pool, stream room and sauna. Which you are able to use throughout your stay. Lovely spa day , fantastic treatments . Cocktails in the bar after served by Shajib.  Great service very friendly . Great experience all round would definitely recommend. Girls day out. Would come back   Very relaxing   Location fantastic.  …………….. It's a very nice city but unfortunately we didn't like the hotel. The bathrooms are nicely decorated, but the staff in the entrance area is so unfriendly. I would never book through Check 24 again. Very unfriendly and rude. Promises are not kept. Overpriced and very out of touch with nothing behind it!  Breakfast not worth the money! The room could be cleaner. In addition, the carpets are very dirty and unhygienic!  We didn't get the room we booked. On the map you could also see that our room was simply given away. After we complained, the images on the site were supposed to be sample images, even though we could choose. There was a view of bricks but nothing more.  The rooms were not cleaned on the penultimate day even when requested. We only got 0.5 liters of water after My husband and I are staying at the hotel for 4 weeks before flying back to NZ, while our check in experience was not the most positive, after speaking with the amazing front desk manager, all was sorted and service has been fantastic. The service went up a notch when we dined at the restaurant on night one and received amazing service from Shajib and Donna. Nothing was a problem for Shajib at all, he provided incredible service with a smile. Donna also provided excellent service. I went to the restorant Leo’s in the hotel and the server Kazi was really nice he was a good server he was very kind and helpful and gave us good advice on what to order since we didn’t know :) and the place is very nice I recommend coming here 10/10. Good food nice hotel and the service was excellent: Kazi our server was one of the best and I can’t say enough good things about him : please go and enjoy this great hotel . Whilst the food was good it was slightly surprising ( desert) but like all the Leonardo hotels great value I recently dined at Leo's, and it was an exceptional experience. The food was delicious, and the staff, particularly our waiter Kazi, was incredibly kind, making our dinner truly special. This experience has undoubtedly earned Leo’s a spot on my list of favourite dining establishments. Highly recommend! Lovely lobby, friendly staff, enormous room, and fab pool and spa.  Excellent value and very comfortable and 1 minute walk to the tube station making it very convenient. Would definitely stay here again. Amazing hotel, fantastic hotel with excellent staff that are very friendly and knowledgeable which are there to help, the VIP lounge is well worth a visit with free drink and food for 2 hours which includes cocktails. The breakfast was so so Had a lovely meal and was really looked after by Jahidul. He was so friendly and really looked after me.  Fantastic customer service where they go above and beyond.  The meal was yummy too.  Thank you and I will definitely return. Thank you Jahidul The whole staff at the hotel restaurant were amazing and really helpful. I enjoyed my time there. JAHIDUL is your guy at the hotel restaurant. Always there to help whenever you need him. Thanks for your top service man. Respect From minute we checked in to dining at Leo in the evening, we were absolutely delighted by the care and warm welcome we were given. It was my daughter’s birthday and the staff really spoilt her rotten with little birthday gestures. One particular staff at Leo, Shajib was so lovely and gave my daughter a royal treatment when he found out that it was her birthday. He gathered his colleagues and sang a little birthday song with a lovely rich and creamy chocolate cake! Thank you so much! Brilliant! I had a wonderful experience. Shajib and Rafiz provided excellent customer service. They were very professional, friendly and sweet. It was my birthday and they made it even more special by providing excellent service. I will definitely be coming back. Thank you Shajib and Rafiz Excellent afternoon tea. Shajib and Rafiz were incredibly friendly and helpful and gave excellent customer service. Took great pictures and made our experience very wonderful for my girlfriend’s birthday. We will definitely be back, and hopefully have them as waiters! 10/10 We had a lovely dinner time and the food was delicious. We had the rib eye and the grilled chicken.  Kazi was outstanding with his service and made sure we had a lovely time. The desert was sumptuous and I’ll will sure try again some other time. xxxxx Stunning stay as always, love the spa and breakfast so much. Was the perfect way to recover after doing the Big Half Marathon. Yaonita’s customer service was absolutely fantastic, thank you ! Have stayed here nearly 10 times now and every time is perfection! This is the third time I have stayed at this hotel and was sadly disappointed this time. I was given a room on the 10th floor and the noise of passing trains kept me awake until after 11.30pm. On the second night I arrived back to the hotel, spent 10 minutes queuing for a lift only to find my room key has stopped working so off I went down 10 floors (I decided to take the stairs as the lifts were too busy). Another 10 mins spent queuing then a further 5 ar every floor. At 12.15am the fire alarm system sounded which I was informed the day after was caused by the chef cooking and the alarm being sensitive. Why was the chef cooking this this time in a hotel full of guests under a sensitive alarm system? Absolutely ridiculous thing to do. I finally got back to sleep around 1.30-1.45 Shajahan was  helpful with his recommendations and was so friendly. Plus his cherry twist drink was absolutely delicious! The restaurant was great and the hotel staff was professional and courteous. Definitely a positive experience staying at this hotel. I and my daughter attended the restaurant for lunch and were treated so exceptionally well by the bar staff, Shajib. He was so helpful in explaining the options on the menu and made a killer cocktail from melon, coconut and other fresh ingredients and a great classic Martini. His skill and service is a win for the Leonardo Hotel, Tower Hill, London.  A stunning hotel, everything about it was amazing, I have no faults! Shajahan behind the bar was amazing! He got me and my partner to try his on the works cocktails ‘ cherry twist’ this need to be put on the menu ASAP!! It was gorgeous! He was such a lovely server and I would come back just to see him again!  This hotel was fantastic. When we arrived we were given a glass of prosseco on arrival and welcomed with a smile. There was fruity water and apples in the lobby as well as hot chocolate and sweets. On Saturday night they were offering gorgeous snacks which were really well presented- gorgeous prawn bites was one of them. Great little touch. Staff were lovely and helpful.  Hotel super clean! Good facilities. We had a great stay so thank you leonardo.  Had a great time! Especially the bar man Shajahan, made us amazing, personalized cocktails. Such friendly service - would defs recommend coming to the bar for a drink. Try Shajahan’s cherry twist - best cocktail!  Clean rooms, beautiful spa, excellent breakfast! Warm welcome by staff and special thx to conciërge mr Constantin who took vert good care of us! We recommend the hotel for its good location as base to visit London due to the perfect connectivity in all directions. To visit again as a regular guest in London  Jan Vandenberghe . Beautiful hotel , lovely staff especially our waiter in the resturant named Shajib. . Clean rooms , nice views. Had a spa treatment and was the best massage I have ever had.  Would highly recommend this hotel. Only thing I would say is to maybe try and go on a week day as the spa aera gets very busy on a weekend.  The hotel is very nice, comfortable, clean, and modern. Our favorite aspect was the 2 wonderful mixologists at the bar. Crise and Shajahan were awesome! Very friendly and accommodating. They went over and beyond to make us some spectacular drinks! Would highly recommend Wonderful service. Very polite throughout our time at the bar. He also asked us very politely for our ID’s as before at other bars we have had rudeness from the staff.  He gave us a tasty, refreshing cocktail which is yet to be on the menu, I hope to see it on the menu the next time we visit. Pleasant experience, very friendly and enagaging service at the bar from Shajahan! hope he gets his cocktail on the menu :) will be visiting again. Love the decor of the bar very sophiscated and warm. Hotel was great! We had a very nice employee help with check in and offered a free room upgrade which left us with a beautiful room with an amazing view of the amazing city. Rimi helped with checkout and was very kind and helpful :) would definitely love to stay at this hotel again! Kazi was the best man ever. He makes the best pizza in the world. He was so polite and friendly and as i eat this pizza right now i appreciate his skills more and more. this hotel is great. bring all your friends and family.  Shajahan was amazing bartender and made us his signature cherry twist cocktail which was amazing! The hotel room is lovely and spa facilities were great. Only let down was the food which was a shame as we had such a nice lunch. However when it came to dinner which we had a 3 course meal included in our package it didn’t have much inclusivity for allergies or intolerances as myself have an allergy. Which meant i could barely have anything off the set menu. It was a real shame , the food was average over all and servers didn’t really seem all clued in. Which was a shame. The food was very delicious but the service was even better. Thanks to our waiter Kazi we had a great evening and good laughs. He brightened our day which we are very grateful for. We will definitely recommend it. I have to say that we were quite unhappy with our stay at this hotel. The hotel claims to be a non-smoking hotel but obviously the staff doesn't care at all. They are not interested in making their guests stick to their rules. On the entire second floor there was an extreme smell of weed two nights in a row - finally also in our room. The first night we simply accepted it, it was new year's eve, so maybe just an extraordinary night... The next night - an even more disgusting smell of weed. So I called a receptionist to change something about the situation (which had been promised to me after I had reported the first night's smells the morning after). He came to our floor and did exactly nothing. When I went down to talk to him, he seemed completely overstrained, he obviously I went to the restaurant at the hotel, received great food and experienced great service through our waiter, jahidul. He provided us with excellent service and always had a smile, thanks jahidul :) !! A great stay !  One of the greatest hotels I’ve ever been.  The hotel is located on a great area, less than 5 minutes away from 3 Underground stations (Tower Hill, Aldgate, Aldgate East).  The staff is gentle and always ready to help.  The breakfast is complete, with variety of drinks and food.  The room is large, and the bed comfortable, with shower and bathtub. The hotel has a game area on ground floor (table tennis, snooker, foosball). I’ve had dinner one night at the restaurant, and the food was great, as well as the pizzas, asked via room service. The fitness room is excellent, as well as the pool and spa areas. The only not-so-good point were the lifts… they are slow. Overall, an amazing hotel, totally recommended, and I’m sure I will return in the future ! I was a guest from Dec. 20-29, traveling with my son and his partner.  We reserved two rooms.  Check-in staff was friendly and efficient. Upon noticing my son was handicapped, they upgraded his room with a walk-in shower.   Rooms were clean and comfortable.    Service at this hotel is impeccable.  Special thanks to Umesh Dalal (Gen. Mgr), Constantine and Zak (front desk), Arnel and Ana Santos (dining room attendants).  These people were absolutely fantastic and willing to provide the utmost service to make our stay enjoyable.  Breakfast was OK.  The staff replenished the food, as needed and tables were cleared most efficiently.  Christmas dinner (buffet) was far from what we expected and certainly not worth the price.  The beef was very RARE.  Our invited British guest said rare Our stay at the Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge was a bit disappointing. To preface this, when it comes to travel, my family is very easy going and forgiving of issues here and there. However, by the end of our stay, I couldn’t wait to get out of there. I mention this because I read some concerning reviews but chalked it up to “karen” travelers who will never be happy. I think I was wrong.  To begin with, almost every single front desk staff member was not the friendliest, including at check in. We were so excited to be there and being met with someone who couldn’t care less and couldn’t even pretend to be welcoming, was a little deflating. I was hoping it was a one off, but almost every single front desk person we interacted with after was just as unfriendly - something you The hotel was great and staff were very friendly. Loved the welcome drink. Xmas Dinner was very limited which was disappointing, the turkey dish was not nice and we had to change it for the fish dish. Shajib was great and so professional.  We have been to London several times with friends in the past.  This time, many years later as grandparents, we treated our adult daughter, our son-in-law and their two teenage daughters for a five day visit from 26 - 31 December.  The Leonardo far exceeded any hotel that we have stayed in previously in London.  We expected the typical small rooms and miniscule lobby. These rooms were huge compared to other hotels in the past. We booked three Superior rooms with king beds. The girls wanted their own beds which the front desk graciously accommodated for us at no extra charge and in an adjoining room to their parents.  The rooms have robes, slippers, complimentary Nespresso coffee, teas, still and sparkling water, cookies, nightly chocolate chip cookies and  more. Daily service\"},\n",

No reply.  I’m staying here a week whilst I’ve a big project in at work, I barely slept the first night it was so cold, the second night it was on so The welcome we received was excellent, however there was a constant rattle/whistle noise in the room that made it near impossible to sleep. Alongside that was a sewage smell that lingered all night and dirty marks in the bathroom and on the carpet. Unfortunately we literally dropped our bags in and headed out and when we got back later there were no staff around so we had no way of reporting the issues. I booked this hotel as I needed somewhere cheap and convenient but it was nicer than I expected. Clean and pleasant rooms (not large but reasonable). A nice cafe/bar area with big windows and views. The breakfast I had was really tasty and fresh. Good treatment at reception. I will stay here again when going to local events. We stayed at this hotel on the weekend of 13th January for an event at the Excel.  I can't praise this hotel highly enough, the staff are friendly and professional, the rooms are clean and equipped to a high standard, and the views from the upper floors across the Thames are stunning.  We will definitely be back! The hotel is perfectly placed for the O2.  When we arrived at the hotel we managed to secure a parking space.  There are only 35 spaces.  The reception team were warm and friendly and offered advice regarding taxis. We went to the bar on return from our night out.  The service was good, I believe the drinks were a fair price.  The room was spotlessly clean and smelt very clean and fresh.  I had a great nights sleep.  Breakfast in the morning was very good with plenty of choice.  Would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone planning a visit in particular to the O2.   The hotel was lovely, friendly staff, check on was easy. We stayed for dinner and that was OK, although the portion sizes were small. Ideal location, near the Excel where we were going and the O2. There isn't much parking, luckily we managed to get the last space available. After a very long drive down to London, I would have been disappointed if I couldn't park there.  The only issue we had was the bed. It's a new hotel, lots of excellent facilities but the bed was hard as a brick! It hurt my back almost instantly, I didn't sleep well and after returning from there last night I am still very sore today.  Unfortunately, this was a big let down and is the only reason I would have to say we wouldn't return. We'll have to stick to Premier Inn from now on, the extra cost is worth it Staff great, rooms clean and tidy.  No issues.  Breakfast good and staff efficient cleaning away the dishes and no pressure rushing you from your table to let your little ones enjoy their breakfast.  Will stay again.  We asked for a quiet room so was given a top floor overlooking the 02. View was amazing. Room all clean and well maintained. Breakfast was good - warm and nice selection (we had an English breakfast). Travel to O2 was very easy - DLR to Canning Town (1 stop) and Jubilee line to North Greenwich (1 stop). Lady at reception gave us a slip of paper which told us which platforms to head for, which made it even easier. Great location to stay for that part of town, and would recommend.  Stayed here for an event at the Excel. Ideal location. Unfortunately the DLR wasn’t running but I was impressed an Uber was less than £7 from the hotel to the venue.  The hotel was clean, the room comfortable, the staff were very helpful and I’m glad I paid for breakfast and filled up for the day so I didn’t have to buy overpriced food at the event. Breakfast had a great range and was well maintained by staff.  This is a new/new refurbished venu. Very much improved since my ladt stay in an old style one (Guildford was horrible.) So would recommend this venu. Even the bar and bar food (till 10pm) was good. Easy access to docklands light rail and onwards to Abba Voyage!  Arrived slightly early, went into reception greeted with smiles by Sammy who booked us in. He was a so accommodating answered our questions and gave us all the information we needed. We used the bar and restaurant each day and were served by Megan, lovely young lady who made you feel welcome and nothing was too much trouble. Great stay. Thank you Booked to stay here after watching a show in the West End. Away from the hustle and bustle of central London. Easy to find, there’s a supermarket outside the DLR station so you can pick up any snacks or drinks you want to take back to the room. The hotel was clean and modern and the few staff we encountered were friendly. There’s not much else around the area, but you can take a short walk to Trinity Buoy Wharf (only lighthouse in London) where there’s a decent cafe to get a cheap breakfast. It’s also only a 15 minute walked to Canary Wharf, for shops and restaurants. I would certainly stay here again next time we visit London, for its convenience and price. Amazing service! The apple juice is nice, bed was soft, the people at the front desk are lovely. I like how there were veggie sausages at breakfast. The view is absolutely breathtaking and I’ve not had a proper good night’s sleep in ages before today. Thank you! Beds are firm but comfortable and made for a relaxing night's sleep. Breakfast was well stocked and prepared, and the cafe/lounge area was light and airy, thanks to the staff for their friendly and polite manner. Very friendly staff who were welcoming and extremely helpful, parents were pleased with disabled room as it was spacious and very clean, taxi booked to take to 02 and help with car parking from staff, breakfast was good and lots of choice, had a few snacks and drinks on arrival, good view from the window of their room,  Firstly great for visiting the o2 dlr 5 min walk away one stop then change for one stop on the jubilee line. Hotel was unlike other travellodges I've used. Firstly it had aircon and wasn't 1000° all over the hotel. Also had plenty of plug sockets with USB ports by the bed and around the room. If you want to park get there early though worth the extra 10 for the early check in Very friendly staff, made to feel very welcomed. The room was very clean, and I didn't hear any noise from people staying in any rooms around me. Everything in the room worked fine. The food options for an evening meal and breakfast were plenty, and very tasty. Staff and Supervisors are Very thorough and detailed in terms Customer Satisfaction And Care they Will Always Go The Extra Mile With Whatever Needs  Or Servicing  You May Require 😁  The rooms are clean and very family friendly. I’ve stayed in lots of Travelodges and this was definitely one of the best. It’s clean and fairly new, has a bar and a restaurant and the staff are friendly and helpful (a bit unusual for a Travelodge in my experience). I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs to stay in this part of London. I was working at the O2 and the hotel is just 10 mins walk to Canning Town station and then it’s just one stop on the tube so it was perfect for that. The only reason it only got 4 stars rather than 5 was because they didn’t have any normal cider in the bar, only fruity ones! Cracking views from the rooms and tasty breakfast downstairs, can’t knock it! Close to train station and parking on site makes it an easy stay.  I’m a here for work so I found the subway and burger stall next to the simply fresh shop all very useful for my lunch ect. The staff were one of the most helpful hotel staff I have ever met! I dropped my wallet and one of the staff Luciana Bratu returned it to me. Everything was intact! She must have spent some time looking for the owner to return it and definitely  deserves me to say something for her to express my gratitude. Other staff from the reception was also very helpful as they provided plaster and other materials I needed. Definitely a pleasure to stay here. The rooms also have new design and very clear bathroom. Location - 4 minute walk from East India DLR Station. Easy to find. One stop away from Canning Town which linked up to O2. We stayed for 2 days for a show at the O2 and sightseeing. Easy to get into central London.  Staff - warm & welcoming. Sometimes in a budget hotel, you find staff speak only on checking in or when leaving. This isn't the case. Staff welcoming & genuinely interested in you. Everyone says hello and has a smile on their face.  Hotel facilities - lovely hotel. Good location. Restaurant/bar on 1st floor with good 'people watching' and a sight of the cable car. Lovely place to relax with a drink.   Room - we stayed in a super room on the 17th floor. Fair size for London. The super room was a good choice to have rather than standard. Quieter floor, very clean. Very clean and tidy, easy check in and friendly staff. Location is great for the o2, only 10 minutes from the o2 by dlr and tube, although maps will day 20, it’s not accurate. Easy to find from east India station. Hotel was good value and in a great location for the O2, however the room smelt of sewerage and was very cold. The reception staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the bed in our room was very comfortable  Very friendly, helpful and professional team who looked after us as guests.  They could not have been more helpful. The hotel facilities were great, it was very clean and very well maintained, with drinks and food available at reasonable prices. Very reasonable price. Very quiet on the 17th floor. Excellent location for us to use DLR for connection to O2 Arena. Breakfast was such good value for money. Staff very helpful when asked. Drove there and car park was full but another car park well within walking distance and still reasonably priced. Extra parking advice taken from travelodge website so very handy. We had an unexpectedly decent stay in a very good budget hotel. Room/bathroom was clean. Friendly staff. Convenient parking. A nice bar/ lounge area can be found on the 1st floor and a decent breakfast is served in the dining area. Will definitely recommend and keep in mind when staying near the O2 again. Well situated for the DLR (East India) and within walking distance of underground at Canning Town. Useful to have the dining area. Clean comfortable rooms. Friendly helpful staff especially  Ishrat who worked in the dining/bar area. Great stay at the Docklands Travelodge, the hotel has been refurbished and it made it a very pleasant stay. Noise proof and fresh rooms. Staff were very attentive and helpful. Would stay again as the price was very reasonable. Very close to East India station so can get to places easily Kenya at the reception was so lovely and helpful. I had forgot something in the room to which she didn’t hesitate to assist me with. The location is convenient as it’s a close walk to the DLR station and also local shops. A pleasant stay, thank you.  Very pleased with our stay at Docklands Central.  Brilliant location - 5 min. walk to East India DLR station; 2 DLR stops from Emirates cable car; 3 DLR stops from Uber Boat up the Thames, Less than 1/2 hour on DLR into central London.   We arrived at 4.30pm and still found spaces in the carpark. Family room very clean and comfortable, with kingsize bed plus 2 singles (slightly narrow, but OK).  AMAZING view over the river towards the city. (Not sure what rooms on the other side of the building would be like.)  Tea-coffee re-stocked in bedroom on request.  Breakfast not worth having, as not very well stocked and then ran out of some things half hour before finishing time.  We were given 1622 room during our stay at Travelodge London Docklands central and the view from the room to outside was outstanding. I would recommend others to get this or similar room for great experience. Had a one night stay here and it’s definitely far superior to any premier inn, For the price it’s great value and I had late check-out until 2pm. Really good hotel would use anytime I’m in London. Bed was very comfy and room had great views of east London . Overall was very impressed  Breakfast was good. Views were excellent. Staff were friendly and helpful. On the downside, the pillows were too fluffy. Hotels need to provide people with firm pillows for those who prefer that option. Lovely Travelodge. Basic, no thrills, but very clean and well presented. Pleasant decor. Comfy beds, food is to a good standard.  We were on foot and had some initial difficulty navigating from east India dlr to the hotel as my iPhone maps weren’t accurate for the location but we got there in the end. We would happily return for future visits to the city.  The cleanliness of the hotel, particularly the sheets and the room, was truly remarkable. My stay on the 17th floor allowed me to enjoy a breathtaking view, and the room's tranquillity added to the overall comfort.  I want to extend a special shout-out to George Sammy at the front desk. His friendly and accommodating demeanour made my stay even more enjoyable.  While the service and accommodations were top-notch, I'd like to suggest considering an extension of the complimentary wifi duration. More than 30 minutes of free wifi would greatly enhance the overall guest experience.  Thank you again for the outstanding service. I look forward to the possibility of returning to your hotel in the future Very basic hotel, not value for money. Not near any amenities or public transport. The room was cramped and the bathroom was smelly. 2 out of 4 lifts were working resulting in long waiting times for the lift. I was staying there with my niece who had flown down from the USA. The usual check-in time for the hotel is 3 PM but even after multiple requests, even a check-in at 2:30 wasn't made possible.  Except that it was a nice cosy room.  Didn’t get family room as booked 2 months in advance and got trapped in lift on 17th floor for an hour. Staff didn’t know how to resolve the issue with room and it was only by another resident providing a spare bed that we could get some sleep for the night.  Very central, safe, clean and affordable for London. We didn't have breakfast but saw that it looked very good. Great that the bar/cafe stays open till late. All the staff were exceptional. Also, Jazib upon check out was just amazing. Thanks for the smiles and help JAZIB!\"},\n",

Why does it cost more to serve a £70 bottle of wine compared to a £40 bottle? Why not be honest and just increase all the advertised prices by 12.5% ? I would prefer to chose my own amount of tip. Staid at this hotel several times when it was the Amba and it always had a nice feel to it. The hotel is perfectly situated for a visit to London, warm and friendly welcome at reception and generally very clean. The room was a nice size, clean and well kept. Bathroom was very nice and there was a few complimentary drinks, snacks and biscuits, which a lot of hotels now sadly lack. There was also a reasonable choice at breakfast and all good quality.  After a good night I like to wonder back to the hotel and relax at the bar. The bar is too small for the hotel but I can normally get in to the bar or overspill. This time when we got back the bar was full so we sat in the other room until someone left. This was just after 11. A couple left just after, I went into the bar and they Fabulous hotel, facilities, courteous staff, excellent breakfast and dinner superb value for money.  Lovely rooms and beds lovely little extra touches like free snacks, biscuits and sweets. Coffee, tea making and complimentary daily bottled water.   Quality gym equipment and facilities. Visited in early January to celebrate a special birthday in London over 3 nights. Cake, card and balloons on arrival, cake for breakfast! and staff sang happy birthday on actual birthday. Room great, food great, staff friendly and attentive. Great value (had benefited from a deal). Hotel is ideally situated for buses and tube and in the heart of London. Loved the trip, had a great time and will definitely try to get back as soon as possible. Recommend Excellent hotel with great location right by the Charring Cross tube station and only feet from Embankment.  Staff was friendly and helpful, and stored our luggage until check-in time.  Rooms were spacious and comfortable, and breakfast buffet was very good.  The concierge, Andrea, was very personable and helpful, and he booked us on the Hop on Hop Off bus and gave us pointers about the trip that were very useful and helped us to have a great day.  Would stay here again next time we are in London. My husband organised an amazing getaway in London for my birthday and was wow'ed on arrival. We had VIP service from entrance to departure. The staff was very welcoming and attentive to our needs throughout. The food was tasty as we enjoyed an afternoon tea and varied breakfast. The room was clean as well. Thanks to Dr Fikelephi and her team for making us feel special. The Clermont pulled out all the stops for a visit to London for my mother's 87th birthday in November.  It was the first time we had visited for 3 years - she has limited mobility and the thought of taking her in a wheelchair was somewhat overwhelming but I had booked Sunset Boulevard as a trip.   The Clermont provided the perfect place for us for a pre-theatre lunch, with my mother's cousin - they had never met before. I had rung before to advise my mother would be in a wheelchair - and they found us an accessible table and were happy for mum to remain in her chair.  The food was excellent and very reasonably priced and the outlook was fantastic.  Eating / Drinking in a hotel wouldn't necessarily be my first port of call (I'm a food reviewer in Edinburgh) but I will definitely I’m sure the hotel and on site staff are as good as other reviewers report — I unfortunately won’t be able to confirm, because although I tried extremely hard, I was unable to book a reservation at this hotel. I tried booking directly through their own web site, which resulted in confusing error messages and multiple auths on my credit card (several attempts with different cards on different days, so it wasn’t me!), but sadly, no reservation. I tried calling twice, and wasted $33 USD on international phone calls only to remain on hold, because the accommodations department never picked up the phone. While trying/failing to get them on the phone and hoping that one of my auths would convert to a charge, their nightly rate went up and made the stay over budget for us. I resorted We stayed for one night in a deluxe room on the 6th floor with a view of the back of Charing Cross train station and office block. Not overly impressive. However, we could see Houses of Parliament in the distance.  The hotel has rich and historic architecture, high ceilings, large Georgian windows, swooping brass stair case, tastefully decorated for Christmas. While we are from the UK, it was lovely to see a relic red phone box down a corridor close to the lobby. The check-in process was very quick, our bags were taken from us upon entering and taken immediately to the room. The hotels location is ideal for those visiting the west end, (as we were) Strand, Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Sq. Conveniently backing onto Charing Cross station, one of the easiest hotels to get to in my My family and I just returned from a week long stay in London over the Christmas week.  The Claremont - Charing Cross was the ideal property for our visit.   The hotel was centrally located  on The Strand with very nice rooms and just the right amenities.   The hotel was festively decorated and made us feel like we were at home for the week.  The entirety of the hotel staff, including the food and beverage manager, Mrs. Jackson couldn't do enough for us and made our stay very special.  If considering a trip to London, put The Claremont - Charing Cross at the top of the list for your stay.   We booked dinner for 3 and were delighted with our whole experience. Generous and comfortable seating with a panoramic view of Christmas in the very centre of London. The service we received was charming and quietly efficient and the food we enjoyed was exquisite without exception. This constituted 3 3course meals, wine and coffee. It was good value for money as we have paid more  in other establishments that were less excellent. The hotel itself has a stateliness but it was warmly and sympathetically decorated. It was a delight to see the main staircase and the elegant furnishings. Already planning our next visit! Our family traveled to the UK for Christmas. Our 3 adult kids had to return to the USA on Dec 27th, but my husband and I were staying on. I chose this beautiful hotel because of the availability of 3 rooms, excellent location, and convenience getting to Heathrow. We were warmly welcomed, given free cocktails at the bar, had lovely rooms with all the amenities and had a great nights sleep. Don’t hesitate to book here for an excellent hotel right in the heart of London. This is the first year we have spent Christmas away from home & it had to be the Clermont : this is our 5th stay this year. We were greeted by happy smiling staff & this continued all throughout our stay. Breakfast time was lovely & very special thanks to Cyan & thanks to Ruvim & Faycal. We had a wonderful meal in the restaurant on Christmas Eve followed by a gorgeous Christmas day dinner. Special thanks to Konrad, Svetlana & Rosie for organising things so well; to Elsa & Keerty for being the most amazing waiting staff. Big thankyou to Daphne for sorting out the lovely room for us. The list could go on because all the staff at this hotel are really amazing.  This hotel is in a fantastic central location. It is very comfortable without being pretentious & is managed by a great Had a great pleasure staying at the Clermont Hotel for my birthday. The staff were lovely and friendly Daniel and Jemma at breakfast,  konrad ,keertie at dinner made my stay. Akshay the chef was flexible in making plain rice for my grand son nothing was too much trouble. Cristi made my Zombie the I like it. Thank you Clermont for a fantastic birthday. We booked two rooms for five nights at The Clermont based on their excellent reviews and their central location. We found the hotel to be confusing. We had to go up a flight of stairs and then cross an interior bridge connecting two buildings. Then, go down a flight of stairs to get to our rooms. The staircase smelled like a hamster’s cage. The rooms we were given were very dark and faced a narrow interior space of the hotel. There were workers outside our windows doing some building work. We could hear them speaking through the walls. One of our rooms had no hot water for showering. Both of our rooms had a queen comforter on a king-sized bed. This meant when one person rolled over, they took the covers with them. Why not put a king-sized comforter on a king-sized bed? There is The Clermont Charing Cross, London, was the perfect hotel for first time travelers to London. We are from the US and wanted a hotel that was centrally located.  We could not have chosen a better place.  The location was perfect!  It was steps away from Trafalgar Square, two Tube locations were literally on the property, and rail service was in the bottom of the hotel.  The staff was kind and accommodating and the entire hotel was EXTREMELY clean. Our room was appointed with a king bed, updated bathroom, and plenty of pillow options so we were comfortable.  The room was very clean! The downsides were minimal and hardly worth mentioning. But I will so someone else will know what to expect.  I used the blow dryer provided in the room, which was on the high end side, which was nice. Lovely place to stay right in the heart of London, easy walking routes to everywhere and good tube links.   The room was lovely, considering the age of the building and location I thought the room would be smaller, bed and bedding was really high quality!   The shower was so powerful you don’t want to get out of it.   Only small amount of rail noise, to be expected but it was so small you didn’t really notice it, view could have been better (arches facing room) but it was a busy period so it’s not really a complaint, plus if you’re going to London you’re not sitting in your room staring at the view for long really!   Service is very professional and friendly.  Best hotel I've every stayed in! I travel a lot for work and this ticks all the boxes and more. From arrival to leaving, the staff were incredibly helpful and kind (like they were proud of the place they worked and wanted guests to have the best possible experience). Room was incredible cosy and immacuately clean, and was full of extras and thoughtful details that even as a seasoned traveller, I always have to ask for, or hadn't even thought about, but very much appreciated: sweetie jar; coffee machine and selection of coffees; wide selection of teas and hot chocolate; hair-dryer, ironing board, iron, fluffy robe and slippers. Luxury bedding and bed. Shower that works, is hot and powerful and is easy to use, even without spectacles (lovely toiletries too). And a bath! Lots of We went to the restaurant for afternoon tea,  which used to be a thing in the old hotel there,  and is still advertised.   So the scones were stale and the whole thing both inadequate and expensive.   I suppose going on on Monday you might expect to get the weekend leftvoers,  but it was very poor. Work put us up for the usual Christmas party , The room was decent but not a great view this time, even though it was mostly to sleep off the hangover. The location is perfect for Central London bars, restaurants,etc... Great breakfast. Will most likely be back next year for the annual Christmas party. Highly recommend this hotel. It’s an oasis of calm right in the centre of London. You can walk to everything and it’s so handy to be able to pop back to drop off shopping or just for a sit down.   It’s a very large old hotel right above Charing Cross station but very well run and maintained. Staff are friendly and helpful. Hopefully we will be back.  Took my wife for a meal in the restaurant for a Christmas treat  The decor was amazing,staff very professional,helpful and attentive  The food itself was great,my wife is vegan and she was well catered for,all three courses were amazing  I would definitely recommend a visit  Excellent location for the places I visited and my travel preference. Only  short journey by tube from Victoria station to Charring Cross, I would highly recommend this Hotel if going to a west end Musical as you can walk out of the hotel and you’re about 5 minutes walk  to the Adelphi theatre there was other shows all within 10 - 15 minutes walk away. I didn’t eat at the Hotel so can’t comment on food, the staff where all friendly and the room was very clean there was a mini bar with some free coke and water in there as well as your normal tea, coffee hot chocolate ect and a some snacks crisps popcorn biscuits and sweets. There was lots of other facilities like gym which I also didn’t use The room they put my family and I in was awful! If reception ever say to you to CROSS THE BRIDGE… Decline immediately!!! The hotel is part of two buildings, the very nice building that smells like Christmas in the winter. Then there’s the building above five guys that stinks of burgers and terrible cleaning products! We instantly complained about this, so they upgraded us to the nicer part of the building. All is well… however the reception is sneaky!   When my mum and dad complained, reception told them they were no rooms available. But when I complained they upgraded me and told me that I would have to pay £40 per night. So we were separated for 1 of 2 nights. However the day after, my parents asked again, and reception gave them an upgrade too, but for FREE! I was fuming! At Great location. Nice breakfast buffet. Staff friendly and accommodating. Rooms clean and comfortable. Love the goodies filled in the candy dish. Nice touch. Highly recommend and would definitely stay there again! Excellent hotel, superb building in a perfect location. Beautifully presented and decorated and staff were fabulous. The room, bar, restaurant and breakfast were all exceptional. Will most definitely recommend and will stay again if we are ever in London again.  We went for a lunch in the hotel restaurant and we were so impressed with service and food. Was absolutely great. From beginning to the end.  Such attentive staff. 3 course lunch and glass of bubbly. Incredible price.  Very recommended hotel in a perfect location. Near Trafalgar Square,  underground, bus stations…theaters.  Room and bathroom are very clean, nice and good service, coffee machine, tea, sweets, cookies….Beautiful decoration in Christmas. 5 stars. Thank you! The staff were exceptionally welcoming with nothing being too much trouble. We were delighted with the service provided and the room was excellent. Special thanks to the brilliant staff on reception who were always happy to help. Hotel is well located within walking distance to tube station, Thames, and Covent Garden.  Taxi rank right outside front door.  Comfortable beds, clean.   The only reason for 4 stars, rather than 5, has to do with temperature control, loudness,  and special requests.  I had requested a bath tub multiple times but they were not able to accommodate.  The temperature of the room was hot and the thermostat did not seem to adjust temperature.  We were able to open window but the street noise was loud on the weekend. Staff was nice.   I visited the restaurant this visit but have stayed here before and the room was nice. This visit the restaurant accommodated us even though we were almost an hour late due to train strikes. Nice cocktails, well presented. Companion said vegan burger was okay. Little bit chilly where we were seated but beautiful Christmas decor. Most accommodating staff, very lovely rooms with extremely comfortable beds. The location was perfect for anyone wanting to be near the theaters. I especially liked that they offered to book a car service to the airport and the cost was the same or less than a cab. So little good to say.  Staff is untrained uncoordinated and often incompetent.  Room:  bed comfy. Bath insanely bad.  Functional furnishings are absent and the place is “tired” compared to its sister property at Victoria station.   A very enjoyable stay. Wonderful Christmas decorations throughout. Hotel smelt of Christmas! The staff at check in were so friendly and accommodating. The staff make this hotel- they were all so kind, welcoming and attentive. Thank you to the man who made me a cup of tea on arrival. The breakfast was superb and served in beautiful surroundings. This hotel is great value. The location is perfect - so central. Very comfortable room and clean- just perfect.  Highly recommend.  One issue was our shower- it went hot and cold. Was fine as we could use it but maybe a maintence issue. We were room 611. I forgot to say on check out. Thanks again- I’ll be back.  We were not staying, but arranged to meet a friend at the Terrace Restaurant, which proved an excellent choice - easy for him to reach because right next to Charing Cross Station, and convenient for us as we were going on to an exhibition at the National Gallery.  We had a good, light lunchtime meal, and we especially appreciated the quiet room (background music very muted) which enabled us to have a really good conversation in the restaurant's attractive room. The Clermont is my hotel of choice when I need to stay in London on business. I am fortunate to be able to stay several times a year and this hotel is consistently good, with great service, delicious food and spacious rooms. It is in a really good location, and the rooms are clean, quiet and comfortable. I always look forward to my stay. Highly recommended. Great hotel in a fantastic location. The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas. We were 2 adults and a teenager. Beds were very comfortable with plenty of pillows and blankets. Snacks, drinks and wine in room were free of charge so it was nice to have while getting ready to head back out for the evening. Bathroom was a great size with a fabulous shower. Hotel was quiet even though there seemed to be a lot of guests.  Although room was nice,  space was extremely limited with sofa bed opened. Storage was quite limited. Super conveniently located for walking to just about all sites to visit or there’s a tube station is right next door and another line just down the street. Plenty of coffee shops right across the street to grab breakfast. Uber for the most part was very Pre-theatre dining - lovely atmosphere in the restaurant. The staff were polite, friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The menu had enough choice to cater for different dietary requirements and the food was delicious. We left well set up for our evening at the theatre. The hotel is perfectly located next to the Charing Cross station but we didn’t hear nor feel any train activity. The property was beautifully decorated both their permanent and holiday decor were equally tasteful. The staff was attuned to any request we may have had and were very responsive and attentive. We will definitely stay at the Clermont in the future. \"},\n",

It was the first time we have stayed at a travel lodge and the last.There is major building work being done,with out advising this,when booking.There was no breakfast or bar facilities.The room was cold,even when turned up to its highest level.we were here for two night,and room never got cleaned once,even the shower gel is watered  Good location but not a nice hotel, rude staff, not very clean.  Bedding not clean, window would shut properly. Constant cold air coming in through a vent under the window. Staff rude and not very helpful  Brilliant location, everything you could need, very clean and super friendly staff. This is the second time I've visited to see different shows nearby and its been perfect both times. Will absolutely visit again Easy check in at this very adequate, well priced hotel in the middle of the theatre district.  Room was clean and maintained adequately with supplies and clean towels.  Long set of stairs to get into lobby that necessitated hauling suitcases by hand.  Cafe and bar were closed so did not rate.  Lots of good, inexpensive breakfast locations across the street As the hotel stands I would not go back. I was led to believe this was an updated Travelodge, so thought I'd give it a try (usually use Premier Inn). Restaurant was closed & the hotel is in the middle of a & had not been told, and no information in the room regarding how to contact reception, etc, only menus which we couldn't use! Very basic, even for a budget hotel. I have stayed at this hotel before, and my experience was not as poor, however on this occasion we experienced a lot of noise from internal machinery (possibly the lift), which kept us awake all night. The room was small and did not have a phone to contact reception, or a hairdryer. It was super hot in the hotel, with the exception of the night. I would definitely try another hotel our next visit. Was not notified bar/restaurant would be closed.  Paid extra to have early check in. Room was not ready. Did not have the room I booked. Staff not concerned about all issues raised. Disabled hand rail was broken in the bathroom Amazing location🌟 This hotel is in the heart of London and everything is in walking distance. I stayed in one of the super rooms and it was so cozy, so warm with big ceilings. Really enjoyed my stay in here and the receptionist Parvinder was so sweet and helpful✨ Excellent hotel, excellent staff, clean rooms and a brilliant location at an affordable price. I would stay here again next time I visit London. Perfect location to all attractions the city has to offer. The 9th floor has an excellent view of the cities skyline.  After book well in advance we received an email 13 days prior to our visit saying they were unable to provide breakfast due to renovation being carried out   There was no offer of being able to cancel, just a refund for the breakfast that would be authorised after our visit. No bar or cafe so we were charged full amount for just a room  Staff were welcoming. There was a issue with food availability but we were advised when we booked in. Easy for us to walk to the theatre. Room was clean and tidy. Bed was clean and comfortable. It was quiet and  we had a good nights sleep. Hotel being renovated and breakfast facilities closed.  Paid for breakfast and this was cancelled two days before my stay. Travelodge refused to change booking as my booking was on a saver rate ( despite Travelodge changing the conditions I booked under).  Hotel was  cold, room heating not working. Room was tiny and hotel a building site. .  Got refunded for lack of breakfast but I would never have booked if I knew there was no facilities,  then not allowed to change to another hotel.  Never again. Whilst this hotel is undergoing refurbishment it still offers very good value for money. The room we had was clean, and had everything we needed. The staff were all friendly, helpful and professional. We could not have asked for more. The hotel was so close to so many amenities within walking distance, and this made it all a most pleasant few days. Thank you to everyone at this travel lodge, you are doing a brilliant job. Booked for one night but was disappointed with overall experience. Price was considerably high considering the service offered. Was looking forward to taking breakfast there, but upon arrival I was informed the breakfast is currently out of service. Would have been nice to have known this beforehand. Cold room and noise from both inside and outside the hotel. Was charged twice for the same booking, and had to chase up customer service to return the wrongly withdrawn funds. Ridiculous that there is no direct customer service line, you have to submit a complaint and wait for them to come back to you. Considering what they offer, Travelodge  should be charging a third of what they currently offer.  Uncomfortable bed, cold room, and dirty pillow cases. The hotel had bulding work inside and it was noisy. I guess it's a good location for Covent Garden, but it's a great place to stay. They dont offer breakfast, and the bathroom was so tiny but jad hot water. I dont understand why you would not provide a toilet brush in the hotel bathroom?  Stayed here for a birthday treat to London, we chose the hotel due to its location as it was best suited to our needs.  Have stayed in Travel Lodges before but this one was not ideal to say the least.  Building work was taking place, half of the hotel was not accessible through the main entrance. We were not told about this at the time of booking or even before our stay.  If this was explained we would have chosen another hotel, as we wanted to stay out late for various shows and booked events and sleep in.  However due to the building work and noise, this was not possible.   The room was dirty, the kettle, table top, TV remote and TV were covered in dust.   The aircon/heating did not work. The corridors were warmer than the hotel room. There was no toilet roll in the bathroom Great location and a great price for a room in central London. There are eateries close by or it’s just a five min walk to Covent Garden. Decor is basic but the bed was comfortable and it even had an iron in the room. I’d say it is better than your average Travelodge. Hotel is perfectly situated on Drury Lane for those wanting to visit the theatres or central London. Rooms are clean and reasonably sized. Unfortunately the bar and food facilities were unavailable due to rener actions - pity they didn't notify us of this when we booked only one week before our visit. Can highly recommend the White Hart pub just across the road from the hotel, super good, good selection of drinks and very helpful staff. We go there every time we stay at this hotel.  Sadly we were left disappointed, for London and the price paid I would expect a to stay in a clean room.  The bathroom smelt of urine, white towels were dirty and kettle not clean for use.  We were only staying for one night, and wanted to make the most of our stay visiting London so didn’t ask to change room, and waste time.  The bathroom smelt so bad I could not bring myself to brush my teeth when we returned from a show, nor shower properly the following morning.  It was manageable for one night. Had I stayed longer I would have complained.   Also the following morning we were trying to find the restaurant to be told the hotel was under refurbishment and therefore we could not have the breakfast we paid for as there was no restaurant (the gentleman sarcastically said as you Great location, very quiet n clean.  we stayed in a family room which was ideal. Found  the room a bit cold. But there was an electric heater in the room n once we put it on it was fine. Would definitely stay here again.  Our room was clean, quiet with amazing hot powerful shower. The staff were very friendly. This place is excellent value for money considering it’s in the centre of London. It didn’t matter that renovations were being done on the restaurant as there are plenty of amazing places to eat nearby. The top secret comedy venue is opposite - highly recommend! Struggled to get in through a security gate to the rear as the signage on how to get in was in an unlit area. Room was smelly and dirty and various lights/lamps not working. Paid for breakfasts before being informed there weren't any due to building works. Now have to wait up to 10 days for some reason to get the breakfast moneys refunded. Real shame as the location was good but will wait until refur is complete before I consider staying here again.  I booked this venue as part of a Xmas present on Xmas day for location and facilities only to be emailed the afternoon before to say the hotel was getting a refurbished bar and restaurant and therefore would be shut how unprofessional of a company of this size to do this when I complained they told me they didn’t know when the refurbishment would take place 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  Yes it’s central and probably as cheap as you’re going to get, but the place looks and feels like a prison. I turned the shower on and brown muck floated up out of the plug hole. Grim. Wouldn’t stay again.  Most of the staff was welcoming. Supervisor was miserable during the day. The bathroom that they gave smelled of a public toilet or sewage, though they did change the room when allerted. Biggest issue happened when our luggage was lost. Called to ask if they could check if it was there. Staff gave threats to put down the phone and were unhelpful until told we would have to call the police. Nice holiday ruined by poor customer service on the last day.  Good central location easy walk from underground station, location, clean rooms, helpfull and friendy staff. It was a shame the bar and dinning area was under refurbishment and we had to go out for a drink and breakfast.  Fantastic Stay Great location easy to get to tube fantastic area Good location for theatre Nice food places within a short distance just good for convenience Would recommend to other people Would definitely Stay again 😀  Spotlessly clean, recently refurbished room. Good value for prime position within easy walking distance of Covent Garden, Piccadilly, Leicester Square etc. Lovely food court at Seven Dials market two minutes from hotel. Would definitely use this hotel again!  It was ok, well-situated.  Staff or/and the policies not so friendly.  Check in on the 1st Jan, but the request for leaving 2 small backpacks on the 31st Dec. wasn’t accepted !   No water bottles provided, normally there are water bottles offered in all the hotels we’ve been to. So that’s a bit of a downer !  The Travelodge at Covent Garden benefits from a great location, comfy beds, reasonable prices and friendly and helpful staff. We stayed over New Years Eve and were in easy reach of the theatres, restaurants, viewing area and other attractions. We came to covent garden for new years weekend. When we arrived we were told that we would only have breakfast on New Year’s Eve and not New Year’s Day even though we paid for both days. Then on New Year’s Day they did do breakfast which we were told would not be on.   The hotel is not great for being in the centre of London we have stayed in Waterloo travel lodge which is 100% better than this one and better price.   Would not return to this travelodge again and would not recommend it. We arrived to what looked like a building site..we’d had no prior notification of building works.  The reception service was great, but we were advised that the breakfast we’d booked was not available, again with no email to let us know.  There were external walkways to get to our room, some fallen plaster on the carpet outside our room.  The room was ok, and the location of the hotel is great, so close to Covent Garden, Tube stations etc, but really feel customers should be made aware of the building works and lack of food service before arrival. First impressions not great as we walked into a noisy building site however the lady on reception was very friendly and although our room wasn't ready because we were early, she provided good customer service. Unfortunately the breakfasts we'd paid for in advance were not going to be available due to the refurbishment of the restaurant area.   The room and beds were smaller than we'd hoped and I can't say that we slept great. The corridor and stair case areas need maintenance and there was plaster falling off the wall outside our room. However the location was top notch and for this prime location you can be forgiving of the hotel! Just a couple of minutes from covent garden and the Cambridge theatre where we'd booked to see matilda. I just so wish that these budget hotels would Currently undergoing rénovations, which I understand but still full price , no breakfast or dinner options , noise outside , confusing walk ways , no warning before arrival . Was supposed to be family celebration we were very disappointed  We weren't told about renovations.  When checked in,one of the rooms was already occupied, so that had to be changed at reception. At 1045, my daughters card stopped her access to her room, so back to reception!   Booked for two nights over New Year. The check in process was easy, staff friendly and knowledgeable about the local area. 3rd floor room accessed by lift or stairs. Small room - and boy was it hot! Fortunately we’re able to turn the heating down. Comfy bed, kettle and tea/coffee making items present and refillable as required.  Bathroom is tiny - but functional.  Room spotlessly clean, the only reason I’ve given a 4 review not 5 is for the temperamental bathroom light and extractor fan. The hotel staff were friendly and it was realtively clean, but the bathroom door had no catch to shut it never mind lock the door and the window was very drafty and given the windy conditions it was incredibly noisy. Standard of accommodation perfectly adequate for our overnight stay. Excellent breakfast. There was a constant noise throughout the night from what sounded like a cistern filling but that was a minor irritation. The staff were outstanding in their customer care. Very friendly and family oriented hotel. Walking distance to everything (Holborn Station, downtown, and a lot of coffee shop).  There is also a BK shop crossed to the hotel name Cafe Verona, it's very friendly and great price.  \"},\n",

The location is great and transport links are good, and the rooms and amenities are good. Special thanks to Cesar from the bar who was very helpful. Reception staff have also been great. Overall thanks and I will definitely use Travelodge again! The hotel was in a great location from King\\'s Cross Station. The staff especially Bee was so kind and helpful! Helpful that they let us store luggage as we had a meeting to attend before our train home.  Continental breakfast options were good also. The room was nice and the bed comfortable (even though it was a Queen and not a King, as announced in the reservation)  Everyone was very nice and helpful Location is great with many buses and metro lines around  Bee was absolutely amazing on arrival and departure. She had such good energy and a Lovely smile! She is a great example of 5* service! Such a great location being so close to King’s Cross makes it somewhere I will definitely return to! Have had a lovely stay. Very centrally located, such a friendly team - Jyoti on reception gave me a lovely welcome. Room in great condition… a bit noisy but that goes with the location. I’ll be booking here again. We arrived early thinking check in was 2 o\\'clock but the lovely receptionist Bee explained if we took a seat she would see what she could do as we were very tired after a 14 hour flight .After 10 mins Bee explained that our room was ready if we didn\\'t mind a fire alarm drill at 2 o\\'clock we jumped at the chance and we had our room we couldn\\'t thank her enough excellent service with a smile.The room was perfect for our needs and would definitely stay again if only to see Bee,s smile 😁 Hotel is in a great location as it’s close to the tube station so easy access across London.  Bee at reception was great and very friendly! She was very helpful and nothing was too much trouble to sort out.   Only downside - the family rooms are situated on the noisy side of the hotel so there was quite a lot of noise outside. Aside from that, hotel is a great base to explore London. The hotel is in a great location and is good value for money.  The service was fantastic, especially Bee at the front of house who was lovely and friendly.  The only negative is the family rooms are located on the noisy side, so you will frequently hear the trains throughout the night. Overall would recommend. Comfortable Travelodge, really handy for King\\'s Cross. Easy for the West End too, especially by bike! Should consider making Internet access free, which is the case for most of the competition locally.  Despite the hotel being empty they tried to force me into the basement. After I complained they gave me a room more or less on top of the rail track. Rooms on the quieter side were available.  Loud music coming from dining room. No chance of sleep. The staff was awesome, very attentive.  Yes, it was an older building, and my room required quite a few doors to get there, but, that also meant that the windows faced inwards, so, outside noise was barely noticed.  My only issue was that the breakfast didn\\'t had that many options. In the hotel\\'s defense, they did warn it was a \"light, continental breakfast\" I\\'m just used to have some cheese & ham slices available, and I didn\\'t like the pancakes, but, the fresh croissants were quite good. As was the fresh fruit. Good location close to Kings Cross and St Pancras stations. Check booking details when you book. I’d thought I’d paid for early check-in and breakfast but that didn’t appear in the system when I arrived to check in … This is a perfect little Travel lodge just a 5 minute walk from Kings Cross station, decided to pay a little extra (only a little extra too) with a super room and worth every penny, rooms are located on the off the road side and during my 3 night stay was peaceful and so quiet .  Room size great and very comfortable and housekeeping received every day check in fab from Bee and nothing was a bit of bother for Abbie and Que. First time stay in a Travel lodge super room and pleasantly surprised - would certainly return - thanks again   I recently stayed at the Travelodge hotel in King\\'s Cross, and it was fantastic!   The  incredible staff were friendly and accommodating - shoutout to Andrew and Abby.    From check-in to check-out, everything was smooth and hassle-free. The staff was attentive and made sure all my needs were met. 💁\\u200d♂️💯  I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a comfortable stay with outstanding service. Enjoy your time there! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Andrew and Abby were wonderful and the stay was perfect.They looked after our luggage and took care of us. will stqy here at kings cross again because it is so close to the euro star bar and breakfast was good More character than the usual Travelodge in this converted police station and an excellent location next to King\\'s Cross and St Pancras. Abi on reception was very helpful and informative. Would definitely stay again clean and friendly interior - usual decent travelodge standards but very noisy air con outside window made it hard to get to sleep (had to use ear plugs) and poor sluggish wifi (which I had to pay for) The hotel is located in a good area close to the station and other places to go, the room was really nice, we had a comfortable stay. The staff were really friendly and helpful, with a special shout out to Bee and Foysal for going above and beyond :) The location of the hotel is fantastic, all of the staff were lovely, the room was what we needed, but when I got into the shower I found there was no shower gel in the dispenser, at this point I could not go down to the front desk without having to dry off, get dressed and shower again, so had a thoroughly disappointing shower, bad start to my day We prefered this hotel due to allowing pets however pet is not allowed in breakfast area. Had to enter the area separately with my partner as my dog can not stay alone. There was no hot food in breakfast even we paid extra.  If your room located near middle door, I suggest you to request change. Lots of door closure noise during night.  Otherwise, comfortable bed and enough big , warm room. straight forward stay, staff friendly and clean room, had issues with key card but reception was helpful and gave us new ones for the rest of the stay, really recommend staying here very close to train station and tubes, lots of shops open till late at night, quiet environment Very well positioned, lovely staff particularly helpful from Jyothi who changed our room reservation on check in, left bags before and after on the day, customer service absolutely amazing and couldn\\'t have asked for more. Our room overlooked the train tracks and was relatively quiet but you are literally at kings cross so a bit of noise is to be expected, personally we didn\\'t notice a thing. Would stay at again and probably will when visiting London overnight. Comfy bed, lovely nights sleep Staff very friendly including Bee on reception and staff member in breakfast cafe. Room clean and plenty of hot water . Bed comfortable. Good options for adjusting room temperature too. Great location in terms of access to transport. Breakfast offering was good - a wide selection including fruit, cereal, yogurts, pastries, toast etc Only downside for us and nothing hotel can do about it was noise from the trains. We are very light sleepers and live in a village so used to it being extremely quiet at night. If you are used to some noise at night it won\\'t be an issue. Finding anywhere quiet to sleep in central London isn\\'t easy! It was clean, quiet and very comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Very close to Kings Cross so was easy access to all the places we wanted to visit. Breakfast was good. Because of card locked doors it was safe and secure which was good for peace of mind. I stayed at this hotel with family members for one night which then became 2 nights when our scheduled train was cancelled. The staff were really helpful with our unexpected change. Our second night one of the rooms we booked had an extremely noisy neighbor and this was dealt with by the management. Would stay here again if I needed to be near King\\'s Cross. Good last minute booking, really accommodating. Arrived at 21:30 and was greeted pleasantly by reception staff. Room was clean and tidy, all facilities stated were available. Breakfast was lovely, received amazing service from Almaz. Staff are lovely, very friendly and helpful. Shout out to Almaz, beautiful lady as are all of the staff. It’s in a great location, easy to catch the trains or buses, we had an excellent stay. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting London. lt was a good experiences. Our room was clean and comfortable bed. Big thank you to Jyothi at the front desk was very very helpful and attentive. We willcome back here again next time when we visit London.  Sarin Great service, Front Desk including Bee were wonderful. Helped me out with everything I needed. New towels, free breakfast. Rooms were nice. Beds were comfortable. Perfect for a weekend traveling the city of London We stayed for 3 nights in January as a trip for our anniversary. The room was clean, quiet and all staff were friendly. We had pizzas on one of the nights on our stay and they were very nice. We would definitely recommend and would come and stay here again.  We had a great stay at the Travelodge. The room was comfy and the bar was fantastic. Really enjoyed the music and was served by lovely and welcoming staff Andrew and Nayeem. I’d really recommend staying here if you are looking for a hospitable and budget friendly location with easy access to the beautiful cities famous sights. Andrew and Nayeem were ‘top’. Very good for the price. Beds comfy, working tv and warm water couldn’t ask for much more for the price we paid. Would definitely come again and recommend to anyone coming soon. Staff very welcoming and helpful. Receptionist Bee very kind and thoughtful Andrew, manager also very welcoming Staff keen  to make my stay comfortable. Breakfast sufficient and variety good Room vomfortable Thank you Excellent location to Kings Cross station literally 5 minutes pushing suitcases. Abby from London Central Kings Cross Travelodge super helpful and allowed us to check into our room early as I wasn’t able to do it online. The ladies at the breakfast bar were also very friendly and gave our children a chocolate bar. Don’t be fooled by a 1 star rating it’s definitely a 3 star. It’s basic but clean and warm.👍🏻 Stayed in room 402 for 3 nights in Jan 2024. Room 402 has a window facing onto the back of the hotel and the train noise is constant and loud. The door between the lifts and the 4th floor corridor doesn’t have a soft-close piece fitted to it so it slams closed every time, and it appears most of the other hotel guests can’t keep their mouths shut either when returning back to their rooms after midnight.   If you are fond of being able to get, and stay, asleep then don’t book this hotel.   Also, the room had stains on the walls and on the ceiling.   Avoid. Fantastic service, we arrived early and Andrew and emly at front of house was amazing, he checked our bags in and we went for a trip round the pubs, we came back 1 hour later and Andtew had sorted us out and upgraded us, would  highly recommend this Hotel. 5 star service  Emily and Andrew were the best hostesses I’ve ever experienced. Full of kindness and understanding difficult situations. Me and my friends found ourselves in a predicament and despite admittedly not being the best guests they helped us without a problem. The place was a very good accommodation, we stayed as a group of 8 friends across 3 rooms and it was a very enjoyable experience overall. Service was excellent when solving a problem, and I would definitely consider staying here again next time I’m in London  The manager in the morning was amazing and very friendly and helpful name was Andrew.  . Highly reccomend Beds were comfortable. Would have liked cooked breakfast but not available Rooms comfortable. Staff really friendly. Very good location of travelling around London tourist beds are well made, service at reception is good and nice approachable staff(andrew)food is amazing however no cooked breakfast. security at all times so there is a good hotel in london. have a good time if you do visit '},\n",

We was given the wrong room on check in but Leah resolved this situation within minutes and she was very polite about everything. We had the most fantastic long weekend staying here. The decor is absolutely beautiful, very modern and well thought out in terms of accessibility. I didn’t encounter any problems with access, as a wheelchair user, the corridors were wide, there was so much SPACE and just lovely to explore. Although we didn’t use the gym downstairs, it was fitted out with everything you could possibly want or need.   We stayed in the Accessible studio apartment and it was stunning. I’ve never stayed anywhere that thought about design AND accessibility. It did not look like a hospital room (like many disabled access hotel rooms do), but instead like a show room.   There were emergency cords where needed, the bathroom was enormous with plenty of space to wheel about. It was kitted out with an Excellent stay, excellent value. It was difficult to telephone Wilde Aparthotel Aldgate.  You get put through always to StayCity and when I tried to contact multiple times around 8:00pm en route nobody answered the phone.  I would have given 5 stars but for this really annoying blip the night we arrived cold and soaking wet having got lost on the way. Great place for sleep, excellent decoration, a lot of place in the apartment with all the amenities for your stay, and take relaxing time for a new day of visiting the beautiful London. Really nice place a 9minutes walk of the underground aldgate east and 1 minute of the bus stop 15.  Beautiful rooms and facilities (ours had a stunning view!), good breakfast with some healthy options, quality snacks and drinks provided free of charge, friendly staff, gym on site, good transport links and the option to store luggage. We loved everything about our stay and are definitely going to be back. Wilde Aparthotels is a wonderful options for those looking into an affordable, convenient, and comfortable stay while visiting London. The staff was always available and very accommodating. The hotel itself was very clean, with facilities like a gym and laundry room offered. We enjoyed the 24/7 drink offerings as well. We will definitely book this establishment again on our next trip.  our stay at wilde was very good, the staff couldn’t have been more helpful. Would recommend to all friends and family and will definitely be back! The rooms were very clean and very close to metro stations etc great location! All was excellent! Good and friendly staff! The room has everything you need for cooking, even a dishwasher. Wonderful and not expensive place for stay in London! Not far from London City. I recommend.  The Room was really clean and the  facilities were nice. There is a gym. The rooms at the top have a lovely view . The Staff were friendly and helpful and the Beds were comfortable. Nearest train station about 10 min walk  I really loved the stay at the hotel. Free drinks and snacks were included and the staff was really friendly and helpful! The kitchen appliances were a plus since I was not expecting all of that. I can really recommend this hotel. I was very impressed with this hotel, room was clean & comfortable. Any request we had wasn\\'t an issue (needed an extra pillow, more tea bags & coffee pods). Loved the free drink & snack station, it was a welcome sight after being out all day. Breakfast was amazing! I\\'m sure we\\'ll be back. I\\'m delighted with the hotel room and the view. A comfortable and large bed with a view. You have a kitchen and everything you need to drink tea/coffee and eat (breakfast or dinner). The bathroom is beautiful, great shower and excellent LED light. It\\'s great that you have an iron and a hair dryer. The hotel workers are polite and will do anything to help you. All recommendations! Nice place, very close to Algate, Algate East and WhiteChapel Tube. There are a lot restaurant near the hotels, and some markets. The hotel is confrontable and the room was big enough for a family of three. Great view, super friendly staff and very comfortable. We would come back anytime. Rooms were clean and modern. Had a great time here at Wilde. Highly recommended. Price was fair as well and we loved the food package in the room  I found it lot better to stay than so many 4 star hotels I have stayed in last 7 years around in UK.  Room was decent sized with  everything one would need when on business trip. Comfy bed, water bottles in fridge.    Only dampener was hotel does not have fully staffed bar...  Friendly and helpfuld staff. Clean and modern hotel. Very Nice facilities and location… we liked it very much. Did not g’et the breakfast at hotel but it looked very Nice with many choices.. :) :) :) … Loved, loved, loved our stay. Super friendly staff. Customer service level is top notch in this particular Wilde property. Location is excellent. Aldgate East tube is 10 mins walk away and Whitechapel tube is approx 10 mins in other direction. Whitechapel is fantastic to get you directly to Heathrow no connections needed snd stops at all Heathrow terminals. There is a no. 15 bus opposite the hotel to take you all the way to Trafalgar Square and a stop at Tower of London also. Rooms are super modern clean, comfy beds fully equipped kitchen and fabulous toiletries by the Irish handmade soap company. Rooms are decent size for a London stay as rooms in this city are notoriously tiny. Breakfast offering was excellent. No hot breakfast except for boiled eggs. Full, bottomless  This place is definitely a gem of a find and we will definately stay here whenever we come to London. Can’t fault anything . 6 min walk to the station it’s so convenient. Staff are so helpful and friendly they can’t do enough for you. The room is so well equipped with small kitchen including nespresso Kettle Toaster Fridge Dishwasher Microwave Small hob. There is even complimentary snacks and a qr code to contact reception via what’s app for anything you need. I highly recommend and they have several locations in London. Well done Wilde Aparthotel you’ve definitely got it right  x First, it was a very clean room.  No sink in bathroom and no washcloths.  Cramped room for two people with luggage.  Platform bed that was not fun climbing in and out.  There were no blackout curtains so light from the street was bright.  Reported all this to management and was told that future buildings will have sinks in bathroom and regular standing beds.  That’s nice for future customers but my experience was not good. Great size rooms and big comfy beds. Very clean. Great free tea and coffee facilities. Great kitchenette. Lovely powerful hot showers. Very easy check in and check out. Everything is new. Staff are very accommodating.  Very comfortable bed with great facilities and in room mod cons. Kitchen area was perfect size for requirements and had all the necessary dishes & cutlery. Lovely table and comfortable sofa bed / chair to sit on - studio room was nice & spacious making good use of the space. The staff cannot be faulty they were excellent and went over and above it just was t a great location for us but just a short walk from Aldgate East station. I didn’t use any of the facilities but the room was well equipped just needed to work out the temperature it was very warm. Great value for your money! The beds are very comfortable and the service is outstanding. The hotel is located in a nice area with plenty of great food spots for breakfast, brunch, lunch or even dinner. The public transportation is near the hotel. The hotel staff gave us all the information needed to explore the city and get most out of our stay. The most important thing for us is the cleanness and hygiene in the hotel and the rooms, that was perfect as well! The staff is very hospitable.  This was our first stop in the UK after a long haul flight from downunder. We timed our arrival for mid afternoon which gave us time to get our bearings and stock up for self catering.   Staff were very friendly and helpful and although we had checked in online before arriving we still found ourselves regurgitating the same information again above the music so I\\'m not sure we saved any time.   The facility is very new so everything feels fresh about the place. Its very clean too. Breakfast is served in the lobby everyday but we were self catering so can\\'t comment on this. We did love the complimentary cookies and cake that were available to all guests during the day - a nice touch having something to have with a hot drink after being out exploring.   This hotel is close to The place was great really great, clean etc but blimey the pillows were super uncomfortable which caused difficulty getting to sleep. They are not firm at all so neck support provided, even if you stack them up. But the rest was really good!!  The room did cost just under 250 for one night which was very expensive for 1 night in comparison to similar accommodation.    First time in London,it was a surprise for me how easily it was with transportation, I loved st.james park with the squirrels and how clean city it was.Also the respect in the environment and the huges pavements. We stayed in 2 rooms, a double for my wife and me, then a triple when our daughter joined us. Both were spotless, beautifully compact and both had spectacular  views, the second room of the skyline of the skyscrapers of the City of London. The staff were constantly friendly and helpful, we were warmly looked after by Julia and Suonny, who were always ready to help, and gave us tea, nespresso coffee capsules, snacks and stylishly tiny bottles of milk (the hotel provides all of these free of charge). The location was great, close to Aldgate East tube, and a 15 minute walk to Whitechapel and the superfast Elizabeth Line. It\\'s a great area, with Brick Lane and trendy Spitalfields Market close by, and we had a very good dinner in the Punjabi restaurant close to the hotel, Tayyabs. It was a very nice place to stay. There is a grocery store nearby and multiple underground stations in the area. There are also a lot of nice things to do in the area itself. We went to the Monet Immersive Experience on the first day and it was a 15 minute walk from the hotel. There are a lot of options on Uber Eats to choose from. And our favourite restaurant was a 5 minute walk from here. The room was very clean and big. There is also a gym available. And there was an option for us to check in early! So that was very nice too! Whilst checking in on Tuesday afternoon, around 1730 ish, i was greeted by a very friendly team as soon as i arrived, my room was upgraded during the process which i was very greatful for. I have been staying in hotels weekly for just over a year now and this is the first time ive been upgraded. I was given an apartment which was very comfortable and spacious, with an exceptional view. Sorry i didnt get the name of the lady, but she was brilliant. Very friendly and chatty. I also liked the informal check-in \"desk\". The breakfast was a simple continental breakfast, but was ideal for a quick bite before heading to the office. 100% will book again the next time im in london.  A great experience dealing with staff. I booked a hotel for my family (4 adults and two children).   Unfortunately, I became very ill  about ten days before our trip and was admitted to the hospital with a life-threatening issue.    I notified the hotel and my payment was refunded within a few days.  If I recover, you can be sure that I would book our stay with this hotel.      This hotel has it all, on one of the best bus routes in London it gives easy access to the tourist spots. Local area great for good value food etc. All round perfect place to stay. Would definitely stay again. Incredible stay from check in /check out special thankyou to Julia, Ahmed and Luis for your 5* service. Room 1303 was spacious, immaculately presented and has the most amazing views over the city (shard - gherkin etc) highly recommend and look forward to returning soon- super job all. We had a great stay in a one bedroom apartment. 2 adults, 2 children. Apartment was very clean and comfortable and had all we needed to hand. Sofa converted to 2 singles which the kids reported to be very comfortable and the bedroom had a large, very comfortable bed. TV in both rooms which was great for chilling after a busy day exploring.  Bathroom and shower were great, strong shower (overhead or hand held option) and plenty of hot water always.  Small table and chairs which was fine. Nice big window in living area with electric black out blinds. The kitchen had all we needed too and was very convenient to have a fridge, kettle etc to save on eating out all the time. The hotel does offer breakfast which seemed to be popular but we didn\\'t try it. Common areas in the hotel were Perfect attention and the room have everything I need. Hotel in the area I needed for my work purposes. Fitness room small but complete. The attention of the manager and employees great. Sure for business I repeat without any doubt. The room was spacious and clean, very nice modern design. The staff were helpful and answered our questions very quickly. The only issue was the dishwasher was loud, otherwise we well enjoyed our stay.  Excellent location with great transport links. Rooms quite spacious with everything you would need for either short or long term stays. All staff encountered were very friendly and always ensured everyone is greeted. Floor we were staying on had an issue with A/C which meant the room was very warm but didn\\'t affect us to much as we spent most of the time in the city. The manager on duty was able to fix it the first night but never worked again. Highly recommend this property and will definitely use again. we had a great stay, overall very good, not far from subway, very friendly staff, small but convenient rooms, clean and quiet. We were in the top floor, fast elevator!  We will book with staycity again!  The hotel is located in the city centre which contributes to the great accessibility of all sort of transportation. The hotel staffs are kind and attentive to all your demands, the service is at a high quality in all aspects. Amazing hotel and great service from friendly and professional staff. Great location and had everything we needed and more for our two night stay. I highly recommend staying at the Wilde Hotel in Tower Bridge, Aldgate, London.   We have just come back from this fabulous hotel , where we experienced some of the best customer service , From the moment we arrived until today they could not have made us more welcome . The manager even took time to have a chat with us and made us a cup of coffee to send us on our way . Would definitely recommend staying there , we will return. Thank you all again , keep up the hard work it is what a holiday should be remembered for . '},\n",

Patricular highlight was Safae  who was an excellent hostess, who was very attentive to our requirements. Would book on again just based on her friendliness and attitude. Room is perfect for a trip. Service in the hotel was amazing and Safae provided great and quick services and very friendly. She was very attentive and ensured we were happy and had everything we needed. Thank you Safae. Would stay again! We have checked into this travelodge for work as going to an exhibition in the excel reserving 3 rooms the very nice staff arranged for all the rooms to be together the wonderful staff are Deanne Safae and Maria. They even said about getting gluten free bread for one of us as she is gluten intolerant. Once again wonderful staff Everything was amazing, staff was polite, helpful and always went out of their way to help you. The room was lovely, roomy and clean. Beds were comfy and the food was absolutely amazing. Couldn't of wished for a better stay!  Checked in for a convention over the weekend. Staff are always lovely, specifically Safae, who allowed us to stay in the same hotel room despite us booking a different type of room for the second night we were there. This made the experience so seamless and easy, we were very grateful. Room was clean, as it always is when we stay in this hotel. Would absolutely stay again, even just for the helpful staff. I’ve stayed in a lot of Travelodge hotels over the years. Some good, some bad and some in between. This is the best of them all. Warm and comfortable room, reasonably priced but good food, very friendly staff especially Abi at the front desk (and bar). Recommend to all I had a good stay here the staff was amazing, The lad who worked over night was out standing i belive his name was Samuel he went out of his way to make sure we had a good stay. Didn't spend too much time in the hotel as a friend wasn't very well and had to go hospital but he made sure everything was sorted back at the hotel. As a 19 year old too he did a very good job hats off to him he could have went out with his mates but worked instead  i booked this a week before NYE and was still pretty cheap   I prob wouldn't come back to his hotel as everything that went on at A&E would just bring back the memories of it all Okay for 2-3 nights. Bathrooms should be cleaned daily even if towels are cleaned every 6 days. extra beds were very narrow. One turn and you risk falling from the bed during the night.  Otherwise the stay was fine. bed was comfortable. and walls and doors are thick. not a lot of noise except for the airplanes.   Breakfast is very basic and seemed expensive. and did not like 2 device limit on the wifi which we bought separately.  Decent place with great staff, Roy comes to mind as being very helpful, friendly & attentive..Good man! Not a bad place for a Travelodge & well situated for all matters Excel related. Needing to leave a 200 character review is a bit much tho, lol. Excellent customer service staff are very friendly I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone CJ on reception was an excellent help. Food and drinks very nice. Rooms very modern,clean,warm and comfy  Friendly staff, nice food.  The breakfast was nice, only comment is the bacon was under cooked.  I would stay there again.  Very good value for money. The room was clean.  Easy tube ride to Stratford.  Highly recommended   Anna at the reception was quite helpful and polite.  I will surely recommend Travelodge to my friends Food was excellent, rooms were clean and tidy.  Courteous staff.    Great location   Thanks  Leo Customer service was excellent, the beautiful lady Maria was so polite and helpful! The place was also clean and the reception was tidy got offered breakfast which was great but decided to choose later, thank you for the brilliant service Maria! Deanne was very helpful, kind would recommend to anyone in the area. The hotel was nice and clean. And staff was very friendly, book if your in the local area. Id highly recommend you to stay the night here. We stayed for 2 nights and had found several bed bugs in our bed, not small ones either. Several were crawling as we were asleep. Also lots of noise within the hotel with guests loitering in the hallway. Cheap stay, rooms and bathroom are ok and clean (had rooms on 4th floor). A bit noise from the train and airport nearby. Staff is serviceminded and friendly. They have glutenfree beer in the bar, and some glutenfree alternatives for breakfast and dinner.  There was no bed sheets on our bed, we was told they will bring us some shortly but we didn't get any in the end.  Staff were all knew and no one really knew what was going on  it took 15mins to make a 3 cocktail We (2adults, 2kids) were asked to change rooms on our first night because they mistakenly brought us to the wrong one, even when we were already settled and our things are already there and it was the same room but on a different floor. When asked why are we moving they couldnt give us a clear answer as to what happened.  Room service did not come when we asked for top up in our room when we left in the morning and came back at night, they did not give us top up, we had to go down to reception to get towels which is a hassle.   The toilet was clogged and there was no maintenance available to fix it when we reported it on our first night and still, nobody came the following morning to fix it.   I think there is poor communication and handing over between staff during change of Our stay was perfect. The food was nice and the rooms were clean. Sleeping was quite easy as well considering the beds were comfortable and it wasnt cold at all during the night. Definitely one of the best hotels I've been to. Parking could have been cheaper and public transport is 10 to 15 mins away. Stay was good for family with extra beds for kids  Calm surroundings and neat cafe for access also available. Reception available 24x7 as well I wish there was an option on booking. When I checked in and went into my room there was a double bed and two single bed which I didn’t need in the room.  It was me and one year old staying in the travel lodge. I needed a travel cot and space for him to crawl and walk around. The issue was kinda resolved by putting one of the single beds on top of each other to have some room for the baby and travel cot.  I did call the hotel to request a travel cot but I was told to do it when I actually check in. Definitely need to have a option asking customers if they need a extra bed or a travel cot on arrival. Overall nice location near the DLR, nice staff, great breakfast and great hospitality  Good value, friendly reception team. Short distance to DLR, 2 stops to main Excel entrance. Very close to London City Airport too. Clean room, reasonably quiet considering location. Little around the area. We arrived and my youngest sons bedding was dirty, took over an hour to get clean bedding delivered and 2 trips to the reception. The staff were grumpy and less than helpful. There was no loo roll so another visit to reception.  I would just like to add, to my previous review and experience that was a very bad one, how ironic that suddenly thereafter,  there are glowing reviews about the staff and management, particularly about Deanne, she was the problem, she was rude, arrogant and damn right unprofessional…  Sad how friends of friends, staff of staff had to come a rescue this - stay clear of this Travel Lodge because of the Staff!!! Abi batu ,shaheda , Deanne has given me the best customer service possible please relay this and tell them my gratitude I just met them and they were extremely helpful. Please hire more staff like them they have great customer service Very good stay. Nora, Maria and Deanne-Monique are some of the best members on the Team. Thank you, Deanne-Monique for swiftly rectifying a minor issue faced. Happy New Year to the ExCel branch. A good team. Staff and service have been excellent, I extended my stay. The rooms are very comfortable. The bar and cafe are very reasonable for this part of London. The hotel is conveniently located for access to the City Airport and all major parts of central London. Very good. This hotel is one of the most amazing travelodge experience that I have had. The care and welcoming is outstanding and they make sure that their guests are well made to feel special. Wahida is amazing. I recommend this hotel because of her. Excellent service. Deanne and CJ was very friendly and they helped me out a lot. The room was tidy and accommodating for my short stay. Would definitely come again and recommend to all my friends and family. Very diligent and attentive even when it was very late at night. A credit to your organisation and I can only hope the management appreciate her customer service commitment. She even explained that she was not allowed to be tipped, so perhaps look into this for your staff. Anna & Maria were amazing. Both very helpful with information on places to go. Service was great and couldn’t recommend enough. Stay was awesome.   Room were spotless and view was lovely in the morning. Very happy with my stay. receptionist made us feel like we had inconvenienced her day, totally unwelcoming and unhelpful, room was on the ground floor close to reception and was extremely noisy all night, didn't get a winks sleep On our weekend away we witnessed rodents running along the side of the breakfast area, it dropped down the cable hole into the cupboards to which I opened after photographing it and was shocked to see rat poo everywhere with the breakfast cereal, after showing the reception staff my photos expecting it to be sorted in the morning alas no poo still in the cupboards the following day apparently a specialist team has to come and deal with it, couldn’t get refund on our room or breakfast we had pre paid for, little warning for you guys thinking of going there Deanne gave me amazing service! Highly recommend. So bubbly and welcoming. Giant car park!, 24 hour bar. If you get hungry there’s a 24 hours menu which is handy. Pizzas too! Cocktails tasty too. Best travelodge!!  The lady was nice 24 hour bar room was clean and lovley very polite fairplay 5 star for me very nice and friendly there felt so welcome comeing in. Nice and big carpark around the back of this hotel very happy with my visit  Great service. Outstanding staff Samual and Deanne were great. 247 bar and pizzas. Great team huge car park. Great selection on the bar. Great Christmas vibe too. Huge car park with lots of spaces. Very clean and tidy room  i had an amazing stay. deanne was very helpful and was very kind and respectful. has a nice and tidy reception big massive bar huge car park deanne was super helpful will defo be coming back pizzas were great too  Diane was amazing the facilities where also good car park was large had no trouble finding  parking and vending machine had a large amount of options. Was met by a friendly face who helped us pick a room that met out needs  The lady named Deanne was really lovely and allowed us to use the facilities even though we weren’t staying there. The facilities were very clean and tidy, and all staff seemed very friendly. Great customer service! the walk from the Excel to the hotel was dreadful, under a bypass, past old mattresses and pushchairs. the hotel downstairs was clean but the room was smelly and the bathroom unclean. the staff did not give a damn\"},\n",

The hotel double charged me and wouldn’t give me my money back. I have contacted them 6 times to ask for them to correct their mistake but they still haven’t returned my money. They have admitted their error but tell me it is up to me to contact my bank to get my money back. Unbelievably poor customer service. The experience was great ,definitely a 5star . Monalisa made check -in easy , she upgraded my room with a certain discount and gave us a room with a view of beautiful LONDON EYE...the tour of the hotel was also really great.....Will come.back for my anniversary which is in May .. the staff  was extremely helpful. Another great stay at this hotel. Lovely room overlooking the garden and river. Lovely welcome from desk and bottle of fizz for my birthday was a fabulous surprise- thank you very much ❤️ We’ve stayed here before and love returning. The location is perfect. We stayed for 2 night, it’s a stunning building in a wonderful position right on the Thames opposite the London eye. Our room was beautifully appointed, but, we were very disappointed that our window over looked an internal staircase and the windows didn’t open, so no natural light and no air. At night the room was quite bright because there was a bright light on the stairs. Luckily the bed was huge and very comfy. Breakfast was delicious and a special mention to the staff in the restaurant who were excellent.  I would stay here again but would be more selective about the room I choose. We went for champagne afternoon tea on the 08.01.2024 and the atmosphere  there was amazing but the service we received  was superb from Olena from F&B she has got a very good sense of humour and customer service. Kind Regard  Rose M The Royal Horseguards was not the 5 star experience I was expecting. My wife and I were celebrating our 40th  anniversary and I thought this would be an experience to remember. I was unfortunately wrong. We were given room 511 which , although quite large, had very little else going for it. The room was an internal room with a half glazed widow to an area  that house air conditioning ducting. The noise was quite loud and made it difficult to sleep. After a complaint we were allocated room 420 , a much nicer and quieter room. In this room there was a loose tile in the bathroom , no underfloor heating and heated towel rail was not working. This was reported to reception but nothing was addressed. Breakfast was ok but a lot of people fighting over the use of two old toasters is not Huge rooms, great location and good value midweek.  I would have given 5 stars all round but (a) the room was very cold when we arrived and the aircon takes many hours to warm it up, (b) the lighting system is unnecessarily complicated and (c) the bar was closed. We could order drinks to have in the lobby but that's not the same as a hotel bar! Today we had a great afternoon tea   At around 2.30pm  3 of us Tania was great  my parents was celebrating there 50th wedding anniversary anniversary the afternoon tea was amazing great sandwich’s great tea we had and lovely wine  the food was excellent and recommend My mom and I had the most splendid time at the Royal Horseguards. Gonsala and Ozoda were professional and welcoming, with careful attention to our bottomless brunch. Tasty food and cosy atmosphere. Recommend! Very friendly and helpful staff. The footmen guys were really kind and helpful, even walking our bags to the embarkment tube platform when we left. Cant say enough about them. Breakfast was really delicious. Looked forward to that everyday.  Went for a bottomless brunch to celebrate a friend’s birthday. The service was excellent, so was the food. Everyone was nice and accommodating. Special thanks to Gonzalo, Goury and Bristi. We really had a lovely time. Had lunch and tea with my friend for my birthday. The waiters made a fuss of me and even insisted on singing happy birthday which was a really lovely touch.  Whilst I was initially disappointed that there were no sandwiches in the lunch menu the crispy prawn and vegetable spring rolls were delicious. A big thank you to Gonsalo and the team for making it so special. What a lovely atmosphere and touch created. Many many thanks. All best for 2024 The hotel room exceeded my expectations.  It was a single room and more than fulfilled my expectations and needs. I have stayed in royal horse guards prior to Covid and hope to return more in the future. The hotel is placed wonderfully for the galleries and parks. Book it. You won’t be disappointed.   We had such a nice time at the afternoon tea. Special thanks to Olena who was such a great and helpful person. We celebrated my wife birthday, and food and tea was amazing. Will come back soon.  Regards from México. We booked our trip to London through a traveling agency. It was our very first time in London. We stayed for 8 nights and even celebrated NYE in this beautiful city.  The hotel looked old (not in a bad way), historic, and very elegant. Our room was clean and surprisingly big for a double bedroom. We had enough space for our stuff and a very comfortable big bed. The minibar was filled daily without any extra costs (very big plus point). Although our room did not have a river view and we just looked at a wall, we were very happy with the room because the location of the hotel is THE BEST!   We were only in our hotel for breakfast and sleeping etc. This city offers so much! Thanks to the PERFECT location, we were able to see a lot of the city. The train station/underground is only I visited this wonderful Resort and i loved but specially after  I met the Cuban Manager Eliaz I think this is his name , we were really impressed with his customer service skills, he made us feel very welcome, we will for sure return,persons like him IS what hotels need,thank you. The hotel only seemed to cater for the new year black tie event. Other guests seemed irrelevant and unable to access terrace to view fireworks although we went out to the embankment and viewed . We actually paid for the hotel just to access the section out the front of the hotel, it was worth it though. Breakfast excellent. This hotel is within five min walk to restaurants, pubs and a tube station. Rooms were well stocked with coffees / tea and comforts of home. Buffet style breakfast had everything and more you would want and more. Staff was very attentive and friendly, going above and beyond to make our experience great. Gonsalo was great at explaining / recommending things to do and provide some local content while we were there. Lovely location in what could be an amazing hotel full of history and culture. However it really needs a make over, while communal spaces are ok, rooms are really dated and ours wasn’t very clean. Woodwork is scratched and stained and chairs gave the impression of an old people’s home. Beds were clean and very comfortable. We stayed in a river view room but no access the the balcony, windows were locked. Saying all this staff were friendly and as long as you get it for a good price the location nearly makes up for it. Could be a gem with a bit of TLC  The Royal Horseguards is an excellent hotel. It's a luxury hotel that feels like home. The service was top-notch, the holiday decorations were beautiful and the room was spacious and very clean. I wish I knew about it sooner. It is only a 2 minute walk from the Embankment tube station and the London Eye, Big Ben, Parliament and Westminster Abbey are all in walking distance. Whenever I visit London this is were I will stay from now on.  We spent our New Year’s Eve in London and stayed at the  Royal Horseguards Hotel for three nights. It was a great experience. The rooms are clean and the beds are very comfortable. The best part, however, was the hotel staff. Everyone was very friendly and helpful, and they were always willing to assist with any questions or concerns. I’d like to give a special shout out to the restaurant staff, especially Mohammad. He was Exceptional! Will recommend to our American friends for their next trip to the city. We booked the New Years Eve dinner and a three night stay from 12/31/23 through 1/3/24.  The room was dingy, recliner chairs would not come upright, shower was not clean (hair from previous guest on the walls) and we were given just 2 towels and 2 washcloths.  The 450 pound per person dinner was not as pictured on the website.  We were in a dining room that felt like a basement/office storage.  The hotel info said to dress appropriately, which we did, but felt completely overdressed considering the room where we were sitting (as did the others guests at the tables next to us).  We stayed in a river view room in order to see the fireworks which was the only good thing I can say about this hotel.  We checked out early the morning of 1/1 and received a refund for the room charge Lovely lunch time meal. We were the first in for lunch at 12pm so it was quiet but the staff were attentive and the food was served in a reasonable time. Price was acceptable for what was a very tasty meal. Thank you to our server, Bristi.  Thank you for all the service! We have good time there. Many thanks to breakfast service team, especially Gonsalo, Darshini, Bristi and Vinod! It is the best beginning for our day trip in London every day.  This hotel is in the best location, in the walking distance to all all main attractions. Very good service, very friendly staff, great food, direct view to London eye from our room and we watch the show from our room. We tried to make reservation to Rules for days and failed, our concierge in hotel was able to book it for us for dinner . Unbelievable! Next time in London I will stay in  this hotel for sure.  Was looking forward to our stay after booking and payment was taken twice taking 2 weeks to get back  Then on arrival room smelt bad of sewage was moved to lot smaller room and down graded to what we paid.  Absolutely amazing hotel in the very center on London. Just next to metro and everything else with a walking distance. Big, clean, nice rooms. The best, helpful and professional staff. Most probably the best hotel in Europe we have been. A comfortable hotel in a great location. Nevertheless year end period can be overcrowded resulting in a poorer service quality. The breakfast doesn’t offer enough food choices and the room is too limited for the number of clients. We went to One Whitehall Place for New Year’s Eve 9 years ago and returned with a group of friends. It was an even better evening. We were warmly welcomed and enjoyed the reception and the dinner was also really good. We watched the fireworks, this must be one of the best views in london and then danced until the early hours. The staff were brilliant, friendly and helpful. Thanks to all the team for a memorable start to the new year. Stayed here in July and was great. Central to everything easy walk to most attractions. Room was large good vibe. All staff very attentive to our needs. Only downfall high tea was a let down. Cakes stale We chose to stay at the Royal Horseguards because of its proximity to the NYE fireworks. It’s a great location and overall a nice hotel. It’s expensive though and the property is quite poorly maintained and managed. Our king room was nice and spacious but the carpets were very sad and worn. The shower in the bathroom was pretty sad with moldy caulk a plenty in the shower pan. Sad for the premium this location demands. Sadder yet though was opening the shower door after my shower to find the bathroom floor almost completely flooded. Management could only offer me a lesser room or a next day maintenance visit. Pathetic. Gorgeous hotel, service was impeccable. Made us feel welcome from the very first open door. This location cannot be beat! Along the river with views of the park. Short walk to the Tube- the best way to get around London!  Breakfast was amazing and relaxing. Our first morning we had a tour and needed to be at our meeting spot at 7:30a. Front desk staff arranged for breakfast and coffee to-go and had it waiting for us. They also booked our taxi so we wouldn’t miss our tour. Spent Christmas Eve and Day. They sent a lovely box of treats to each of our 3 rooms. Our bags were kept no problem and brought to our room. The room with a king bed was the best. Other double rooms were small but still lovely. In one room the TV speaker was in the bathroom a little weird but we didn’t come to Poor initial service - didn’t acknowledge anniversary or provide correct room. Location though was excellent near main sights. Breakfast was great though they tried to charge us again for this despite the booking including breakfast. Overall make sure you have written evidence when arriving  Hotel is lovely.  The highlight is the service.  Gonzalo snd his team in the restaurant and the best in London!  Absolutely perfect.  We will visit again because of Gonzolo and his team.  We have been so pampered and had delicious meals with impeccable service.  All hotels should have staff like this.  We will be back! Very nice hotel but more room information about the facilities needed on arrival, for example, the location of the kettle and cups. The wash basin plug was broken - no big issue so we notified reception on our departure! Very comfortable bed and a great full English breakfast! The hotel is wonderful, steeped in history and luxurious. The rooms are spacious and the bed are very comfortable. Good quality linen and towels.  The restaurant is excellent.  Great breakfast. High tea was delicious and very authentic. Meals are perfectly prepared.  The service was excellent as well. Very attentive team and very thoughtful.  They have a wonderful tour of the building-notably MI-6 was founded, the beginnings of Scotland Yard and where Winston Churchill had an office during the war.  This is my 3rd stay and will continue to return.  The location is spectacular and architecture is breathtaking!  To me this is 5 star hotel ! Went to spend two nights and got a lovely riverview  room , every thing is nearby . Monalisa, gave detailed introduction about the hotel history which is truly amazing to know. Whole staff was friendly . Would like to come back soon in summers for holidays.  We were amazed by this hotel! Not only was it beautifully decorated for Xmas, we had a free upgrade to a river view with complimentary mini bar! Raoul was so friendly and was chatting to us about what we had planned whilst checking us in. He was so lovely and polite. The room was spotless and there was nothing we could fault!  A really good hotel in a great location. Easy access to tube, easy to walk to a lot of the sights, great staff and a very enjoyable and relaxing stay. Breakfast choice was outstanding. The room and it's technology was in need of updating but overall a very good hotel to stay in. Beautiful hotel in a lovely central London venue. The waiter was amazing was so attentive to our needs, friendly and engaging with us. The mood set in the restaurant was perfect for a evening meal.   We had a 3 course meal and it was absolutely fantastic. Every dish came out to perfection and I can not fault anything about the restaurant.   They even bought out a personalised cake as we were celebrating a birthday.   Thank you so much! You made the day so special and it is clear, each and every member of staff take pride in their work. \"},\n",

I then went into the second room and AGAIN as disgusting but this time the room They have some of the best views in London! The staff is super helpful too. You will feel right at home here. A phenomenal experience for tourists as the stay is just perfect. Special shoutout to Gini, Gautam and Sathesh from the reception as they were helpful during my checkin process and stay. Keep it up! I recently stayed at the Tower Hotel. While walking in, I was impressed with the lobby and entrance. I was excited to see my room. As I opened my room door, I was not impressed. I was staying in a Family Room.  It consisted of a small bedroom that opened up to another small room with a fold out couch.  It was small!  The room was very outdated!  Very!  The bathroom is what made me want to leave before my check out date.  There was mold in the shower along the base of the very tall tub ( older people would have difficulty getting in and out of) and up the wall.  The toilet did not flush properly.  We had to continuous push the handle to get enough water in the toilet to go down.  The bank of the bathroom door was filthy.  And many times the bathroom smelled like sewage. Something Would be a 4.9 if I could give it. Great location, helpful staff, comfy bed. Staff went above and beyond to help me celebrate my birthday with a cheesecake and bottle of wine left in the room. View of the bridge and Shard was second to none. Only complaint was that the bathroom was dated. Mould in the sealant, and old fixtures. Carpets coming up both in the room and on the hotel stairs. Brilliant location.  However, on arrival the Receptionist “offered” us an upgrade and told us he was going to look after us .. as if it was a free upgrade - was offered a view of the tower bridge for an extra $60 plus a night  - we declined his “generous” offer as the bridge is viewable from front door !.  Our room had nice view anyway.  Very expensive for what we received. We paid for the tower view and we were not disappointed.  The staff were extremely  friendly and the room itself was spotless. Montseuat who checked me in was so friendly  and polite and was made to feel so welcome A Job Well Done!   My review is more focusing on the wonderful talents of two staff,   Montseurat (Reception) and apologies if spelt incorrectly.   A wonderful check in experience and remembering my return to the hotel was a lovely touch, Joyful smiles lots of engaging conversation, Plenty of questions and offerings of tips or advice on what to do whilst in London. Even allowing me to try out a little Spanish conversation once she found out I was learning the language was a wonderful touch to the whole experience.   Montseurat truly captures the important aspects of guest service being a wonderful first point of contact for the hotel, A true ambassador and wonderful member of staff who needs congratulating from management.   Lastly a shout out for Soumaya Guest Relations (again Montserrat on reception is the most polite, helpful lady I've ever met, she is super professional, great experience at check in, she is a great credit to the Tower Hotel, If you have an employee recognition scheme, you must reward this outstanding member of staff (no I'm not related to her and hadn't met her until yesterday) Found the location and the views amazing but the hotel is dated and in need of updating. Service at reception was brilliant, lady I think called Allegra(?). Very small double room. The TV in our room, although very large, had a black line through the middle. No tea or coffee available with the kettle, just sugar!  Bathroom was probably the biggest let down. Smelt musty as soon as you walked in. Black mould around the bath. Shower didn’t keep a constant temperature. Traveling solo ahead of my tour was a bit stressful. So when I arrived at The Tower I was greeted by a very pleasant young man, Sathesh. He got me checked into my room early and made sure I was in the same room my whole stay. ( I was scheduled to change rooms when my tour started). Smiling through the whole process. I stayed at The Tower for over a week and felt very comfortable and had no issues. It’s really a great location, easy transit access, restaurants and attractions. The most amazing views of Tower Bridge!   Lovely comfortable hotel and  lovely accommodating staff.  I had a little issue with the shower in the bathroom which I've reported to reception, so I'm sure it will  be sorted for the next guest (I only stayed for one night).  If I had to find a fault it maybe that the bathroom needs a little refreshing, but perfectly serviceable, and the hotel decor in the communal areas looks a little tired.   The location is brilliant with the tube nearby and  the Tower of London a stones throw away. It was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at, and i’ve stayed in MOTELS in down town Miami. The first thing i noticed was how cold the room was. It was snowing outside and my room was absolutely freezing. The heater did not work and the air-con was blowing in more cold air. This issue did not get fixed. Their guest phone was broken also.  When I went to take a shower there was chunks of blonde human hair stuck to the walls of the shower. Grime also.  Rooms are tiny, cold, and decorated with fluid stained carpets.   Horrible experience. I should have just camped on the bridge instead. We would like to thank the The Tower Hotel for the service and for made our stay in  London a relaxed holiday to remember. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.   The views from Hotel are amazing the service and the breakfast were excellent, the room very spacious comfy and tidy.   Good restaurants and cafeterias near the Hotel.   The tower Bridge and the tower castle are opposite and next to the hotel .  Wished I stayed longer then 3 nights. The staff was very responsive to any and all needs that needed to be met, and the location was great. The room was cleaned daily, and the room service was quickly brought up whenever it was requested. Would definitely recommend this stay for any families, couples or any visitors as it's in great location in regard to known tourist attractions.  The Tower hotel is located on thr banks of the thamas , with views of the Tower Bridge  The staff were helpful and worked hard to keep everyone happy in thus large hotel  Amazing views of the tower bridge in sone rooms and the XI bar which is the hotel bar  The breakfast room have lovely views of St Katherine docks  I personally didn't get a bridge view , but I never paid fkr one  I did have a view of the river Thomas  The rooms were cleaned daily,  witb fresh towels a d water every day  They also provided hot drunks as well  There was a fridge,  to put your own drinks in the usual iron,  Broad and hairdryer with a safe as well  They also provide robes and disposal slippers , which for a standard room is a plus  With under heaterinh , which was nice in thr stone bathroom  Room The Hotel was wonderful.   Our Christmas meal was delicious and our afternoon tea was very indulgent on boxing day.  The staff were all incredibly accommodating.  The view from our room was breathtaking; what a sight to wake up to on Christmas day. So I was really worried about staying here after reading reviews. We went with a group so I didn't have a choice in hotel. We also didn't use the check in or out desk since it was taken care of for us. We were assigned room 115 which is technically on the third floor. First floor is reception, lobby, atm, coffee shop, snack area, and restaurant. Second floor was UF ( upper floor) and had the room for the included breakfast, beautiful stairs leading to the first floor and restrooms. Our room had a lovely view of the tower bridge and included a king size bed. We had three people so we were also given a rollaway bed. The rollaway bed does fit an adult but it was thin and not very comfortable.  The room was quite clean and the heating from the ceiling vent worked the whole time. The The front staff Gini is awesome, however, the hotel rooms are very old style and needs renovation to add more led lights and in general more lighting. It would be nice to have some upgraded outlets. The base rooms are very mediocre, however upgraded rooms are decent. We arrived early at 9am and were advised room was free if we wanted to pay an extra £30, declined and just left bags with concierge.  We paid for a twin bedded river view room; the second floor room had an excellent view of the river and Tower Bridge. Entering the hotel the ground and UF level are plush and modern. Bedroom was a good size but fixtures and fittings dated. We returned to hotel at 3pm and went to room to get ready for an early evening meal/ theatre.  Shortly after arrival a maintenance engineer arrived to change the toilet seat ( which didn't appear to be broken) and then spent 40 minutes fitting a new seat.  When we checked the new one was far to small for the toilet and moved when touched. Not sure why this hadn't been done earlier as room was vacant for 6 hours We booked 2 rooms 30 th dec /23 for through Expedia , we noticed the dates where changing online but thought we had finally booked dec dates on arrival at hotel they told us we had booked a month later and even though had lots of rooms charged us for new rooms , ie no help , we called and called Expedia only to find they where closed weekends and then the following week they said no refund or even can’t change dates end of January a month later ? Blaming the hotel ? Os rooms are dates and not worth the money or rubbish service , short sighted  rubbish service won’t use Expedia or tower hotel again and will spread the word about this shameful act , they just want our money , twice , 0-10 The view is unmatched, however, the cleanliness of this hotel is the worst I have ever experienced. The room was extreamly dirty, the batroom did not have warm water, and the toilet would not flush. When talking to the reception they let me stand there for 30 minutes just to tell me they could get me another room but it would be downgraded as i had paid extra for a room with a view for new years.   I felt more dirty leaving the hotel and would not reccoment this to anyone.  Fantastic Hotel in a great location. Staff very friendly and helpful, nothing too much trouble. River view room well worth the extra - stunning. A little expensive but hey its London. Lovely walks around St Catherine's Docks, 2mins from Tower of London and Tube. Hope to be back one day! I have been using the Hotel for many years for both business and pleasure.   Hotel is nicely located but is getting tired and in desperate need of a refresh.   But by far the most disappointing part is the elevators.  You cannot call yourself a quality establishment when it takes guests 40 minutes to get to and from the upper floors.  You need to sort this out. Painfully average for the price. I assume priced was jacked because time of year and location. Service was okay. I asked for some prosecco be brought to the room on the night of the 31st but instead they brought it the day we arrived.  Bathroom tiles were dirty and some of the plumbing was not working as intended (flush and handheld shower head).  For the price i paid for two nights, i expect better attention to detail & frankly the quality for the price i paid.  If you’re planning to stay here and you’re thinking it’s too expensive, it is. even if you think “oh it’s london, it will be worth it”, it’s not. “let’s treat ourselves” , it’s a special occasion”, no.  It wasn’t bad but not worth the price you pay.  There’s places much better and with the tube there’s really no need to We paid alot of money  to stay new years eve   to celebrate  the end of 2023 and the new 2024  . Our room was very old fashioned  the bed mattress  was as old as the hotel  with a big dip in it !   Our shower was hot then cold so we just didnt bother to have a shower till we returned home .  We went down for breakfast  at 10 to find the cooked breakfast in one part of the resturant had been left under a heat lamp and everything  was dried up and un edible  so we settled for toast and yoghurt  . When we complained  at the reception  they refunded our breakfast  but said if id of told them about our mattress  they would of changed it at 2 30 AM  in the morning !  .least to say we wont stay again we'd  get better rooms and service at Premier Inn  ! . Went for anniversary never been before but already booked to go back everything was excellent from when we got there till when we left. Hotel location perfect and everything you might need at the hotel or very close hotel even managed to give us room with view of tower bridge Stayed here many times was always our go to hotel, customer service was terrible, bathroom not clean absolutely disappointed,   javeid in the vicinity bar is excellent, always welcoming, it’s just a shame the rest of the hotel doesn’t match his high standards the  new lifts are still not good enough especially at breakfast time waited 25 minutes yesterday morning for the lift, Hotel is a little dated, bathrooms need a refurb. View is unbeatable and received a free upgrade which included complimentary mini-bar which was a nice touch. Breakfast included which was a usual offering including English breakfast items and continental. Biggest issue for the stay was the elevators, not enough to service the number of people and always overcrowded and with a long wait; not great if you’re staying on a higher floor. Fantastic stay. Really beautiful view of the Tower Bridge. Customers service was top notch. Special shout out to Sree. He looked after us superbly. We were on the sixth floor and had a great view of the Tower Bridge. Room is not as small as I've seen as mentioned by others here. Was sufficient size for the both of us.  Great location for tourists like me and my family. However as I am the traveler the property should be have a freight. I am not sure why they don’t put it in the room anyway we have a great experience here with a nice view and many restaurants near by. Great experience. Montserrat (reception) was very helpful. Rooms are nice with a good view. The breakfast is also good. We enjoyed our 2 day stay between christmas and NYE while it was not too busy. Even during rush breakfast hours it was not too busy. Overall a good experience The hotel and facility where excellent The view from our room of tower bridge was beautiful.  The restaurant downstairs the service was A*. The hotel staff helps us upgrade and gave us late check out. Great hotel with a perfect view (on front and back side) Very friendly staf. Really good food, breakfast and diner are really good. Starbucks inside the hotel, yeahhhh! Love it. I would recommend it highly to everybody who wants to explore Londen. Stayed in this hotel 15th & 16th Of December and found my room had been broken into by three males loitering about the hotel corridors while I was out. Large amount of cash stolen and contacted hotel and got the impression that this has been happening for a while. Emailed and no response from the hotel.  Would never use this hotel again and find it disturbing that they can allow this to happen. Make shift device was used to open the room door from under the door. Police have been contacted and awaiting response.  Hotel is also very outdated, terrible rancid smell about corridors and one of the worst breakfasts I have ever had. Fair to say this was not a good trip. Do NOT stay here. I fell for the social media posts with the beautiful views, and I know that it’s a super popular hotel in a super touristy destination so they will continue to have people book regardless, but if I can convince even just a few 30-40 something couples looking for an awesome stay in London that this place is NOT it, then my work will be done.  My husband and I thought this would be a lovely place to celebrate our winter honeymoon, along with Christmas, and we were SO wrong. They treated us TERRIBLY from the moment we walked in. At around 12:45pm on Christmas Day, after a 17 hour travel day we were told our room would be ready in 2 hours (close to 3pm). We were exhausted and so tired but we understood. We walked around for a little bit and came back after 2 hours The lovely lady Gini is so friendly, I was intending to have an early check-in(arrived at 9am), she recommended to upgrade room, then no need to pay for early checkin fee. More or less same rate but much better room(bigger and nicer view) The systems in room is a bit old, but clean enough. I will definitely recommend The tower hotel to friends!  checked in to a room in the afternoon. Went out and came back in the evening unable to enter my room.  Turns out the hotel staff entered my room, removed my luggage without consent, and my room was given to a another family, probably cause they were white.   The reception manager, Amir was very arrogant and confronted us when we questioned why this change had happened. Very unprofessional, poor experience.   Oh, and there was no hot water for a day... So that was pleasant 🙂 Stayed here for one night only.  Wish we’d stayed longer.  Fantastic location, spacious room, friendly staff.   Read a lot of negative reviews about this hotel so was a bit concerned.  Requested a renovated room.  Don’t think we got a renovated room but we are very happy with it all the same.  We have a family room which has a lounge area with a sofa bed and a separate bedroom, so perfect for our family of three. We will definitely be returning to this hotel next time we come to London!! The Tower Hotel met with evey expectation,  friendly,  comfortable,  clean with good food and great location,  we highly recommend it , and would stay here again in a heartbeat , for easy access to London sights this is the hotel for you 😊  Great staff, beautiful reception and a great location with easy access to the tube and the rest of London.  Enjoyed my stay here thoroughly, the bed was super comfy (and clean) with 24 hour room service. Spacious room with an array of amenities. The bar was great , which can be found on the 1st floor.   only a few small complaints.  1) there is a new policy in place where only 2 adults are allowed in 1 room (as well as one child) which was never the case with my previous stay.  2) the toilet wasn’t the cleanest but we made do with it.  3) AC wasn’t working in the room .\"},\n",

Stayed here for two nights in late June and cannot say enough about this hotel. The entire staff made us feel welcome at all times and bent over backwards to help us with our every need. They were absolute perfection!   Our room was a budget room but it was beautiful, clean and fairly spacious for a budget room. Loved the Nespresso coffee machine and all of the many goodies and drinks provided in the room were free of charge....HOW FANTASTIC IS THAT!!!! The bed was heavenly and we slept extremely well. Because it was a budget room...the bathroom was tiny...but it had a wonderful rainfall shower and was extremely clean. If you need a bigger bathroom...I would suggest you ask for an upgrade if it is not too expensive. When in the room we had a few questions and requests...which It was our first stay at the Clermont hotel Victoria and I must say It was stunning what a beautiful grand building full of character and history the entrance is spectacular all the staff were very friendly and helpful especially the doorman he was a lovely chap. The central location is great so close to all amenities and so easy to travel to other parts of London and near all the great attractions. Very nice touches in the room was also provided including nespresso coffee machine water, cokes, and alcohol in the fridge and crisps and sweets those extra personalised touches was very nice. We would highly recommend it thanks again to everyone at the Clermont hotel for making our stay so comfortable and enjoyable. What a lovely hotel in an excellent location for exploring and travelling around London. The staff were very welcoming. We were able to leave our luggage there before we checked in and after we checked out so we didn’t have to carry it around with us. Snacks and drinks in the room were complimentary and they came round to offer us more snacks. Lovely cocktail bar and the staff were very attentive in there also.  Only negative- we were surprised when we asked at reception that they didn’t know what earplugs were and didn’t have any. This is something most hotels offer! This was the 2nd time we had  stayed at this hotel. An impressive building located at Victoria station, so ideal for travelling around the city. Friendly, helpful staff and the rooms are of a very good standard. Would also  recommend the cocktail bar! This hotel was absolutely beautiful! My younger sister and I stayed for two nights, and I had booked this because of the close proximity to the station and the theatre.   The room was the perfect size for both of us and very good value. The service was fantastic from everyone there.  The only issue we had was that the breakfast did not seem to reflect the expectations of a 4-star establishment and that there was nowhere to really hang up towels in the bathroom.  This was our first stop on our honeymoon trip and it was a wonderful experience in a great neighborhood! After flying in from NY overnight, we were delighted to find out that our room was ready way before check in time which enabled us to get some much needed rest before exploring London - it was the BEST part of our honeymoon! Friendly staff, clean & comfortable room, and gorgeous hotel beautifully decorated for the holidays! Beautiful hotel. The lobby area is stunning. Comfy rooms, with free coffee, tea, biscuits, soft drinks and sweets. Lovely breakfast. All the staff were really helpful. Situated at Victoria station, so really convenient too. Would highly recommend The rooms are heated,  but not the hotel overall. It is very cold in here. The bath water would not run hot, so we heated water in the tea kettle to help make a warm bath. Must wear a scarf in the hallways. We asked about this, but were dismissed for even asking. We tried to secure a bottle of wine after midnight and were told to call Uber Eats, which did not work. Surprising for a \"4 star\" hotel in a metropolitan city such as London. Room service ends after 10:30p.m. We inquired about checking out in the morning, so we could go to an actual \"4 star\" hotel and told we would still be charged for a second night. I would not recommend this hotel if you are used to good service, a warm hotel and a hot bath. Soooooo disappointed. We stayed here for my husbands 60th birthday. Everything was fabulous from start to finish. Wonderful staff, comfortable room and delicious breakfast. The room was huge and bed was so comfortable. We even got a complementary g&t!  We will definitely be back. We stayed here 5 nights because of the location and the tours /trains we wanted to take in our 2 week in England. The hotel was perfectly close to the train and coach stations. Close by are multitude of stores. The hotel itself was clean and lovely. We had a King deluxe room. It was really big and the bathroom was very roomy. I also like that you can open a window in the room and bathroom. Large luscious towels and a towel heater. Nice/ bath shower. Large bed. Was a bit too soft for me, but we slept relatively well. Water and snacks were supplied daily. Nice touch. Would stay there again. AMAZING. We have just spent 4 days at this wonderful hotel. Welcome and check-in, TOP,  Miss. Brunilda very prepared and kind. The room equipped with all comforts. Location close to Victoria Station, with an entrance directly from the station.Fast checkout, special thanks to Aleksi at the reception, very friendly. All the top staff.  a very nice and well-kept hotel. The staff at reception and at the bar are very friendly. Humaiya, the lady at reception, gave me a very warm welcome and gave me excellent advice on all my questions. Thank you very much We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. Excellent stay. Hotel accessible from Victoria Station (direct line to Gatwick Airport) but quiet at the same time. The rooms are very modern and the staff really helpful. Excellent breakfast. Big hotel but you dont feel the crowd. Would definitely recommend to my friends and family There are so many things The Clermont do well - the rooms, breakfast, decor etc but the check in process is slow and awful. Worse than that is the inability to get a copy of invoices for expenses. Three times I\\'ve tried to chase, you either can\\'t get through on the phone or someone says they will send something and don\\'t. For this reason alone, I will elect not to book here as it\\'s a headache for expenses especially given nobody answers the phone! shower was dirty with hair, front of house was rude, room service for one drink was slow (45mins), tv wouldn’t connect to the wifi and the view from the window was dreadful. The bed was comfy, but struggle to think of many more positives. We booked 3 nights at the Clermont, Victoria, during our Christmas holiday. What a beautiful hotel. The entrance with the Christmas decorations gave us a warm feeling coming home from a lovely day of shopping and discovering London.   What made our stay \"excellent\" was the extra attention our 1-year old son got from the Clermont staff. Every breakfast he got his own private dinner show, and a Clermont teddy bear. Thank you for the pleasant stay.  Great location, very nice lobby, spacious room for a European hotel and very comfortable king size bed. Why 4 stars and not 5? The front desk staff was not helpful at all when we asked if we could check in earlier than 3pm after an overnight flight from the United States. This stay was my second stay at the Clermont.  Prior to this one, I stayed here when it was the Grosvenor.  The convenience and location to public transportation, elegance of the hotel itself and the eminently walkable area of its location to London makes it my go-to hotel.  I can happily say I would never stay anywhere else.  Loved the quiet rooms and the location adjacent to Victoria Station was very convenient. The staff was friendly and helpful. They remembered you and the conversations you had with them. Would definitely stay here again.  I stayed here last year at Xmas with my daughter and returned this year with my 88 year old Mum. The hotel is in such a great location, but more important is that this hotel has a team of people who go above and beyond. Aleks and the others on reception can’t do enough for you and Mario and his team at breakfast were just superb helping me with Mum. In context, I consult in Customer Experience, so this is a big call for me to post such a fantastic review. We had an amazing stay in the hotel. The service was great, the staff was very friendly. They helped us with directions, getting a taxi etc. The hotel is beautiful. Location is perfect if you want to walk to a lot of tourist places, also next to the bus stand, taxi stand and underground.  The breakfast was great and Isabel was so sweet and friendly.  The restaurant Soak was also great, we loved the dim sum very much. This hotel  is in the perfect location above the Victoria Station. Close to Buckingham Palace and Big Ben. Close to busses, trains and tube. We stayed here for five nights and it was very nice and comfortable. We had a simple room with two beds and the bed were very comfortable. There is a pillow menu that you can choose from.  The checkin was fast and efficient and the staff was very nice.  The only negative was that the second elevator was broken the entire time we were there so the wait for the lift was long. After we checked out they fixed the second elevator =).  We will definitly stay here next time in London. We had a large group, with all ages. When we arrived nobody had helped us with our bags to the lobby. My grandmother in law fell and they “offered” to dry clean her clothes because she bled on them. Come to find out they charged her room for the service. We ordered a car service for the night before an event, we specified we needed plenty of room for people and luggage; a 4 passenger car was sent instead and we were left to also order an Uber. The rooms are painfully small- thankfully we didn’t spend much time there. The rooms were clean and well stocked. The hotel is centrally located and close to the train station. The bar makes a great espresso martini We stayed at the Clermont Victoria for 5 days in October before heading to Scotland. I had made arrangements through the hotel for an airport transfer from Heathrow and the service and driver were top notch.   Upon arrival, the front desk staff was kind enough to check us in early and after a long transatlantic flight it was much appreciated. We had a Superior Room and we were more than happy with it. Very large and spacious with high ceilings and a lot of natural light.  The bed itself was extremely comfortable and the pillows and bedding were perfect. Loved that you could select your own comfort pillow for a good nights sleep. The room was always clean and tidy and was made up daily. Also, we enjoyed having the complimentary bar and snacks which were replenished daily. I’d The Clermont, Victoria is the best hotel at which we have stayed in London during many visits.  Check in was fast and easy and our room was ready at 12 noon on the date of check in.  Rooms are a good size and well equipped with everything we needed, including great pillows and a warm duvet.  The hotel offers complimentary water and soda in the mini-fridge as well as coffee and snacks that were replenished throughout our stay.  The hotel\\'s location directly behind Victoria Station is conveniently located.  We were able to walk to Buckingham Palace, Mayfair and Westminster.  We will plan to return to The Clermont, Victoria very soon. Lovely hotel, bebs are super comfortable, underfloor heating wow, and the staff are excellent, From Front of house to the snug restaurant.  What a great place and were also greated by a double rainbow when we looked out our window. For me, the hospitality industry is all about delivering a seamless customer service experience. This is definitely not what we received at The Clermont Victoria. It seems that the management had a difficult time to understand that one bad customer experience can have an immense impact on the reputation of the hotel, and consequently on the lost of potential guests coming back to the property. After staying 7 nights and spending $2773.00 on BB (Bed and breakfast only), we checked out very dissatisfied, and we have no desire to come back.    We booked a Deluxe King Room (#419). The room was fine; on a smaller side and the bathroom can’t accommodate more than one person at the time. This is not a problem, we are used to the centre London accommodations and space is definitely a Stay at the Clermont during the Christmas season and you will be charmed! The lobby is decorated beautifully, you will be warmly greeted and the bellman will deliver your bags to your rooms so you can begin your day. The rooms are spotless and the daily service is impeccable. Every single service person that we encountered was friendly and yet professional. Obviously well trained. The beds were comfortable and the lighting was good and the room had enough space for our two large suitcases and masses of shopping bags after four days.  We especially enjoyed the ability to make a cup of tea before bed. Nice touch. We ate in restaurant and had drinks in the bar and both were lovely. The hotel is attached to the Victoria tube station so if the weather is wet, you don\\'t need to go My wife and I have stayed at the Clermont on a number of occasions and have always found it an ideal place to stay to enjoy London , the staff are really helpful friendly and the facilities first class . A must stay ..  We had a lovely stay here. Would definitely return the next time I am in London! The Christmas tree in the lobby gave it the perfect ambiance. The breakfast was pretty pricey but just okay.  The daily water and snacks in the room were a great touch. Overall,  great stay. This hotel is beautiful and the customer service is top notch. From our arrival to departure the team was helpful, thoughtful and accommodating to our group of 9 - including our your children. Food at The Soak was awesome, particularly dim sum, and the drinks at Reunion were great. Location is great for transportation and a short walk to Buckingham Palace, St James Park, Westminster Abbey and other great attractions. It’s directly connected to Victoria station which is helpful to get to other areas of London. We definitely enjoyed our time at the Clermont London Victoria and would return again.  The hotel is really great and centrally located, so you can get everywhere on foot and by metro. Nice spacious family room. Very clean. The service and check-in and check-out were very good.  This is the second time I\\'ve stayed at this hotel and I would happily stay there again.  The staff were great, very friendly and helpful, nothing too much trouble. The room was quiet and the mattress very comfortable. I loved the Victorian charm of the hotel, wide corridors, high ceilings and period design all nicely renovated. Lovely. Very attractive building with some good original features. Nice large room but ours had a slight musty / smoke odour. The bar was directly below our room so the music could be heard quite loudly in the room on Friday night until around one am. This was a welcome surprise not mentioned at check in, however, I didn’t like the playlist on this particular evening. Very little jazz. The breakfast is buffet style, so was more quantity over quality. The sausages were particularly uninspiring. My girlfriend is from London, and so, quite pretentious. She would not eat any of the items included in the buffet, which meant we had to spend additional money in Pret. The room’s bathroom is well appointed but the toilet is not able to handle the results of a buffet style breakfast, and only two Wicked themed afternoon tea bought as part of a trip to see Wicked. The themed afternoon tea was really good with a good selection of everything you would expect from a traditional afternoon tea. The themed cocktail (The Wicked) was lovely and very well priced at £10. The thing that made it for us was that they presented our granddaughter with a branded teddy bear. The two staff in the tea room were very pleasant (didn’t get their names).  The only negative was that the hotel reception was unwelcoming (no one on the door) and without a good nose for where to go we would have struggled to find the Tea Room, a well placed sign would have helped. As a recent visitor to the Tea Lounge on Clemort Street in London, I am delighted to share my experience. The atmosphere of the lounge strikes a perfect balance between elegance and comfort, making it an ideal spot for a relaxing afternoon tea. The decor is tastefully done, creating a warm and inviting ambiance.  The highlight of my visit was definitely the afternoon tea selection. The sandwiches were exceptionally fresh, each bite offering a delightful mix of flavors and textures. However, the sweets, particularly the cakes and scones, were a bit of a letdown as they felt somewhat dry.  The service at the Tea Lounge deserves a special mention. The staff were attentive and professional, enhancing the overall experience. Our server, Mohammed, was particularly commendable for his Jamie, Jeban and the bar staff provided GREAT service. The drinks were unique and enjoyable We would return and suggest you stop by for a Holiday drink. Grab a friend or family member.. Until next time. It was a pleasure to spend an evening at this establishment In particular the service of Naella, Arnell and Jamie was of extraordinary quality Although they wouldn\\'t play our song request we had a great time overall Exceptional service from Jamie in the bar at the soak and he also served us in reunion! again  exceptional service. the atmosphere in the bar was good loads of Xmas parties happening.  we stay the night room was amazing  mini fridge with free goodies what a super touch we will definitely be returning very soon '},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': \"Lara and Chelsea were great! Excellent service and attentive.  It’s a travel lodge so you always know what you are going to get.  In my experience the staff really make all the difference and that’s the case here too.  Great vibes. Really great hotel! Handy location and good brand value, but as always difference is made by effective staff. Check-in was efficient - quickly dealing with a corporate booking error - and room very clean. Bonus was Chelsea and Lara on the bar: quick to respond, happy to chat whilst sorting out food (large pizza) and a glass of wine and (again) efficient. If you want high-end hotel, look elsewhere: if you want clean, functional, good value (especially in Central London) consider this one. The place is nicely located with easy access to public transport.  The hotel was clean and the staff were very friendly.  Overall a good impression.  Breakfast was well stocked and a wide variety which was excellent.  Would definately stay here again. Value for money Best points are the location near three tube stops and the breakfast has a lot of choice. The rooms are pretty basic and very warm as there doesn’t seem to be any air circulation so would be so hot in summer. Also, there is a dead bird on the roof over the breakfast tables which has obviously been there for quite a while, lazy to not clean the glass roof especially with a dead bird on it Great hotel! Fabulous staff… Rebekah and Darron were such amazing bartenders! Great cocktails and they were friendly and attentive and they went out of their way to make our visit memorable! Room was clean and fresh and comfortable! Great place to stay in London Amazing service. Darron and Rebekah are extremely welcoming and offer the best experience for a Travel Lodge we have ever had! Head to the bar for a delicious cocktail and overall a great experience. Checking in was easy and being able to leave your bag is a great add on! The most amazing bartender Daren, very talented!!! Very attentive and very so helpful. I was second guessing my choice of staying and he really changed my perspective on this side of London, He was great guide just arriving in London and when your trying to find your place . Stayed at the travel lodge for a night with my group of friends. Amazing bar service. The bartender Daren was an excellent server. Would totally recommend to others. Great prices and delicious quality. Darron was a delight best bartender ive ever had will use him everyday. Darron is a asset to travellodge i will defo come here again just to see Darron. He is the best better than all the rest, better than anyone, anyone ive ever met. Thanks for a wonderful experience We stayed here after a business trip with the husband on New Year's day. Despite other hotels being available this was the most convenient with regards to all the amnesties. Apart from the small beds, for a budget friendly hotel we thought it was a very pleasant stay.   The staff were excellent and catered to our demands of what we requested with regards to the room.  The breakfast had a wide variety and for my dietary needs had great options.  Only downfall like i said was the size of the double bed but maybe we could have requested a kings bed.   Overall pleasant stay for a budget friendly hotel. The location of the hotel was the only good thing about it. We didnt get a room service in the 4 nights we stayed at the hotel. After the first night, i asked for a toilet brush, because who wants to leave his toilet dirty? they told me that the room service will clean our toilets, thats why we didnt get one. i was clearly upset because i didnt make sense why i couldnt leave my toilet clean by myself. i was with a friend and we shared our bathroom, so we wanted to keep our toilet clean. we had so many towels and so much trash in our room because nobody from the service came to clean Positives: - Location - smell of ammonia (means they cleaned) - elevators  Not so great: - smell of ammonia (not something you want walking into your room) - elevators are tiny, we had to wait often and skip rides when people had luggage or there were 4+ people. Only 2 out of 3 were working. - windows are not soundproof, we heard conversations from the street - interior doors are not soundproof, we heard lots of noise from the hallway - interior fire doors are narrow and difficult to navigate with large luggage - waited over an hour after requesting a hair dryer, only after following up it was provided. That should have been in the room, it is a standard item. - smoke detector light was blinking, it was distracting at night. - light spilled through the room door  The staff here are beyond helpful to make your stay feel 5 star!! Big Thankyou to Nira, I'm a regular here & she always greets me with a big smile and passion for customer satisfaction ( it’s why I come back time and time again!) The rooms are always clean & the bar area great if your needing to work on the go.  Highly recommend 😁 Great service and very clean. We had our annual party in London and was a perfect place to spend the night.  I would highly recommend this specific Tavelodge whether for personal or business.  A bar and restaurant is also onsite. Great location for where we wanted to go. Rooms very clean and comfy. Have to mention the reception staff Sabbir and his buddy (can’t remember name sorry) who were brilliant and very helpful. He asked us to wait in the bar whilst sorting out rooms and gave us complimentary drinks even tho we literally only had to wait a couple of minutes. Great service thanks Sabbir  The best location ever in central London. Near to train station, bus stop, market and restaurant. All staff were kind. The room was very clean and very comfortable. It was easy to access every touristic point by foot.  Clean and functional with professional friendly staff.Good value for money. Would stay there again at present price level. Appreciated ease of access to the underground. A good base for exploring the City and the area around the hotel is quite historic too Comfortable, clean stay. New refurbished rooms are perfect for a short weekend break. Special mention to Sabbir for his exceptionally pleasant and seamless check in. Assisted us with our questions and helped us out when we were in a rush. Thanks Sabbir Had a great stay over here. After a hell of a flight with many delays we received a warm welcome. Really friendly and helpful staff. A highlight for us was the special table Darron and the staffmembers arranged for our daughters engagement. So a big compliment for the customer service Very kind and helpful staff, especially Max who is always ready to help you. Strong point: Excellent position and breakfast.Location close to three underground and at the exit from the door of Travelodge there is the bus stop.Unlimited and free breakfast up to 15 years old.  Weak point: the cleaning of the camera was never done, every day you can change the towels by asking for them. Not very organized between them, especially at dinner time.  The reception and bar/restaurant area is always tidy and clean. Possibility to have dinner in Travelodge, it's convenient price and confortable. For London it is a good compromise between quality and price in the area. I would stay here again. Nicole  I went with my girlfriend and had the worst experience related to accommodation I ever had. Our flight was late so we only managed to get to the hotel at 6am. The check-in process took around 30minutes which is was obviously not convenient for us due to how tired we where but it is understandable. When we got to our room, the bed was not tidied up, we only had one towel (the second one was on the floor of the toilet, to serve the purpose of absorbing the water from the shower), there were what looked like blood stains in the duvet and the shower didn't have a shower curtain. We tried our best to understand these are thing that can happen and politely went to talk with the reception to have our problems solved and when  we got back to our room we had two towels, a shower curtain convenient location, nice room, but to our surprise in three days the bed was never made, the tea cups that were made available to us were never cleaned, and the bathroom was never cleaned. To our request for information, we were told that the rooms are cleaned every seven days. Positive note that they provide free luggage storage service. Hotel located in an area close to public transport and underground; nice compromise for stay in London. Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. The bar and restaurant is poorly organized and in total confusion; but a special to Max for is availability to help us. Room cleaning and linen changes non-existent. Very good hotel for affordable prices in central London. Staff very accommodating and friendly, you feel seen as a person. Early check-in! Luggage drop off before check-in possible.  Breakfast not expensive and good.  The hotel has been refurbished. Convenient location, with a bus stop in the door and two tube stations less than 10min walking. Very friendly and helpful staff. Tea and coffee available in the bedroom. Overall clean hotel and a nice room with comfortable bed (in the super room). Location was excellent with many cafes/restaurants and a supermarket next to it. Also 2 underground stations very near. The windows didn’t really cover the noises from outside but it was fine with earplugs you were able to sleep just fine.  Traveled to London during Christmas and absolutely enjoyed the stay. It’s a small but very well managed hotel. Located in a nice area, quiet, clean, and has great staff. When I arrived, I was having the worst jet lag and migraine. Hannah at the front desk did the best to help me out. It really made my day. A very heart warming experience when traveling to a foreign country alone. Will return again if I visit London.  very good value hotel, having recently been refreshed everything was in working order and a pleasant stay. check in was quick and easy despite the large amount of people checking in. highly recommend.  This was the cheapest hotel at this time but it was still very expensive considering what you get for the price. It was very hot inside the hotel and in the room and there wasn’t air conditioning. Overall an okay experience  Humaira is just amazing. She was so lovely to talk to and very helpful. Dyrell on reception was amazing too he was making me laugh alot. Ben was so lovely. He was so nice. Lindon was adorable he was very surprised. Lastly, Darren he was  serving at the bar and looked after me Bad service, unclean linen and poor fixtures and fittings.   Fire alarm went off at 21:15pm without any notice to customers.  One of the lifts wasn't working for the 2 days that I stayed there.  Poor customer service.  The manager was surprised that I complained. Food was absolutely awful. In our room the shower was overflowing with water as it was not draining quickly enough. Room very tired and just given a couple of tea sachets was not enough. Jennifer in the restaurant, front desk and bar staff lovely and welcoming Like the title says book if you like the temperature hot, and the noise levels high both from inside and outside the hotel. A relaxing break away with my wife it wasn't and couldn't wait to get home on our own bed. Came in between Xmas and new year. Really good location. Away from the busy area of London. Tube 5 min walk. Would recommend for anyone families who want to get away from the centre of London. Hotel breakfast was spot on! Good choice for all. Room was basic. Only time we spent time in the room was to sleep  No wifi, no service  no inbetween cleaning or fresh towels. Rooms are way too hot. The rooms are small  especially family rooms. For a little bit more money you can find better hotels. Would not recommend this hotel.  The travel lodge location was perfect , bus stop right outside the door, the rooms were clean and comfortable, the staff couldn’t do enough for us Sheniz, Hannah and all bar staff, restaurant staff were brilliant, breakfast was great food choices, evening meal was great value for money . We were happy with our stay and have already recommended the hotel to friends and family, we would definitely stay again, Thankyou to the staff for having us 😊 Thank you Michelle!  After arriving at another hotel for our anniversary, to find out I'd stupidly booked the 29th January instead of 29th December, I was in a right old panic to find somewhere to stay! We arrived at this Travelodge and were greeted by an incredibly beautiful and kind hearted manager, Michelle who treated us so kindly after hearing about our wrong booking etc. Michelle took time to chat with myself and my husband. This lady is a true credit to the Travelodge management team and would be an amazing manager at any hotel. Never felt so welcome at any hotel before, you made our anniversary special. Good hotel location on a main road but noise from outside is well managed. Good customer care but breakfast choices are abit limited and our bathroom cleaning materials were compromised other than that, this is a good place and pocket friendly.  Had a very poor experience saying at this hotel. Reported several times that the TV did not work and the toilet seat was hanging off. Breakfast chaotic and unable to keep up with demand. Overall disappointing  Room supposedly ‘ super ‘ have had better standard , partner slipped in shower , staff didn’t want to know , but sneaked in our room and placed a sign , ignoring empty soap dispenser, also refused help on drinks machine that took money for no drink s , room was asked for refresh , ignored , worst Travelodge experience after dozens of regular stays \"},\n",

No Aircon, but very hot because of central heating which you can\\'t control, you can\\'t open the window because of the noise!  Shower mixer very funny, takes 10min to adjust. In my opinion very expensive for what you get. For one night car pak is NOT included!  Friendly staff and clean and well-located Hotel. I highly recommend it. One thing I really like is the closeness to Euston and St Pancras stations. That makes it ideal to visit London. Only thing I would suggest is to publicise more any tours offered around the city. This hotel is beautiful, in an great location, and not too far from a selection of convenient tube stations. So excellent location to get anywhere, particularly the Piccadilly line with direct service to Heathrow. This is now our hotel of choice in London. The team made us feel special and welcomed even before we arrived - true hospitality at its best! A special thank you to Wency and Don from the Concierge for not just great customer service but for being proactive and empathetic. If you want to treat yourself, you can’t do better than to book the Royal National Hotel.  Great facilities with fantastic staff including Mir. My partner had some mobility issues and all staff were very supportive and accommodating to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible.  Thank you royal national team.   The hotel staff are very kind and enthusiastic, and the hotel is very responsible in looking after the luggage. And I would like to mention Philip, the night manager of the hotel, who was very helpful, very responsible, a very good manager, many thanks to him It has been our third time staying at Royal National and we highly recommend it. The breakfast has improved a lot (gluten free options, nice bread, fresh fruit and hot options too), new rooms and great and helpful people working. We want to thank Olga for her kindness and support. There are some bus stops really close to the hotel and supermarkets too. Location is perfect. me and my best friend travelled to london for new years for the fireworks and stayed in this perfectly situated hotel. at the reception desk upon arrival we were greeted by Abdul. He made sure our room was ready for us before due time after travelling early hours in the morning and wished us a wonderful stay. We did indeed have a wonderful stay and the security in the hotel was amazing and very considered and appreciated at this busy time of year. All members of staff which we communicated with were lovely and if we were to go back would defiantly look into this hotel again. you certainly get what u pay for. Thank you especially to Abdul and i hope he gets a raise !!! I think this a fantastic hotel. They accommodated us checking in a little early, which meant everything to us, as exhausted as we were. I experienced some confusion in our lobby, as the gentlemen there were never quite identified, as either security or as doormen. A couple times, someone acted as a doorman, which was very appreciated, but then other times, such as when we left, they just stood there when my husband and I were obviously encumbered with our baggage. It would help if that were more clearly defined to help manage guests’ expectations. The breakfast they  serve is phenomenal. We purchased it twice and enjoyed it very much. I believe it is worth the fee.  That being said, having a tiny mini fridge where we could keep cheese and bread for a quick breakfast before we Very good stay.  With a smiling welcome every morning from MIR. Care and friendliness at the appointment Kindness kindness was present. The hotel is well located and The breakfast is nice A very pleasant stay hotel very well located, the room is pleasant with a bedding at the top! The couple who manage this hotel is very pleasant and attentive!! We\\'ll be back!!! \" \"Welcome at the top and comfort at the appointment. We are very happy with the stay here, because of the helpful and friendly hotel workers, specially Mir, that‘s a hotel worker that was very helpful and patient with us. I wanna thank her specially. Without her our stay at the Hotel never would be as nica as it was. Bed is very cumfortable. Staff is very polite and helpfull aspecially at breakfast mrs. Mir. Room is very clean and everything is on disposal. Everything is very well organized. I enjoy ghe stay. Stay is also very quiet. Mir is a very nice an lovely person  thank you for your kindness I’m very happy to be here in London, it’s a  very pretty city .So it’s a perfect place to celebrate my birthday .It could’nt be a better place First time in London, was concerned this was far from things, but it was not. There is an underground (tube) stop 5 minutes away and another for other underground lines 10 minutes away that takes you everywhere in the city. We also walked most places since we enjoyed seeing things along the way. Everything was clean. Very happy with our stay.  Abdol gives us very good service, such a nice experience! The location is very good, right in the city center, and the service is very good. Transportation is very convenient, not far from the subway station, you can always find good restaurants and shopping malls. We have stayed a few times and always had great experience. The customer service I received at the Royal National Hotel was outstanding. First and foremost I reached out to concierge for planning assistance. Wency was truly amazing! So helpful, so thorough and extremely patient, many thanks to Wency! I was really pleased with the service and will definitely visit again.  We stayed here for 2 nights and it was a mixed experience. Good location and easy to find. Room was disappointing as it was a twin room and I had asked for a double. Room was basic and clean.Bathroom was tiny and lacked any comfort.  We went to the London Pub for food on the second night and the waitress was really very abrupt and rude. We could here he telling the bar man she didn\\'t want to take the order when he told he we were ready and eventually when she did come to serve us, she made that clear in her manner. There was an issue with the payment and there was no niceness from her until a more competent and professional manager came to speak to us. The same waitress came back with drinks later that evening and she again was just plain rude, no please or thanks or general I would love to appreciate the help that Miss. Olga provided. She is very professional and full of patience and trying her best to get us a really nice room. This is a great experience in Royal National Hotel and we will come back next time! Everything was okay to stay there, except for the window noise, we were on the sixth floor but our window lock was broken so it was very loud every night. If the rooms were less noisy i would comr back. Overall it is a good hotel with a very good location Excellent Service from Hotel Management . I checked earlier today, experienced a small hiccup, requested the assistance of Bakri, the Duty Manager. He sprung to action and resolved my issue in less than 5 mins. Extraordinary customer service thanks to Bahkri  The hotel is huge and it can easily take over half an hour to check in. I had a tiny single room that was very basic and unattractive. The central heating was broken and over-heated the room to a sauna-like temperature. Very poor wifi. My room was very quiet. The bathroom is very cozy and nice. The only thing is the light. It’s impossible to have the room completely dark.   But the position is amazing. You are in central london a few steps away from shopping and most of the attractions.   Abdul at reception was very welcoming and nice.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially Olga. We were given a superior room. All the details were top quality and new. The bathroom was clean and fully renovated, and the beds were so comfortable! It is very well located, only 2min from subway and bus station. The hotel is large, but we didn’t have any problems at all with noise from neighbors or the street. We are delighted with the visit and will repeat for sure :) Never stayed here before but chose it because it was near an event we were doing. Quick and easy check in with the room available early. Very clean and comfortable room with all we needed. Hotel was very quiet at all hours and in a great location very near tube stops and shops/restaurants. We did pay £210 a night which I do think is expensive, but then it is London at Christmas clean comfy quiet room despite being near elevator- hot on arrival but opening window and easily controlled heating enabled ambient temperature to be quickly reached-  bathtub was a real welcome bonus in a generous size bathroom- excellent lighting in room all controlled from bedside switches Lovely hotel in a nice, quiet location with tube and bus stops easily accessible.  Several good restaurants and shops close by.  Room is appropriate size with good storage areas; bathroom is quite small; shower is a bit slippery and the bathroom floor will get wet during your shower. The breakfast is exceptional with quite a few selections; the dining staff are very attentive. Overall, it was a great experience and a hotel I would recommend. A lovely hotel with clean facilities and a nice staff! The food was good too and rooms were very quiet and comfortable. Room service every day with new towels, tea and coffee. In total a very pleasant stay where I would love to come back  Great rooms, awesome breakfast, really nice and smileing ppl who work there. The hotel is located close to russel square and the underground trains get you to any where in London really quick... note to any one... ALLWAYS use your creditcard in the subway! its way cheeper then any thing els.  Big Hotel but very good rooms. Service was very good. Specially Blooms restaurant was really good, pizza\\'s were great and the coffee was very good. Thanks Madhu,Maria,Jarn, Auibilli, Isuni, BAnigh and Suiksh for your personal touch.  Felt like home I received great customer service from Mr Wency and Mr Mohamadu at the concierge, who helped with recommendations getting around London and checking my luggage at the hotel. Their above and beyond service and warm, welcoming attitude are greatly appreciated!  We had booked 2 x twin rooms. When we arrived, and with proof of booking at hand, we were told we had only booked 1 x twin room. An hour later  the reception staff conceded that their reservation staff had spelt the name of the person staying in second twin room wrong.... after a disastrous checking in, it didn\\'t get better in the room.... the plug sockets weren\\'t working. After 2 hours of tooing and froing it turned out to be a faulty kettle blowing the fuse, so off the technician went with the faulty kettle promising to return with a new one, never to be seen again.  To add to this, don\\'t expect to go to sleep before 2am if you are staying in a room overlooking the courtyard, which was exceptionally noisy with party goers from the hotels own function rooms. Visit London often would stay again.  Greeted with a smile by the young man Jannai.  we was polite and helpful and answered all my questions (manager in the making !).  Room good size, clean and had a kettle.  Bathroom modern and good water pressure.  Did not eat at hotel.  Good location near tube and restaurants etc.   Our tour operator booked a twin room instead of a double room. Which we origanally booked. Towqeer fixed this problem, so thank you for that! We came from holland for a 4 day trip, and we had a good time! If you’re traveling with a wheelchair user do not book this hotel. The accessible rooms may have a walk in shower but you can’t get into the room in the first place! The lifts are tiny, the halls are narrow and the rooms are not wheelchair accessible. We actually had to move to a non accessible room to access the room!!  We had a room 300 pound for the night which was one of the cheapest around for the time of year. Room was big with three single beds and very clean. Staff were very friendly. We didn’t have breakfast so can’t comment on that. We did have a great pizza from the little Italian two minute walk away. Location was good for getting around London bus stop straight outside for Camden market about fifteen minutes away. Check in was a little long but was extremely busy and tv could have been bigger for the room size, but for the time we were actually in our room not a major issue. I am currently in a room here. The have charged me 295 pounds for a room where booking says 245. The room is expensive for what it is: old, small and with a strange odor. The stuff is very bad well educated. The treated us very bad. We felt discriminated against. Nobody help us, they treated very very badly.  I want to sue them through consumer protection. Comfortable rooms, very central location, breakfast buffet fine for the price, there’s good choice and although the quality is fair, it sets you up just fine for the rest of the day. Check-in and checkout are very fast and you can walk to the west end. We had the best time there. The room was big, and the beds where comfy. I had my wheelchair with me, and it fit in the room, without problems.breakfast was realy good, and general staff was smiley and friendly and just there, when you needed them. Only minus, for me,  as handicapped , was the Doors and doorsteps, they dont work for wheelchair users. And in the room, the bathtub, its not good for handicapped with mobility issues either. But other then that. Its a realy good hotel. And we will be back again. Merry Christmas to all  The staff is veey kind and Olga is simply the best!. Breakfast is correct and rooms are wide, clean and confortable. The hotel is pretty close to lot of interest places of the city. I really recomend it for tourism and business.   I hesitated before sharing my experience here, but Wency’s service at the Royal National Hotel made my stay excellent. He was eager to provide helpful recommendations for nearby attractions and dining options. The hotel was in the perfect location for everything. It was a pleasure to stay here! '},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': \"Very nice hotel, the various staff at the front desk were very friendly and helpful. The room was also very clean. The facilities were very good. The location is very convenient, right next to Covent Garden. Highly recommended. I arrived just before 5pm, already late for a business event so I checked in and asked to leave my luggage in the luggage room, so I could race away. The doorman realised that I'd gotten lost on the way to the luggage room and was so helpful in proactively showing me the way; then he realised I had a room, and offered to take my bag up to my room for me so I didn't have to faff when I got back later that night. It was so appreciated.  When I got back later than evening, I arrived at the room to find it absolutely spotless. The man at check-in, Ravnak (sorry if I've spelt this incorrectly!) , gave me a complimentary upgrade to a twin room which was great and the room was well furnished. They provide 2 reusable water bottles and filling stations throughout the hotel, so you can Super service from everyone (shout out to Hasan on reception) but really felt very welcome overall. Quiet clean and comfortable rooms and stylish dining and bar. Great location off Covent Garden. Can’t ask for more. I look forward to my stays here for business. We had a lovely stay at the hotel. We were a group of friends spending the weekend together. Considering how many rooms I had booked Rob made our checking in very smooth. He was polite, professional and very patient with us ladies! He went out of his way to make sure that our rooms were very close to each other. One of our friends couldn’t make it due to personal reasons and Rob went over and beyond to ask (convince!) management if she could use her room on another day….Rob could have easily not asked and say it can’t be done. Thank you Rob! This stay exeeded our expectations.  We were kindly given a complementary upgrade and we could not have been happier.  Putting that aside though - the service overall was excelent - the room exceptionally clean - the bed (including the pillows) super comfy.  The breakfast was good.  The location was superb - giving us a fab base to explore the West end/ Covent Garden.  We were also able to leave our bags for the day without extra costs after checking out, we found this invaluable.  On our next visit to the City, this will be most certainly our first hotel option. I enjoyed my stay as usual until disaster struck when my bank card disappeared (lost or stolen?) in the Underground. Stranded without a card in contactless London is no joke and I was very upset. However, the Strand Palace lived up to its service reputation in the person of reception staffer Riazul, whose helpful, kind and sensible response to my problem saved the day for me. Thank you Riazul! I look forward to my next London trip. Overall a lovely stay, all staff we bumped into were friendly and check in was super fast and early - we only asked to leave our bags but a room was ready!   When we got to the room the TV was broken but it was literally swapped for a brand new tv within half an hour.   We did have a wake up call at 7.30 when the cleaners entered our room when we had do not disturb on, very bizarre, we wonder if it had fallen off to warrent someone walking in so early calling out to us, but then when we did leave for breakfast at about 8 she was waiting asking if we were done - no..... when we left the room 2hr before check out she was again stood waiting to get in, so made us wonder was this how we had a room available when we arrived, was it because the cleaners wake everyone up early trying I walked in for a lite bite and drinks to try smoked salmon but unfortunately it wasn’t available, but one of Strand Palace employee Amrut suggested Chicken Satay and Squid which was delicious and his service was quite good. Looking forward to visit again. Cheers!!!! This hotel is in a super location and the room was clean and comfortable, unfortunately the check in time was 3 pm and our room was not ready until 4.30, after 2 complimentary drinks and something to eat which resembled loosely a steak ( i say this as it tasted of burnt something , not wanting to comment on what ) i will not be booking there again in a hurry. Great hotel and great experience. The location is incredible. The rooms are a little small but I’ve heard that’s to be expected in London. The staff are soooo amazing and friendly. They really go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. Karla Siya at front desk and the staff at Haxells are phenomenal! Very excellent service and ambiance.  Our meal was timely and very delicious.  Waiter Amrut was also very professional and attentive-  thank you for a great service.  We will definitely come back again for round 2 and we will also recommend for friends and family to come too. Great location, clean room! Thank you very much for the delicious chocolates. The staff was very helpful too (special mention to Yazdam/Yazdans -sorry I did not catch clearly your name- at the check-out counter). Well, I really appreciate the experience that was stress free Great stay! Thanks Petro and Mohammed for making this trip a very pleasant one. The hotel has very good services and is well located. Great for visiting all the London landmarks. The breakfast is amazing. The rooms are nice and comfortable. A beautifully decorated, welcoming and relaxing hotel. Despite its size, it had a very homely, warm and cosy feel to the hotel which was perfect for a cold January stay as a solo traveller. It felt very safe and comfortable, an excellent location and friendly staff. I only stayed for one night but was very impressed with the hotel lobby, gin bar and the room itself. Lovely touches in the room and a beautiful new bathroom too. Staff were helpful and I was able to leave my bags the next day until I was heading home. Raj gave excellent service, very accommodating. I had the steak and the house wine. Having stayed for a week without the room cleaning service I managed to collect a few green tickets. This meant I could get a ribeye steak and 2 glasses of house red all on the house. Raj was very prompt and friendly and nice company during a solo dinner. I had a great time at Haxells, lovely atmosphere very classy and comfortable, had the salt and pepper calamari as a snack it was really fresh and paired perfectly with a couple drinks. Mostly I’d like to give a shout out to the most attentive staff there is! Super polite really helpful with any questions I  had and thank you to Shivang and the rest of team for keeping me well looked after! Udit was great thank u. Madras was delicious had a great time service was above and beyond! Lovely decor and steak sandwich was thoroughly enjoyed. Wine was also delicious and great prices for what we ordered. Thank you so much Udit!!!!!!!!! We stayed in this hotel on our recent visit to London, so pleased we did. Perfectly located for all the attractions and a stones throw from the theatres.   This hotel has a lovely vibe with friendly and helpful staff. They even put balloons, a card and chocolates in the room to celebrate my daughter's birthday. She was over the moon with this gesture.   The room itself was spacious, modern and well equipped. We stayed in a deluxe studio with a complimentary mini bar and sweet treats, a really nice and welcomed addition to the stay.   Lovely breakfast and great service in the bar. Really couldn't fault a thing. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here if/when we're in London again.  Prior to our stay I had read the reviews about it being a noisy hotel, so I packed eat plugs just in Loved it.  The hotel is right around the corner of the Covent Garden Market and close to some underground stations. I arrived early, but was given a room immediately. The room was nice and clean. When you step out on your floor, there is a sign that shows you the shortest way to your room, how amazing is that? Staff at breakfast are so nice and kind. If you go between 6-8, there will be nearly no other guests eating, so for a calm breakfast you should rise a little earlier, but it’s worth it. Nice selection as well!  The room was very clean and nice and there were some delicious treats waiting for us. We checked in with Hasan, he was extremely polite,friendly and accommodating as well as all the staff. The food was also brilliant! Overall a great place to stay! Very good service and good food! My experience here was very good and thank you so much for everything here. I Will definently visit again and can recommend this place for any one thats visiting London :) I have afternoon tea at the hotel. I miss festival afternoon tea which I come for was I was a bit disappointed. However, Nicoleta is super nice, kind and friendly. Will definitely recommend her and come back again💙  the whole experience was fantastic! professional, polite staff, nothing too much trouble. very appreciative of the upgrade. All staff were extremely customer centric! great location for the westend of London I feel very welcome, kind and polite receprionist ~ Hassan, helpful staff, great location, good value for money. I had pretheatre dinner - excellent service by Raj and the two ladies (Nicoleta and…) from Haxell Restaurant.  Thank you everyone! I had an extremely long travel day and was in need of a drink and snack before bed. Raj did a fantastic job at ensuring that everything was perfect for me. I would highly recommend Raj in addition to the food and drinks. Booked an afternoon tea with the family and we had an amazing experience. Much thanks to the lovel staff especially Andy! Had a good conversation and service from him. Afternoon tea was delicious… :).  Had an amazing stay here for Christmas. It’s very central. Had food in the bar which was very nice. The doorman Paul was lovely and very friendly. The rooms are very spacious & the place is immaculate. Breakfast is Devine & a great selection on offer. Such a nice restaurant located in the Strand Palace Hotel! The food was delicious and the drinks were perfect.  From start to finish my server Nihar  was extremely friendly and professional, full of recommendations. Thank you for a nice experience. I visited strand Palace on the 21st December 2023 approximately 15.30 for an afternoon coffee and snack.The restaurant staff were absolutely fabalous the taste and portion of the food was very generous.I really enjoyed my mocha coffee and as a side snack I shared with my friend we had the mushroom balls,satay chicken,pitta bread with hummus and sun dried tomatoes on top and sweet potatoes Fries it was delicious and filling. A very lovely ambience it was relaxing and I really enjoyed my time! Also I would like to mention the staff waiter Udit he was very attentive and provided excellent service he was absolutely outstanding. I highly recommend and looking forward to my next visit.Its definitely a stop by for me as from now! Thank you for the service and the delicious tasting food Loved the reusable London water bottles and the water coolers on each floor in support of reducing plastic waste . Loved the morning breakfasts everyday - the variety and service is outstanding. Rooms are very small but cleaned well and regularly. Super Central to anything you need in the heart of London! Will definately be back!  Helped by Raj at the strand palace restaurant. He was very kind and gave a very good service. The food was delicious as well. I took a steak with sweet potato fries (my favorite) I would definitely recommend it to eat here. :) My husband and I are staying at the Strand Palace and we decided to do dinner one night in the attached restaurant, which I believe is called Haxells. Shout out to Raj, our server. Food was fine, drinks were good. If you are staying at the hotel, it’s a nice option. Just arrived at the Strand Palace for our 10th wedding anniversary. Had amazing service already from Lara on reception and Monika as well. Thank you for making it a lovely experience and a memorable time.  Excellent hotel that looks well after their guests. Upon arriving at the hotel, we somehow did not have the pre-arranged two connecting rooms allocated to our family reservation (2 adults and 2 kids). Thanks to Dilzal at the reception, we were given upgraded connecting rooms that also have a complimentary mini bar. Great problem solving and excellent customer service! Highly appreciated! The staff at the restaurant and hotel are all super friendly and very attentive. They meet all of your needs. The hotel is located in a very convenient area. We also recommend Isabella and the rest of the restaurant staff. Food was great! Looking forward to returning in the near future and thank you for having us. My husband and I are currently here for New Year’s while we are on our honeymoon. We decided to do the afternoon tea and had a lovely time thanks to Nicoleta! She was so sweet and very helpful with recommendations. Also, she was very accommodating with my shellfish allergy and made sure I was safe. Thanks for making our first English tea so enjoyable! 😊 Very good location, good value for the price. I really liked the idea that the hotel cares about sustainability. I got to refill my water bottles from drinking water tap that is available on each floor. I received a restaurant voucher for each day that I didn’t ask for housekeeping to tidy my room up. On my last day I spent my vouchers on a dinner at the restaurant. The lady in charge of my table named Isabella was super nice and helpful.  I would definitely stay here next time I visit London as well. Mohammed has been amazing and here since 2001 , we loved our stay and would recommend to anyone. The staff are extremely friendly and always take care of you. We will 100% be making a return in the future 🥰🥰🥰🥰 Pefectly located on The Strand in the middle of theatre land. The hotel staff were friendly, helpful and polite. The hotel upgraded our room because it was a special birthday for my wife. It also provided a complimentary mini-bar and a bottle of prosecco - which were greatly appreciately. The breakfast was excellent, and, likewise, for our luchtime dinner in the hotel restaurant. We would definitely stay again Jamitish and Hasan at the Reception were completely fantastic.  They truly excel at customer service and must be commended.  Jamitish could tell I was extremely jet lagged and helped me and Hasan did the same on my departure. The hotel is in great condition, in an ideal neighborhood with great rooms and lovely restaurant.\"},\n",

We arrived early as we were going to the theatre and the staff took our luggage and left it in our room for when we got back. Great location too. Staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay was 5 star. The location is fantastic, as you can read in other reviews. The hotel staff are really nice and helpful. The problem, apart from the street noise in the evening, is that we weren\\'t expecting such a small hotel. Our room was really cramped for the price (£980 for 3 nights). The bedding was good, a little soft for us but that didn\\'t stop us sleeping well. On the other hand, light sleepers will find it very difficult to sleep if their room faces the street. In short, far too expensive for the service we received, and the small size of the premises, coupled with the noise outside, and the very poor soundproofing between rooms, make it hard to believe that this is a 5-star hotel. The team couldn’t have done more to make a birthday very special, decorating the room and setting up well wishes were hugely appreciated! Despite being on the main road in the heart of it all the room itself was very quiet. Great communication leading up to our trip too. This is a five star review not because the Piccadilly London West End is Claridges or the Dorchester, but because the Piccadilly London West End was immaculately kept and, if LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION mean anything to you, the location is amazing.  The hotel is right in the heart of London\\'s West End, three blocks from Piccadilly Circus, one block from Chinatown, and in the heart of Soho with all the wonderful Soho Bars and restaurants in the blocks  DIRECTLY behind the hotel, along with West End Theatres.  Furthermore, the price was great (via Expedia) and although the  room I selected was very small (which I knew going in so I\\'m not complaining about it), but despite being a small room every surface in the room was new, clean, and even the carpet was new.  The hotel is very I don\\'t usually like to give negative reviews bit I felt this hotel badly let me and my wife down this weekend. Firstly the room was so small we had no space to put our small suitcases. It was like a box room. The bed was the smallest double bed I have ever stayed ans I have stayed at alot of hotels. My wife is a size 8 and im not a big guy either and it was like sharing a slightly bigger single bed. Absolutely ridiculous   We booked a economy double (room 504) not expecting miracles but just the basics but for the price poor value for money.  Finally the rooms  ARE NOT sound proof! So forget sleeping all we could hear was police sirens and car alarms going off all night. We didnt get a wink of sleep and was tempted to check out earlier. I mean surely its common sense to have Very comfortable rooms.  Very clean.  Very attentive staff.  The slight downsides for us were that the bar area is cramped and the restaurant is more of a cafe style.  However given the phenomenal location these aren\\'t big issues given the number and quality of eating and drinking places nearby On a positive note the hotel is in a great location and staff are very friendly and helpful.  The room we were given was the smallest hotel room I have ever seen.  I think it was previously a storage cupboard.  The bed was a three quarter bed and not really suitable for 2 quests. It was £330 for the night and I was not impressed.  I did complain to the reception staff but was told the hotel was full and so we couldn\\'t be moved.  Breakfast was lovely too. I just don\\'t think that room is suitable for 2 people  This was our second time at this hotel and we returned as it is very central and very handy to get about London  The rooms are great and we had a corner room which was even more spacious with everything in the room which was needed Bathroom was great with great shower and plenty of fluffy towels  Breakfast was great with plenty choice and staff were very helpful  The little extra touches in the room were a lovely gesture by the staff from rose petals on bed balloon towels decoration and bottle of Prosecco and cheesecake - really appreciated the gesture  Staff at front desk were very helpful and left luggage when checking out and returned when leaving London  I would highly recommend this hotel and will return again  We stayed at The Piccadilly for our special anniversary & theatre trip. We got such a warm welcome by the very friendly staff & even given a mulled wine. Harun was so friendly and showed us up to our room. We were shocked to enter such a beautiful room with 4 poster bed, a heart made out of towels & rose petals. There was a bottle of prosecco chilling & strawberries dipped in chocolate! The room was lovely, spacious, nice bathroom, great shower. There was complimentary fruit & bottled water & tea & coffee facilities, nice coffee machine. There\\'s a mini bar with nice selection & snacks, reasonably priced. On leaving or returning all the staff were so friendly especially Harun, Doina & Slav. We had a very nice breakfast, great selection. The only one downside is the noise from the Very welcoming staff and the room was very comfortable with everything you need for a good night. Reasonably stocked mini bar, Nice bowl of fruit and bottled water supplied. Lovely Indian Restaurant in the hotel. Good buffet breakfast. The only thing missing is a bar. We returned to the hotel at 10.30 and the restaurant which also acts as the bar was closed. Everything about our stay was fantastic and the hotel staff went out of their way to make us feel very welcome and special. I had booked the room due to its proximity to the theatre but also as we were celebrating a special birthday for my partner who had just turned 50 in the week.  When we arrived at check in we were treated to some lovely mulled wine, which was very welcome given how cold it was outside. We were checked in very quickly and after a short wait we were shown to our room where we had a lovely surprise as the Hotel had gone out of their way to dress the bed and gift us a bottle of Prosecco as a presenter to my partner, what a lovely touch and completely unexpected!  The room had everything we needed and was extremely comfortable with super soft bedding and a A perfect weekend London getaway for myself and my daughter.  What makes this hotel stand apart is the front of house staff.  From the moment you walk in the door you are made so welcome.   From a courtesy hot chocolate  to the smiles and welcoming comments from the reception staff just made things so nice.   Personally shown to our room and a guided tour around it.   5 star for customer service.   Topped off with the most comfortable beds and all in all a great stay Exceptional service. Rooms very clean and comfortable and very good variety at breakfast. Doina, Tatum and Aura very helpful and friendly and made us feel very welcome. Can\\'t wait to return on Dec 16th for a long weekend. Our stay was lovely, from the room to the spa, the breakfast and the staff. I would like to thank you all for making our stay a fantastic stay in London. The location is awesome, right in the heart of SoHo. Maybe not a lot of tables to have breakfast, but that’s a little issue. We had a couple of nights in London for our 20th wedding anniversary and picked this hotel as a treat. We were not disappointed. It was a great location for all we wanted to do and the staff were all excellent. We mentioned it was our anniversary when we dropped our luggage off (a very useful feature) and when we arrived at our room later the staff had kindly laid on some extras for us which made our stay even more special. Very nice breakfast too. The hotel is lovely, and the staff are lovely, especially the receptionists. The beds are comfy and the heated floors add the little bit extra. Breakfast is very nice and it’s a buffet style with hot and cold food. However, I would not rate this a 5* for some very small reasons: 1. When we got there, there was no shampoo or shower gel. We had to ask at reception but you would think with it being a new customer this would be checked.  2. The Wi-Fi is shocking. I had better Wi-Fi on some of the underground’s. 3. We stayed in room 103 and there is music from the souvenir shock downstairs until 10:00 like literally vibrating the floor. And you can hear every single thing outside and in the corridor.  I would personally stay again as long as I could request a room on a higher floor. Our stay here was absolutely amazing. From start to finish, the staff where incredible and very friendly, area was perfect and even though it was busy the room was quiet at night. Spotlessly clean and a lovely spacious room. I will definitely be back!  My wife & I are 68 and 65 year old Americans. We stayed in a Club Room with Continental Breakfast for 6 nights. We enjoyed our stay in the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good quality with choices of eggs, meats, cereals, fruit, bread/pastries. Our room was ready early which allowed for check-in several hours in advance of the stated 2pm check-in. There was a fruit basket and complimentary bottled water in the room. The hotel is centrally located allowing you to walk to many locations (theater, shopping, British Museum, Trafalgar Square, National Gallery, etc.) The closest that I have to a complaint is that there is no grab bar in the shower. It was a very big step in and out of the tub to bathe. My wife (5\\'2\") and I (5\\'10\") both had to hold onto The absolute perfect location for London theatres in Soho and for so many main visitor attractions in Piccadilly, Covent Garden and more. The staff were so welcoming and attentive and the deluxe room we booked was perfect. It was my wife\\'s birthday during our two night stay and the hotel left cake and a bottle of prosecco for us both which was a lovely gesture along with rose petals on the bed. We would definitely stay at the Piccadilly London West End again and recommend it thoroughly. Great hotel. Stunning interior and decorations. Lovely service and very attentive staff! Made my 60th birthday weekend very special! Doina, Daniela and Aula were great - thank you! We will definitely return.  My husband and I stayed over for 1 night on the 20th Nov. The hotel was perfectly located for our theatre night. The hotel was immaculate, the staff were very attentive and we were treated very well. I cannot praise them highly enough. Would highly recommend this hotel and will stay there  on our next trip to London. Special thanks to Daniela Absolutely phenomenal hotel! Great location, service and everything. Karthik was incredibly helpful throughout our stay. He gave us excellent service and recommendations. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in the Piccadilly area. Superb hotel as always. Great welcome from staff especially Slav and Daniela at reception. Bedroom very well appointed, spotlessly clean. Thank you for the complimentary wine. We have been coming here for several years and do not intend staying anywhere else. The staff are extremely obliging and friendly.   Great location close to  Chinatown and theatres. Room was very comfortable and set up with 2 double beds. When we asked for help with the phone maintenance arrived within 5 minutes and sorted the problem.  I cannot fault this hotel, clean, comfortable, the location is perfect for theatre, the breakfast is delicious (and feels more like a coffee shop than a hotel breakfast room, you know how some hotels can feel like a canteen), but the best thing about it is the staff and the service they provide.  From all the team smiles that greeted us on check in (and refreshments), to Sai taking us up to the room for the surprise decorations, sweet treats and fizz for my birthday, every time we came and went we knew nothing was too much trouble. Will definitely stay here again. I stayed here for 3 nights and the location is heaven. Right in SoHo, London High Street; the shopping, theater and fine dining district. Check in was a breeze. Staff are friendly and courteous.   However, for the price of my room which was over £300 a night I was expecting a big room. My room was compact, big enough for just one person. The room is clean and modern and stocked with everything a guest may need. The bathroom was tiny and the shower pressure was low.  There is a small nice restaurant on the property that offer very tasty Indian cuisine if you are a fan. If not, there are tons of options in the area.   The Piccadilly underground is a walk away and Oxford Circle station is further away but walkable. Regent street is about 3 minutes walk from the hotel.   Overall I This is an excellent hotel in a brilliant location. The staff are completely focused on their guests and deliver exceptional service from the moment you walk through the door. The rooms are well furnished and maintained to a very high standard. The hotel is very clean and comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel. This hotel and its staff are amazing. We landed way ahead of our check in and the staff couldn\\'t\\'ve done enough to facilitate our every need. Each and everyone of the staff were excellent and could not be more helpful. Our rooms were spotless and the the bed and pillows were so comfortable. I only stayed one night for business but look forward to returning with my wife someday to this one. I stay in a lot of hotels and seldom say this. We have some lite bites in the bar and they were excellent. I look forward to my return to this little gem. We stayed in The Picadilly to be close to the show venue and for my accessibility needs. These needs were absolutely met. The staff were very accommodating and as soon as they saw me, they got the ramps out straight away to allow quick access to the building. The room was very clean, comfortable and had everything we needed, including a couple of extras. On top of this, I was left a gift and card got my birthday.  Overall, a great hotel and the staff were fantastic.  The breakfast is also great We have just got back from a wonderful stay at this hotel. Staff were so friendly and helpful, went the extra mile to make sure my mum had a lovely birthday. Hotel was in a great location and room was lovely. Will definitely be visiting again on our next trip to London We were delighted with the surprise celebration gifts & how the room was set up for us, it was a brilliant way to start the minibreak. Everything was great, a very comfortable bed, lovely spacious room & bathroom, fantastic facilities & excellent location.  The staff were the most attentive & helpful hotel staff, always on hand to assist us. Such a fantastic stay, the hotel is a real gem.  Thank you Daniela & Team for making our stay so wonderful This was a great little find for us. I wasn’t expecting the standard of service and comfort as we found. From the pre stay welcome emails checking if there was anything we needed, to the welcome at reception and the great room we stayed in, all made for a pleasant stay. This is now our London hotel of choice. Thanks to all for a lovely visit. Excellent location.  Fantastic and friendly staff who were very helpful.  Perfect for China Town, Covent Garden and generally mooching round London.  Good sized rooms and comfortable beds with great amenities.  Very quiet despite the location. Stayed at this lovely hotel for our anniversary. Our room was upgraded and also the room was decorated with harts and Anniversary balloons a bottle of Prosecco and chocolate strawberry’s it was lovely they really made a big effort to make our stay extra special and memorable. The hotel is spotless clean and comfortable. Breakfast is good and there’s plenty of Choice . The hotel is situated perfectly in the hart of the west end so minutes from all the shows and restaurants and bars and china town. I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely return when staying in London .  Thanks to all the staff who are very helpful and welcoming and special thanks to Daniela for the room 🙂. The hotel is well located in The West End where China Town meets Soho, perfect for our stay. Really helpful and friendly reception team.  Spacious, clean rooms, nice to find a bath in a London hotel, really comfy bed. Good amenities that includes a Nespresso machine. Will stay here again. Absolutely brilliant staff, aura, doina, daniellla, slave   Was Absolutely brilliant and accomaditing. Great location and amazing customer service.  I recommend this hotel and definitely will stay here again.    Great stay, great room, great location. Perfect for a city trip , hotel located close to everything.  Thanks to Tatum, Bianca and Slav for the stay  and service !  And the breakfast is really worth it !  Highly recommend this hotel, they made our stay very special. It was my Mum\\'s birthday trip, we had a show to see and the hotel was ideally located. All of the staff (including Doina, Aura & Sai) were fantastic, very friendly and helpful. They made our stay extra special with some lovely touches and it really made our weekend memorable. The room was great and the breakfast was excellent. We\\'ll be back! Following some confusion with our booking, Doina was able to rectify this quickly and ensure that we had the best time. We went for our 20th wedding anniversary and were given a decorated four poster room with Prosecco and strawberries. It was wonderful. We could look out of the bedroom window and see theatres and Chinatown within 200m either way. Hotel restaurant quite small for breakfast but it was very tasty and plentiful.  Staff were all so friendly and couldn’t do enough for you. Some noise at night but you are in the heart of London. We would definitely recommend staying here and would return in the future.'},\n",

We were greeted by a lovely receptionist who went over and beyond to ensure our stay was extra special. Our room was upgraded upon arrival which was a great surprise. Would definitely recommend ! We spent 7 days at The Gate in August 2022, and we enjoyed every minute of it. Here are 5 reasons you should go for The Gate if you are searching for modern, comfort, convenience and service.  a.\\tModern feel. The building is very nice, very modern and very clean. It makes living in the apartments and the common areas a very comfortable experience, all the time. Spotless all the time.   b.\\tService. I found it very nice and convenient to be offered complementary coffee every morning at the breakfast area on Floor 5. Nice touch.  c.\\tFriendly staff. We were very impressed the staff, specifically with Gabriella who helped us throughout our stay with all sorts of questions: restaurants, attractions, markets, parking lots, etc. When we checked in, we reported an issue with the AC The building is beautiful and modern.The service was great.Thank you to Vicente,Mohammad and Stefania We were happy that we could you the lounge every time we want .Lovely and clean room .A lot of off options to choose around the area The hotel is a very solid choice for this area and any issues were minor.  Close to multiple subway and bus lines, you can get to any spot in London easily.   Lots of nice eateries walking distance (try Fanzi next door, or Amber).  Very quiet area at night.  The rooms and suites and one bedroom apartments are all extremely small, surprising for a newer structure in London but very clean.   The sofa bed is very comfortable.   Be aware there are no king size beds, just doubles, so plan accordingly.  Staff were very nice, kudos to Vincent especially who was highly professional and went above and beyond to help.   Unfortunately we spoke to other staff who did not know how to adjust the thermostats (press thr right side button of three unmarked buttons, then set temp wheel) and we Our stay in The Gate Hotel London is going great! But thanks to Mohammad, Vincent, Reneta and Lutfur it’s going wonderfully.  We had a little inconvenience do to our own mistake, but Mohammad saved our vacation. Thanks to his generosity and kindness we are having a wonderful time. This is our second day of our 6 day stay and we couldn’t be happier. The building is very nice, very modern and clean. Friendly staff that will help with any questions or concerns. So far a wonderful experience at The Gate and would not hesitate to recommend it. 5 stars for sure!   This was our last stop before heading home to Australia for three nights. We stayed at the Wilde Apartments just down the street at the beginning of the trip but in the interests of market research booked this on the way out.  This place is modern just like the Wilde but our experience was different.  The address may be White Chapel Lane but its on the corner of a busy road just like the Wilde. We love the East end of London with its vibe and energy but we like a good nights sleep.  We had booked several months out and requested a quiet room but got allocated one on a lower floor facing the A13. Despite being touted for long stays this was just a hotel room with a small kitchenette, no table and chairs for dining.  We asked for another room and got a nice corner accessible one it claims to be 5 * for this it would be cheap and the location is super it’s a 3 star superior or 4 star nice rooms but small with kitchenette no service for towels etc - this would be good  if you knew otherwise your pull your wet towels out of the shower tray and use again lounge in 5 th floor is good but you don’t know where to find stuff etc cleanliness is good  personell friendly so not advertised fully correctly price for 3 star plus at location on higher side  location top Group of 10 ladies had an overnight here for a friends' birthday. The service was excellent; rooms a decent size; quality bedding although double beds are slightly on the small size. Clean and very good customer service with complementary tea, coffee and a small mini bar also complimentary. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend.  I recently stayed at The Gate for my partners birthday and it did not disappoint. After booking, I reached out to the hotel to see if they were able to offer any complimentary upgrades to make our stay extra special. Jamal who took care of my request via email was incredibly kind and helpful and ensured that a note was made on our reservation to fulfil our requirements subject to availability.   We arrived at the hotel (earlier than our check in time) and were greeted with the lovely Gabriela who was so friendly and bubbly. She allowed us to check in earlier than usual and upgraded us to a high level room which had a beautiful view of the city and even a pint on the house for the birthday boy!   The rooms were beautifully decorated, quite unique bathrooms and had a very Nice room, comfortable and quiet and well appointed with modern facilities and bathroom. Well located and I would recommend staying here. The front of house staff were very helpful. Thanks a lot for helping us with our stay. Friendly staff, accommodated very well. Followed instructions. Muhammad was very helpful and kind. Hotel was perfect. Very nice room and clean and tidy. Pricey but definitely worth the stay. Will definitely be staying here again. Stayed here recently with my Girlfriend, and we had a perfect stay. room was lovely and the staff were attentive and friendly, Specifically Mohammad, Vincent and Gabi. Thanks guys - Really recommend :) Amazing stay at The Gate for my boyfriends birthday. Mohammad was so accommodating and made our experience so enjoyable. We stayed in the penthouse and the views were beautiful and the bed was super comfortable.  Friendly and helpful staff , who recommended a couple of local restaurants to try, cosy and comfy room , lovely lounge area open 24 / 7 to relax and have free juice or coffee. Excellent buffet breakfast, that was also great value for money. Great location  Highly recommend, would definitely stay here again Highly recommend Nice room with nice shampoo and body wash. Nice view too if stay at higher floors. The nearby streets do not feel that safe at night and nearest train station only have stairs. Walkable distance to fast food and supermarkets.  Minor inconvenience: Doesn't have daily housekeeping and only throw rubbish and refresh towels every 4th day. We stayed at The Gate due to its fantastic location, and when we got there it was absolutely the case. We performed the early check-in prior to arrival but when we arrived it wasn't clear how to then scan the QR code provided in the email so we ended up manually checking-in which made the online check-in somewhat pointless.   We paid £451 for two nights including breakfast, in one of the studio apartments; compared to other hotels I’ve stayed in for similar prices, in London, I felt the room left a lot to be desired. It was clean and tidy but the room itself was showing signs of age with chips and chunks taken from the wall, the carpet looking well trodden, I just expected more for the price.   The kitchen was well equipped with what you would need to keep yourself going and Excellent hotel.Elegant and modern apartaments.Well Located closed to the underground station. I would like to say thank you to Vicente,Mohammad,Stefania and Gosia. They were really polite and friendly  Beautiful decoration.Lovely smell. Vicente and Stefania are reslly great host. I loved Le Labo toiletries. The hotel is good located and a walking distsnce to Brick Lane and Liverpool street station. I would recommend to.book a Skyline apartment and have amazing views. Such a reasonably priced hotel! Absolutely lovely lobby with a quick check in. A room on the 18th floor so pretty cool view, tv with sound bar. Stocked kitchenette and a great-sized shower.  The only downside was we had a connecting room with someone else, and we could hear their tv through it, as well as the odd cough. Made me a little uncomfortable with it being so close, but honestly for such a reasonable price this hotel is well worth it. Good facilities, comfortable and cozy with excelent views and well connected with public transport. Very good customer service, especially from Vicente, who answered all our questions and provided excelent service. So close to so much. Out the door to the left. Efes for amazing Turkish food. Grounded for breakfast. Great curry down bricklane.  To the right pizza or pasta at Amelia’s.  So close to the underground to get anywhere.  Short walk to the Tower of London and tower bridge or one stop on tube. Great market across the street.  Love the staff. Loved it all An excellent place to stay .very good efficient staff and excellent check in process by Mr Mohamed & Mr Vincent.   The hotel is very clean and well maintained. The best location and hundreds of restaurants around . Love to come back and stay here. Very good for long term stays and very accommodative for long term rates. The team at Flavour Venues & Events recently had the pleasure of staying at The Gate Hotel. This luxury aparthotel exceeded our expectations and provided us with a quiet and very comfortable stay in a bustling part of the City. This Aldgate based hotel has excellent transport links and is walking distance from City business hubs, plus popular locations such as Tower Bridge, Brick Lane, and Shoreditch. Despite its busy location, The Gate provides an atmosphere of serenity, plus a very warm welcome. The Gate Hotel London boasts a strong collection of 189 apartment bedrooms. Our Superior Apartment had excellent soundproofing and offered fabulous views of the surrounding area. The design of the room made fantastic use of the space, comfortably including a bathroom, kitchen, dining I stayed in this hotel for more than 8 months. The room was wonderful, and the people very nice. The room was equipped with a kitchen, washing machine, dishing machine and two TVs. I had a really nice stay. Really amazing hotel. It was my friends birthday weekend and we got upgraded to a suite which was a lovely surprise. Mohammad was very welcoming and helpful on the front desk - very informative and friendly!  Have stayed in London 3 times over the past few years, but this was the first  time to stay at The Gate, first time in the East End.  I was there with my son, daughter, grandson and his wife for 5 nights at the end of September 2023. We had a terrific time because: Rooms were very comfortable - good sleeping every night, we appreciated the kitchenette facilities - dishwasher, basic dishes, glasses and table service, clothes washer/dryer unit and fridge.  The 5th floor lounge was a big plus -  complimentary coffee and flavored water available all day and evening, very reasonably priced and good quality Continental breakfasts every morning ( hot breakfasts also available, but we were fine without), comfy furniture and lots of windows for the times we just wanted to sit all I love staying at the gate. The staff are always so nice. Gabriele and her team always welcome me back with a smile and warm welcome. The rooms are so much better than a hotel. And the 5th floor lounge is so convenient especially staying with colleagues as a place to hang out and not be in the lobby or each others rooms.  I like the gym  had all the basics - perhaps a bit small. Over 6 people is tight but usually a mix of people doing cardio vs resistance training. Convenient to liverpool street station and walks across tower bridge and the south bank. The room had excellent amenities and a fabulous view. The staff Mohammad, Stefanie and Renata were very helpful and took care of everything. The space is very modern and the bed was comfortable, although would be great to have option of non feather pillows and covers for those with allergies. Location is close to station and also supermarket and several restaurants. Would stay here again.  What a treat to stay at The Gate for a business trip! The room is spacious and comfortable, I especially like that there is a lot of storage in the shower room. The lounge in the fifth floor is a modern and relaxing place to gather before or after dinner. We stayed at The Gate for 2 nights earlier this week and thoroughly enjoyed our time there.  Our room was very well equipped and the bed very comfy.  We also thought the 5th floor lounge was a nice touch and, as well as having breakfast there, we used it to get a cup of coffee when we returned to the hotel in the evening.  Special mention must also go to Gabriella and Mohamad who were so helpful in giving us directions to the various places we were visiting. Stayed here for a couple for weeks. The location is great for getting around London. The studio I’ve stayed in had everything I needed and was kept very clean. The staff was nice and helpful, most notably Stefanie, Vicente and Yozlem. I would like to thank all of the Gate's staff for truly making my stay truly unforgettable, especially Stefania and Vicente that welcome me upon check-in. My room was spacious and clean, and the mattress was very comfortable. The hotel is located couple of minutes walk from the tube and they also have a small selection of salads and burgers for dinner. I'll be back! I was very happy in my stay, everything was clean very quiet place, I slept very good, also high speed Wi-Fi . Nice view in my room everything around you restaurants and supper market. And the important thing the staff all of them friendly and helpful especially Mohammad with lovely smile and welcoming.    I  have been staying at the Gate since April 2023 and I'm here for 6 months. I thought of taking some time to reflect on my experience during my last month here for the benefit of others considering this place for a medium to long-term stay.  In summary, I recommend The Gate for their rooms, the amenities, and the people!  The people ---> Everyone from the front desk staff to the room service crew are friendly, professional, and always willing to help. Special shout-out to Vicente and Mohammed. Since my very first day here in April, Vicente has always greeted me with a smile and stopped to ask how I was doing, no matter if I was in a rush or if he was tied up with guests. He has always been available to help with anything I needed, and throughout my time here he kindly helped me Amazing experience, great apartment! Comfortable bed and absolutely gorgeous view. Air conditioning helped a lot during heatwave in London. Staff was really helpful and very friendly. We booked again following our stay and will be back more.  Friendly & welcoming staff. Modern & well maintained hotel with lovely interior. We stayed in a lovely studio apartment. Comfy bed. Room was very clean & well equipped with a city view. Would recommend.  Had to book a last minute room after missing our Eurostar (now we know to be there at least an hour before departure!). Vicente and Mohammed at the front desk did an amazing job at accommodating us and had our room ready only an hour after we booked. We had a great time at the Gate Hotel, the facilities are great and the staff is amazing, specially Stefania. The area where the hotel is located is perfect and close to the universities . The lounge on the 5th floor is great to gran a cup of coffee or get work done. Thanks for the great stay! The Gate London Hotel provides a memorable and comfortable stay in the heart of London. The impeccable service, stylish accommodations, and excellent dining options make it a top choice for travelers looking to experience the best of the city. I would gladly return for another stay and highly recommend it to fellow travelers. During my recent stay at The Gate London Hotel, I had the privilege of interacting with Mohammad at the reception, and I must say his exceptional service left a lasting impression.  My wife and I and our son had a wonderful stay at The Gate. We stayed in The Residence which had two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a kitchenette. There was also a combination washer/dryer which was a great convenience. The space was roomy and well appointed. It was very clean. The staff were wonderful and responsive to our every need. There is a small grocery store right across the street so we were able to get food for breakfast and snacks. One small drawback was given the fact that they don't service the room every day we had to find places to hang our towels to dry which was a bit of a challenge. Also the combo washer dryer is a mystery to us Canadians but the maintenance staff kindly gave us a crash course in its use. Because the hotel is a bit off the tourist track (but there\"},\n",

Very close to train stations. Easy commute to city center. The location was very good, 5 minutes walk to North Acton subway station, there were many supermarkets nearby.

Bugs (bit of filler and filled by maintenance), blockage in shower and sink (cleared eventually after some interestingassumptions!) Myself and the GM spoke about the problems but unfortunately he didn\\'t like me, and was very abrupt and aggressive towards me Lovely stay here for 2 weeks. Restaurant meals were amazing, staff friendly, and accommodating. Bed was comfortable. Easy access to the Underground Subway and other public Transport. Laundry service available. Westfield London 2 train stops away! We had the upgraded executive room and it was really nice and spacious and modern.   I wish they had normal milk instead of long life with the tea and coffee facilities, and in the lovely bathroom they supply the cheapo \\'Dove\\' products which is a downgrade what I normally expect at Holiday inns.   The breakfast was delicious and the reception area very nice.  Highly recommend  Have not stayed at this hotel, I visit the bar and lounge regularly as i work in the area, the staff are friendly polite and very professional although they are regularly understaffed. My gripe is obviously regarding the bar area there are so many flies constantly in your glass on the counter I am constantly brushing flies away from my food and drink. They do not have sufficient glasses for the beers they sell ie lager in a guiness glass ale in a larger glass etc on so many occasions no limes or lemons no straws no napkins. Proof reading the above seems that I\\'m just whining but when you consider the costs. I would suggest if the manager/management monitor these reviews they will try to address these issues.Have not stayed at this hotel, I visit the bar and lounge regularly as i Front Desk personnel are extremely helpful and made our stay more enjoyable. Always willing to answer our questions and help in any way possible. Their orientation helped our trips to the City of London much more possible. Excellent  management,  excellent stay  A very big thank you to Martin for keeping our reservation till 1 :30 am, after our flight was canceled at Heathrow airport. I had my elderly mom with me and after  waiting for  a taxi  for over an hour at the airport to take us to the hotel, we were all so exhausted but management at the hotel was excellent and we had a excellent stay  Thank you Martin  My son stayed with you on Monday night with his school, upon arrival home daft child realised he\\'d left his coat in the hotel!!  I got hold of the email address from teachers and got in contact...................  Fab staff member called Sarah was tasked with hunting for it and so I arranged for DHL to collect. Its just arrived back here in not so sunny Wales.  Thank you 😊 I rated my experience 4/5 times he staff was helpful and coporative especially Noman joseph he helped a lot and he was really good and caring the hotel was in a quiet place there was a train station with the hotel and the view of the front side was amazing We stayed for three nights and had a lovely time. The staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and the bar and restaurant is great. It’s also within walking distance to North Acton station making it a great location when staying in London.  We stayed here in holiday inn west London for 4 days the service was good and the staff was corporative especially Nouman Joseph, he helped us a lot and was very friendly . I would recommend this hotel as it near to the centre and the airport as well. The subway station is also on walking distance  The stay is very clean and its central line to soho area is around 30 minutes. Breakfast is great with excellent service from Nouman Joseph. Highly recommend for travellers looking for a clean and good night’s sleep Stayed in HI West for a week for work. The hotel is very conveniently located between North Acton station of Central Line and Acton Main Line station of Elizabeth line (quick Heathrow connect). Front desk stuff professional and polite. Room (premium king) was great. Large for London standards with a great fluffy bed and all the basics you may need during your stay. Breakfast was ok, nothing extraordinary, but ok. Had dinner in the hotel restaurant once, and that experience was not very nice. Food was late and payment experience horrible. First they couldn\\'t put the bill on the room, despite asking for a room number and my card wouldn\\'t be accepted despite the fact that the waiter confirmed that AMEX is good to go. Unproffessional from start to finish.  Other than that I would Great place to stay for our London trip, 3 blocks to the north Acton tube station, and quickly into London. Very helpful and friendly desk staff as older couple asking questions and needing advice, excellent breakfast buffet.   The stay was wonderful. Room was clean and tidy. Breakfast was very good. The train station was 5 min walk from the hotel. The staff was very helpful. They provided a place to keep the luggage. They also provided us the room an hour early check in.  This hotel is really good! I sincerely recommend to everyone. I came down for work meetings with a few mates and we enjoyed our stay thoroughly.   The food in the evening was amazing. The Capao stir fry is a must try. We were served by Abinaya and she showed excellent customer service, she was constantly smiling and made sure to ask if we were happy with our meals. The staff in the evening are very hard working.  Husrev in reception was also very helpful in checking and checking us out. Made sure that we were all satisfied with our stay. Will definitely stay again. See you soon.  I arrived at this hotel with no booking having been let down massively by booking.com.  The reception staff were fantastic and did all that they could to get me the best rate and give me the best experience. Very helpful in a world where no one helps anymore.  We then went to the bar for a few hours and the Bar Tender was excellent.   Really impressed and 10/10 would recommend. The hotel is placed perfectly for visits into central London. It’s well kept and clean, the food is good and priced sensibly. Having said all that the reason this hotel is different from others is the staff. I don’t know how the team is put together but they always have such genuine kind staff who do really care about the customers. I stay a lot for business and I have dinner in the hotel and both Roshani and Linoshka especially are so helpful and cheerful as all the staff are. All the staff I meet are always smart, polite, and always enquire how you are and make you feel welcome. A Holiday Inn is a Holiday Inn and you know what you get... which is reassuring when traveling in Europe.  A clean / comfortable room at a reasonable price.  The Holiday Inn West in Acton (a western suburb of London) is a cut above most Holiday Inns - it has a restaurant and a bar.  The staff was gracious and very helpful.  The only downside is it is approx 20-25 minutes from the tourist sites in London... could be longer depending on traffic.  My daughter and I stayed here for a couple of nights. The room was lovely and had plenty of room. The beds were comfortable and there was no noise from the main road right outside. Everything was clean and tidy. The shower was good too. Check-in took a while as there was a big queue, not enough staff on duty. But those that were there were very friendly and helpful, especially with advice about the car park and how to find the nearest tube. Violeta made our breakfast - polite, helpful and kind. Nothing was too much trouble.  Thank you Violeta - if we come back it will be because of you (Elliot aged 7 agrees!)  The rooms whilst basic were fine for a 2 night stay, the roof terrace was somewhere quiet to escape to for a little while out of the room and bar Room 616 was tired and had holes in the curtains. You cannot open the window at all and the air con is poor. The extraction in the bathroom is inadequate leading to a very stuffy environment. There is a very odd smell on the landing on the 6th floor, chemical/possibly electrical. We asked for a fan and were told it would be brought to our room but it never was. We weren’t asked if we had a pleasant stay at check out, nor thanked for visiting- seems like a small thing but the when the standard pleasantries are missed it’s quite jarring. Close to the North Acton Station on the Central line ideal location to be out of the city but great links to the city.  Met upon arrival complimentary upgrade room was spacious bed was comfy and no complaints I could see the Wembley arch in the distance from my room.  Breakfast was good not great full English again good Limited on choice, but was sufficient to set you up for the day.  I also ate there one evening service was prompt food was good.    On a clear evening please stop off at the roof terrace on floor 4 from there you will be able to see the Wembley arch, the London Eye and other landmarks.  I\\'d happily stay here again, thank you for being welcoming  The Hotel is well connected to the center by the subway. The rooms are normal, the same as the buffet-style breakfast, they could improve the soundproofing, especially in our room, which was next to the stairs. Special thanks to Pablo breakfast staff always attentive, efficient and fast I\\'m so disappointed with the experience I had during my recent stay at the Holiday Inn London West Hotel. Upon checking in, I was faced with an unexpected and unjust parking charges notice, which has left me feeling frustrated and disheartened.   During my check-in process, I informed the receptionist that I had parked my car in the hotel car park and was in the process of moving the luggages from the car park to the reception. At no point was I advised of any parking fees  that may be applicable during the check in period, nor was I informed of any potential penalties that may arise from parking in the hotel car park.   Despite this, I have now received a penalty notice for GBP 100 plus GBP55 administration fee from the car rental company which the administration charge has Good location, a few minutes from the subway, easy to get to.  Sanam was very helpful and friendly upon check in, she signed us up for the breakfast buffet which was good quality. Room was clean and wifi was easy to join This hotel is convenient and handy because it is in a good location with ease of access to North Acton Underground station. Parking is easy if you arrive  early. But if you’re coming a bit later, spaces may be hard to come by. In that event, I’ve discovered they’re not fussy about not allowing one to use a disabled space, or even permitting parking where there is no marked space. Every thing is acceptable so long as you pay in advance, at check in, £18 per night.   Check in at reception was a breeze. There’s nothing special about their so called Executive Rooms, which are fairly basic.  These are located on the 7th floor or form a separate wing on each of the other floors.   Having checked in,after taking my bag upstairs I thought I could grab a bite in the restaurant before A very very standard hotel. Almost a Holiday Express \"Plus\". Rooms clean and tidy but the decor is a light blue cold feeling with wooden floors and no carpets. Breakfast is not great for a holiday inn. Bar facility ok but overpriced. The location is ok with access to transportation. Ideal fir a visit to the Algerian embassy.  Came here for one night for work.  Very nice new hotel, only a few minutes from Acton North tube station.  Room was clean and high above the traffic so no noise.  There is a McDonalds opposite.  The hotel breakfast was very good, with plenty of room to sit and relax with a coffee and cereal. We experienced the best possible customer service during our stay. Tabhi Sandhu went above and beyond to coordinate with us prior to our arrival from over seas then ensured we were taken care of upon our family’s arrival to the hotel. He also threw in free breakfast due to some delays and hiccups with our initial room reservation.  Tabhi, thanks again. I had a great stay and the food was exceptional in my recent experience of hotel stays. On top of that the staff were very polite and accommodating; and Linoska stood out in particular. Thank you, see you again soon Often cheaper than the Holiday Inn Express around the corner this is a great base if you\\'re working in central or west London and you need a fast getaway to the M1, M40 or M4. The team here are consistently helpful and professional, and although some of the rooms are beginning to look a little tired they are lovely and clean. Special mentions to Kais on the front desk who helped me with my complicated admin requirements the other day and Hasti who goes out of her way to make you feel at home. The Hotel is wonderful and the staff are amazing!  Tomas K. at the front desk will do all that he can to make your stay all that you hoped it would be.  The breakfast in the restaurant is delicious, but what makes it even better is the warm welcome and sweet smile you receive from Miss Violeta-who is part of the Breakfast Team- each morning as you come to breakfast!  She made us feel very welcome!    We appreciate the staff at this hotel and I highly recommend this hotel if you stay London!  It is close to  public transportation as well which is a bonus!!  Clean, well priced based for exploring London. Close to tube (7or 8 stops to central London) and train line from Heathrow. Located in a commercial area - no restaurants or shops nearby - fast food stores in walking distance. All staff from cleaning, front desk and restaurant were friendly and cheerful. Hotel messed up my reservation, but admitted fault and fixed it. Mini-gym with a view on the top floor for a basic workout - weight plates but no bar to put them on. Aloha- I am so eager to write these reviews for two employees on our first day here at Holiday Inn. Monica at the front desk and Mohammed at the restaurant.  For Monica- this front desk employee consistently displayed a high level of professionalism, attentiveness, and genuine care for the guests from our first day. She had an impressive ability to multitask efficiently, ensuring that everyone’s needs were met promptly and with a smile. What truly impressed me was their exceptional problem-solving skills. On one occasion, I encountered an issue with my room, and she promptly resolved it, ensuring ourcomfort and satisfaction. Her proactive approach in anticipating and addressing potential challenges demonstrated their commitment to ensuring a pleasant stay for each guest.  For The staff is amazing. Breakfast was good, and there were lots of choices to eat. Violeta was serving us, and we got a  💯 per cent of her attention. She was so helpful and lovely. Her smile made our day. Highly recommended this hotel. Can\\'t wait to get back.  My mom and I stayed a week for a birthday trip. We’ll go elsewhere next time. The front desk told us the wrong tube stop from Heathrow and we had to drag our luggage a mile and a half through the industrial district 👎🏼 Breakfast is not included and you get powdered instant coffee in the room 😬 I booked a room with *two* beds 3 months in advance and upon arrival they had a room ready for us with *one* bed. We asked at the desk for two beds. They gave us our room keys which brought us to…a room with one bed. I called the front desk and was told that the sofa was a sleeper sofa! For the amount of money I paid in full up front, no I would not be sleeping on a pull-out couch for a week. So after two days of arguing they finally moved us to a room with two beds. We considered The location is perfect...just a 5 mins walk from the North Acton tube station which means you are approx 20-25 mins to central London. Bus stop is just in front of the hotel and its easily noticeable so reaching it is really easy!!  Nice spacious room and good breakfast on the offer. While during the breakfast it gets busy but the lobby is huge. The breakfast is nice, well laid out and with lots of options. If you have specific request yes they cater to that as well. Also tried the dinner on one of the nights and it was also quite good- we tried a bit of Vietnamese and Thai and both were good. Even the staff guided us on the portions, selection the warmth was good. The hotel staff especially the full F&B team was super and so so helpful  The only thing I struggled was to get'},\n",

The hotel was well run and very efficient. The staff were excellent and helpful when we needed to store our bags for the day and get a taxi for our next location. We also liked online ordering for room service. Excellent location. Modern, very clean. Room was great (upgraded to wonderful single suite).  Highly professional and friendly staff (thank you Sara A at checking). There were always staff on hand to direct and assist. Good restaurants and great breakfast. The sushi at Ishi was delicious.  I had the prawn crunchy and salmon amd avocado rolls.  Others had the sushimi and various other dishes.  The service by Jasha was even better.  We had a company dinner wirh seven people.  She was very patient with our larger group. Thanks Jasha! Visiting for work and brought my husband with.  We didn’t want to leave our hotel so decided to try out the hotel restaurant.  Fantastic food and great service from Jasha!  Recommend yellowtail and salmon carpaccio. We loved our visit and highly recommend. Absolutely fabulous hotel Staff, lovely Location, perfect Linen, lovely Towels, lovely Room temperature, perfect/adjustable Bathroom, lovely shower and bath, with a small range of products Views absolutely amazing Breakfast excellent Would highly recommend Good value for money too Thank you  Booked this hotel for my son and his girlfriend who were visiting London for the weekend. Having stayed on a few occasions myself, I knew it was a fantastic hotel with great facilities.  They really enjoyed their stay rating it 5* room/Service/Location and enjoyed breakfast. It is superbly located near to all London's main sights and not to far from Euston. Thanks Park Plaza We are a family of 4 from Brazil: me, my wife and 2 kids. The concierge Hassan made the difference during our days in London helping us in all that we need it! Every day helping us with all kind of things. Thank you so much Hassan and congrats for your great work ! Stayed here for 3 nights and 4 days hotel is situated in a very good place with amazing view and surroundings. Everything about the room is good except the cleaning part, would give 3/5 We ordered food in the room, service was good by Maria she was polite and nice, food was also delicious but little overpriced. Private and black cab both were available just outside. All thr famous places for visitor is nearby. This hotel is amazing. The room we had was a suite so it was big and clean. The view and location were great. The food is lovely and the complimentary bath products are womderful. We really enjoyed our stay here. It is very expensive but we did like it. Habib was amazing and the best server we had!! He was so polite and super friendly!! We stayed at the Radisson in mid January and were here for a sisters trip. He made our stay more enjoyable and always had a smile on his face. I would absolutely recommend staying here. Habib was the absolute best! Super friendly and welcoming! Our stay at Park Plaza Westminster Bridge wouldn’t have been the same without him. Recommendations on drinks and a friendly smile at Primo made our stay. Hit him up if you’re staying here! Denis was very friendly on the bar! We had a great stay & all staff were very welcoming! Great facilities & also the bed was extremely comfortable. Very good quality for the service that was provided by the staff & the facilities were amazing! Myriam was a life saver. After a transatlantic flight I found myself 6 hours early for my checkin at the hotel. Myriam was more than accommodating not only did she find me a room she also got me an upgrade. One of the best experiences at a Raddison. The hotel staff were Professional and friendly and the service has much improved since we were last here by all staff, specially Myriam in reception, who made us welcome from the start and went above and beyond to make cater for our family needs, we really look forward to returning and exploring London from such a great location. Fantastic service and sushi. Habib was very helpful and went above and beyond to help us get served when the dining area was full. He seated us in the bar area and allowed us to order from both sushi and hotel bar menus. Extremely accommodating. Would absolutely recommend. Such a lovely atmosphere. Would highly recommend, especially if you’re in the area. Habib was amazing, really attentive and knowledgeable. Habib answers all of our questions and made sure we made the most of our time in London. I would absolutely recommend visiting. I definitely recommend this hotel in London! It’s right across from the Big Ben , great location!! This hotel is spectacular!!  My experience at the Bar in the hotel was wonderful !! Denis, the Bartender is so friendly and have a good energy!! I had such a good time !!  Thank you so much for this amazing experience!! Hotel atmosphere is great. Bartender Denis makes amazing drinks and is very nice. However room bathroom wasn’t great. Toilet clogged after first use and then shower flooded the floor when I got out. Shower floor is also painful to stand on since the grip they used is too raised and feels like I’m standing on rocks. This hotel is absolutely  wonderful. Fantastic location, clean, smart and welcoming. Mariana checked us in and was polite, helpful, friendly and went the extra mile to ensure we had the best room possible!  The room had brilliant amenities and was so comfortable. We’d love to stay again! My first time ever here and I can say it is the best experience I could’ve imagined, from the moment I walked in the staff were super super friendly, especially Caitlin, Caitlin did a really really good job making me feel welcome, she helped me check in with ease, always smiling, the best first impression I could’ve gotten. We really like the lobby bar Habib was very kind and his service was outstanding. Food and drinks were great , everything very clean and comfortable ,  hotel is in great location and beautiful walking distance to many good restaurants and places our room view was amazing will definitely be back. Wonderful hotel, great facilities especially the pool,gym, food and room service. Also, I will commend your staff on being so friendly and welcoming. I have enjoyed my stay here and I'm sure I will be back again. Absolutely loved my stay at Park Plaza, Westminster Bridge.  A brand is only as good as its people and we met some great people who worked at this hotel. Riya checked us in and was a pleasure to deal with. As a member of Radisson Rewards I was offered a room upgrade and she noticed it was my birthday shortly and gave me vouchers for two drinks at the bar.  Room was excellent with a lovely view of Big Ben. Breakfast was ample and the bar very pleasant.  Initially I thought the hotel may be too far away from the theatre I had booked for the evening but even on a crisp January night, it was a pleasant 20 minute walk with some iconic views along the route.  This will now be our go-to hotel in London.  Thank you Park Plaza. Stayed here for business. Fantastic hotel, great location. The rooms are a good size, the studio rooms in particular are lovely. The gym and pool are also of a high quality and a great way to relax after a long day.  Staff are very helpful too. Thank you Paula. Fantastic hotel, wonderful staff, great location. Ticked all the boxes for me. Will definitely stay again when I'm in London.   From check in to the digital room keys and online check in and check out, this hotel had it all. So easy and just a great experience overall all. Thank you! Lovely room with a great view of London Eye from the nineth floor Next time I vist I will be straying long.. Only thing was that there was not a usb charging point in the room. Could do with  a bit more of choices of bar food. Had an evening event organize with the hotel it was amazing friendly and professional staff  Big up to the managers on site for the evening too they knew how to make us feel special  Thank you thank you  Finally massive thank you to the chefs and the team for such amazing food 🫶🏾🥇 The Hotel rooms were also very nice  Slept like a baby  And the brekkie never disappoint  Will definitely recommend the Park plaza Westminster !!   This hotel was amazing. It was clean and the hotel staff was very friendly and welcoming. The king room is inexpensive for a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 children). The dual climate air control for the two rooms was very helpful. We visited London and we were looking for a good hotel. This hotel is located near the bridge just few steps to Big Ben. Clean rooms and easy check in/out. I would recommend this hotel for families. Good breakfast with good view on the bridge.. My friend I booked this hotel because we thought it was affordable and in a convenient area. We were right, but we didn’t realize we booked something  so fancy and classy.   Such a beautiful hotel from the outside to the inside. Such awesome and interesting decor. Everything about the hotel was total class.   Our room was amazing. It was comfortable, had everything we needed, and a beautiful view of the London Eye.   Staff was fantastic, especially Olivia, who treated us so wonderfully.  Everyone was so friendly and helpful.   If I get the chance to go back to London, I will definitely be staying here again. Couldn’t have asked for a better place/location. Thank you, Park Plaza! I must express my utmost disappointment and frustration with my recent experience at this hotel, which I am compelled to label as the worst I have ever encountered. Throughout my stay, numerous issues arose, but one particular incident stands out as the epitome of miscommunication and utter disregard for guests' convenience.  To my astonishment, no one at the hotel deemed it necessary to inform us about the mandatory requirement of wristbands. This revelation came at the worst possible moment, as my companions and I arrived excitedly, filled with anticipation for our stay. Our high spirits were swiftly dampened when we were abruptly stopped at the entrance by none other than police officers, who demanded that we present our wristbands, a possession we were entirely unaware of.  The location of this hotel is the best! Just across the bridge from Westminster Abbey/Elizabeth Tower with Big Ben. 2 tube stations are very close: Waterloo and Westminster Stations.  Could only give 4 stars because check in was horrendous. Emailed to ask for early check in before arrival and was told could not be guaranteed. Ok. Arrived at 9am and asked again and they said room was not available, but would put it on priority list to be cleaned. Gave our number so we could be notified once it was ready. Regular check in time of 3pm came and went with still no text?! Ended up finally getting a room at 5pm!!! We had taken a red eye flight so this whole scenario was not fun. The hotel has some pro and cons: + location. The location is great. The view of the Big Ben and the London Eye is perfect.  +the staff is friendly. - it is a mass hotel. Nothing is personal or genuine.  -the breakfast is terrible. All industrial kitchen. -the pool is small and you need to book it. 30min per day. - the room was damaged everywhere. The glass of the closed was broken. The bed was hard and small. The sofabed was very hard.  All in all, the hotel has very good location and friendly staff but thats all. My dear friend and I went to London to celebrate her birthday and our 20 year friendship & chose to stay at PPWMB.      I was in contact with guest relations beforehand and Lorella was absolutely a delight to communicate with as was everyone at the hotel.   We had a warm welcome as we arrived-  our room was ready a little early so we were able to check in - but also conciërge will secure your bags if check in isn’t quite ready so exploring can begin   It’s a great location central to many areas and within walking distance to Lambeth underground or also Waterloo.     The rooms were clean and well attended to & everyone we encountered was wonderful.   The beds and pillows were very comfortable.   Something I also noticed was how often I saw people in various areas cleaning I had a wonderful 1 night stay at this hotel. The entrance hall is very impressive, and although it was busy, there were lots of staff at the Reception desks to help. I checked in and requested a quiet room. To my absolute delight, I was upgraded for no extra charge to a studio room with a view of the London Eye. From my room I could also see the river and Houses of Parliament. It had everything I could ever want, including robes, slippers, a huge bed and tv, as well as separate lounge area. To add to this, as I had to wait past 3pm for my room to be ready, I was gifted a free drinks voucher for the bar. The bar itself is beautiful and very relaxing. There was a live singer, but you could also be in away from it. The service was quick and efficient. I had a great stay, and have Awful service  Very expensive breakfast with powder pre made scrambled eggs everything else didn’t have any taste Also the  concierge service did not help us at all.     Hotel was charging everything I felt like I was in a low budget hostel that you need to pay to clean your room. We had a lovely time at this beautiful hotel. We would like to especially thank Achike who was very helpful to us during our trip. Definetly a great place to stay in the heart of London! We will be back soon My wife and I are very experienced travelers having visited 7 countries in 2023. This was our second visit to London this year. First in late January and most recently the week before Christmas and both times we stayed at the Park Plaza.     From checkin to departure this property has exceeded  our expectations.  Very friendly and accomodating staff who are eager to please. The rooms are spotless with great pillows and bedding and big, fluffy towels - and lot of them😊  I want to especially recognize several extraordinary staff members in Guest Services and in the Executives Lounge. The Guest Services staff is amazing at responding to both simple and complex challenges with a smile and positive  “can do” attitude.  Sophie, Michaela and Lorena were most  helpful in correcting an Staying at the Park Plaza Westminster Hotel was the Best decision we could have made for our International trip.  From the front desk to the housekeeping - everyone provided first class service at all times .  Amazing location & even better ambiance at the Hotel. I truly believe there is no better pace to stay when visiting London.   - Mr. Francis \"},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': 'Really nice rooms! And the staff there was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was not that good though, that could have been alit better. Many things. But the eggs where bad and seemed like it was made yesterday. Having stayed in some Ibis’ before I was apprehensive about what our room would be like - I needn’t be! Very stylish and modern throughout the hotel. Our room was perfect size for two people. My friend and I stayed here to watch a concert in the O2. It’s only one tube stop away from the O2. Really good location. Staff were really friendly at reception and the hotel room was super clean. Couldn’t fault it at all. Will definitely stay again. I came here by underground train just a cross the road very easy. My room was on a high floor with a good view. There was Tea/coffee tray. Nice flat screen TV. The bathroom was nice with fluffy towels. I did enjoy my breakfast. The staff were very friendly. I will be back. Thank you to all the staff. Have been here several times, I really like the ambience. The staff are always very attentive and being regular visitors, they know what we want. We will always get a wonderful, welcoming smile from Klaudija, And the rest of the crew. Although we haven’t tried the food, the customers who have ordered don’t seem to be complaining at all and finish their plates. This must be quite a good recommendation of the quality of the food. This is a very nice hotel with very friendly staff. They are so welcoming and help where and whenever they can!! Tahir is such a sweet person but of course everyone else!! They always make sure that you feel comfortable und happy.  Lovely little hotel. Directly opposite the tube and bus station. Near MacDonalds and Starbucks for Breakfast chouces . Large luggage store. Comfortable bed. One very happy customer. Felt safe returning at night as close to tube station.   Amazing beautiful hotel. Friendly, helpful and proffessional staff. I specifically want to mention WILLIAM at the frontdesk. He made us( my sister, my husband and me) very welcomed and comfortable. He is proffessional, kind, friendly and attentive to details. Thank you Mr. William I also have to mention what I believe is the Frontdesk manager, didtn\\'t get her name. She had a bit of an attitude and was abit snobbish when I asked for another key card coz I had left my room key card in my jacket that I forgot in the restaurant during breakfast. Hope she is/will be ok with whatever she was/is going through. I will definately recommend Ibis London Canning Town Hotel to my friends and family. Fantastic hotel in a great location, the rooms were clean and modern with a great bathroom. Check in was quick and the staff members were really helpful and accommodating.  The bar/cafe downstairs was also really good with great pizzas! Ibis @ Canning Town London was a great experience, the staff was amazing, especially Cornelia, the lounge magnificent, the food/drinks great and the rooms nice (too small for me but clean). I would recommend this place to all friends and family, they are on their A-Game!  5 Star Hotel 🏨 at reasonable prices!!! You can\\'t lose here, it felt like HOME! Curtis is the best !!  great place to stay for The 02 , easy to use the tube opposite   GREAT BREAKFAST !!  a little noisy at night with emergery sirens but out of control for hotel  CURTIS is the best  Quite room. Located near to O2 arena and North Greenwich and the Jubilee line connects you quickly to the city. Westfield shopping centre is a short tube ride away and the DLR takes you to City airport  Hotel is decent, clean and cheerful. Reception staff on arrival was very nice and went the extra mile and we got a room upgrade and 2 drinks at the bar which with London prices went a long way. Hotel is a good location especially if going to the 02. Overall a decent hotel and would stay here again when next visiting London. This hotel gives everything you would expect, from a quick and efficient check in, a clean and well presented room, to an excellent breakfast.  It is across the road from the underground station (jubilee line).  The staff should be very proud of what is offered Everything was perfect. The rooms were spacious and clean . One of best night’s sleep I’ve had in ages, and couldn’t hear the traffic at all. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful. A special mention of the concierge staff - especially Curtis, who was extremely polite and very helpful. We’ll done! We checked in at almost 10pm, on arrival I was stopped by security and said what are you doing when I went to use the lift. My friend was in crutches and I said I\\'m using the lift because my friend is on crutches! It was quite bizarre. Then he calmed down but surely if you see someone struggling then that\\'s why the disabled lift is be used.  Ibis downstairs is really cute, cosy and done nicely. It has candles on in the evening it\\'s really lovely. At the check in desk I was told I needed to pay for my room. I said I\\'ve paid already, he said let me check. Embarrassingly the man serving me colleague who was stood next to him shook his head and said no it\\'s paid. Again embarrassingly for the man serving me said oh I think my colleague knows more than I do.  I asked if a The hotel overall is in an excellent location and the rooms have everything you need for a good nights sleep. We were staying one night to watch a concert at the o2 so we were close and breakfast in the morning had a great choice to choose from.   The only thing that ruined my stay was that at 9am I had the cleaner knock on the door which woke me up from my sleep. I was a bit confused as I specifically asked when we checked in what time was check out and they said 12 so when I opened the door she looked at me and I said to her, we’re here for just one night and we’re leaving today at 12. Around 11am AGAIN someone knocked on my door and it was the same lady again and I said to her we are leaving shortly, checkout is at 12 and all she said was I’m sorry. We left not long after Great check in and staff around the place at 2pm. Lovely room too, food great. Was told bar was 24hr but upon return that evening we got a cold and slightly rude reception and a flat no when requesting drinks. It was 2am so maybe it\\'s not quite a 24hr bar. Just don\\'t say it is. This is our go to hotel for our group but may well look at other options. My friend and I stayed at the Ibis in Canning Town and we had a great time.  We were going to a show at the O2 and this hotel was in the perfect position for the O2.  The hotel staff are super friendly. Our room was very clean and nicely decorated. No complaints from us. The Breakfast is great and I\\'d definitely recommend it.   It\\'s self service, continental and cooked. The waiter Tahir is a lovely friendly chap.  Very helpful. Reception team absolutely fantastic too Morrisons behind the hotel for any essentials. Tube is across the road. Jubilee line is one stop away from the 02. The 🚠 car is a 10 mins walk from the hotel and it takes you across the Thames to the O2.  That is a must for £6.  Fabulous hotel, great location, lovely rooms, great food.   Don\\'t hesitate just book it. We stayed overnight after a concert at the O2, it\\'s just one stop away and opposite the station so it ideal as I was worried about finding the hotel late at night with my daughter.  The room itself was compact but had everything we needed, bed was comfy and it was so clean, the bathroom was immaculate.  Breakfast was amazing and all the staff we met were super friendly and helpful.  I\\'m definitely coming back if I\\'m staying overnight again. This hotel was excellent. I wouid recommend it to anyone. Immediately across the road from the underground , a short reasonably priced  journey to the O2  Arena. The rooms were loveky and so clean and well decorated.  The best thing however was the staff, nothing too much trouble, a smile from everyone and gave a lovely family feel.  All of our party of 8 wouldn’t hesitate to return or recommend. Once again an enjoyable stay. Good size room. So convenient for transport. Just a bit noisy in the lounge/bar area - a separate quieter zone would be appreciated. \"Restaurant\" slightly misleading given the limited menu, but pizzas are good. More fruit needed for breakfast - berry compote, grapefruit, prunes, peaches, apricots perhaps. Overall excellent. 2 night stay for work purposes   Conveniently located across the road from  a London Underground station with the jubilee line operation regular services via central stations such as Westminster, as well as Dockland Light Railway (DLR) services to and from areas such as excel centre, London City Airport through to Tower Gateway ( for Tower of London and tower bridge).   There is also a number ofTFL bus services to various areas as well.   McDonald’s, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons all within a 5 minute walk of hotel.   Room was a modern double room to ibis standards with reasonable free space to walk around.   Shower and toilet facilities are to a standard you would expect from international hotels.   Staff attentive and happy to assist when required.   Check in quick and easy.   Thanks to Niall the general manager we had an amazing stay. We had the worst morning. We missed the train and then my husband lost his phone (thankfully it was found) We got to the hotel early where Niall greeted us, assured us we could check in early and gave us complementary drinks to help us relax and start enjoying the holiday. Niall is an asset to the company. The rooms were lovely and clean and perfect for see a show at the O2 as it is only one tube stop away. We would definitely stay again. This hotel is exceptional. And what makes it so, is the staff. Everyone goes out of their way to make you feel welcome. I was here for a big trade show and am in the luxury hotel segment. The genuineness and the pure hospitality of the staff is what sets this hotel apart, I received care that was completely unexpected and very welcome as a lone traveler in London. Nothing was too much- I needed printing, the front desk helped me. I came back hungry, sorted. Excellent restaurant recommendations, and the GM was even clearing plates from the breakfast service in order to accommodate all the hungry diners coming in. The rooms are well appointed, comfortable. I liked that I could locate all of the light switches and it wasn\\'t a guess how to turn off all the lights type of scenario. Nice hotel and good staff. However, the beds in the twin room are very narrow and not that comfortable (for me anyway). Also, the election of drinks at the bar isn’t very extensive and are a bit pricey. Great location right across the street from the DLR and Tube Station.   Just come back from a one night stay with my family. We booked the Abba  Voyage package. We all found the staff very friendly and accommodating at this hotel, in particular, Tahir. He made us feel very welcome and nothing was too much trouble for him. He always kept the tables clear, which was nice to see. The young girl behind the bar, sorry, didn’t take your name, was also very attentive and worked hard to ensure everything ran smoothly. Really nice clean hotel and would definitely recommend. Rooms are neat and tidy, with everything you need. Beds comfy, what more can you want. Oh and breakfast was delicious too. I was staying in this hotel due to work over a period of 21 months with gaps between. The whole team is always friendly and helpful. Give recommendations for restaurants, trips and things to do. Behind the reception is a lobby with bar which invites you to linger and enjoy the evening. The rooms were and are always clean with daily housekeeping. The breakfast has something for everyone. I can highly recommend this hotel with the location (next to the Jubilee Line Station, from where you are in less than 20 minutes in central London), the team and the hotel facilities. Excellent staff, good rates and very good location of the hotel next to canning town station. Highly recommended. Will be staying here again next time I am in London. Please make use of the bar, good prices Curtis on reception was just exceptional. He really lifted our spirits the moment we walked into the hotel. He is an asset to this hotel and is one of the main reasons we will be returning. We had The best experience just what we needed after a very busy day a smooth check in process in depth knowledge and Curtis making us laugh couldn\\'t have asked for more. Thank you Curtis we will be walking those hills and thinking of you 🤣🤣  Great stay and the common area looks better than on pictures with a lively atmosphere but the manager was passive aggressive and not welcoming because I wanted to wait before ordering a beer as my friend was close by and on his way.  What an amazing place to stay in! It was a very comfortable stay with the most hospitable staff. Specially Taahir, he was very kind with us and our toddler also loved his company!! The hotel is situated just across a train station so traveling was very convincing! They have a nice ambiance downstairs at the lobby where you can enjoy drinks! Also bot to forget the lavish breakfast they serve! All in all a very good hotel! My second stay in this hotel and second review (first on the hotel site). First stay was 6 months ago and my rating was 5+. But now my rating is 2. Let\\'s say about my 3-night stay: Pros: Very polite and helpful front-desk staff, very convenient location, good breakfast, clean, everyday housekeeping.  Cons:  1. In my room there was only two big bath towels. No face towels. I\\'ve asked the housekeeper and the answer was that no face towels are provided for my room. Then I asked the front-desk staff and receive towels I needed. Next day - no towels again. I\\'ve asked the front-desk staff and receive... 2 feet towels. I didn\\'t use them of course. Next day - no face towels again. I didn\\'t asked for face towels, used big towels which was totally wet  after taking a shower.  May be next Really great gem of a hotel. Friendly and perfectly located opposite underground. The rooms are small but perfectly equipped. Good value too.  Ibis is a bit hit & miss but this one has to be up there with the best. Highly recommend if you\\'re visiting London. The Hotel is very centric and with good connections to move around. The people was very nice and the breakfast really good.  The only issue was the size of the room, a bit small. But for the rest was a very pleasant experience.  The customer service at this Ibis is exceptional.  Curtis in particular made me fell like a member of the family. Food good - can recommend the pizza and the breakfasts.  Comfy room. Very clean.  I also love the robot vacuums. Organising an event in excel and ibis excel fully booked. Ended up in Canning Town. Incomparably better. Lovely room. Great vibes in the bar. Cracking breakfast. Brilliant service and staff. It’s my go-to now. A 20 minute fresh air walk to excel was actually a pleasure too This os a nice, modern hotel.   Its at a perfect location for easy transport connections to O2 and London.   The underground is literally across the road, mcdonalds, pret, Costa within 2 minute walk... and lots more! We stayed in September 23 after originally booking to stay in May 21, we had to cancel our original booking and even though we had a non refundable deal, the manager did the right thing and gave us a voucher. Well done Dan👍.   The hotel was spotlessly clean, the rooms large enough for a short stay, quite, and the bed really comfortable. The bar area was clean and the beer and wines good value.   One evening there was live music which was unexpected and enjoyable.   Overall we were originally only staying here for easy access to the O2, but I’ll probably choose to stay here again for other visits because value for money, friendliness of staff, good transport links and the overall standard.   Thanks to all the people who made our stay enjoyable. (And the weird robot hoovers I I haven\\'t stayed in an Ibis for about 15 years, and it was an OK then, nothing to shout about, so my expectations were... \\'this will be OK\\'.   First impressions, loved the candle lined steps to the lobby! Immediately had a nice welcome, a trainee was being trained. She was very apologetic about being slow, but truthfully it was one of the speedier check ins of late at any hotel 😂 the manager training her was also super kind.   I have Gold Accor status so was upped to a corner room on top floor which was nice.   The windows in this room open (hooray!)   The phone signal on voda phone was 2 bars with decent data, if not on occasion ‘London patchy’.   The good;  - nice personalised welcome in the room of some snacks, and two additional waters.  - The bed was comfortable, not too My very large extended family stayed here for my niece\\'s wedding. It is a lovely hotel. Rooms very comfortable and extremely clean, lovely food and the staff were wonderful. They couldn\\'t do enough to help us, from taking a photo of us all before the wedding to calling taxis when it started to rain. Very convenient for all transport links. Highly recommended.'},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': 'My son and I stayed in a private room for one night. The room was great! Very clean! The pillows were great! Soft and pliable, not too full or hard. The location was nice and the neighborhood was cute. We would definitely stay here again. They have a pretty great double bed room which was really great for me and my partner. As backpackers, you don’t often get the luxury of sharing a bed. We went in winter and the main problem with the room was that it was so hot! The heating was unbearable and as we were on the mezzanine, it was even worse. The other (minor) problems we had was that there was coffee/ tea in the common room but never any milk. The sheets also aren’t fitted in the bedroom so you need to make your bed up every day because they keep coming undone.  The showers on the top floor are the cleanest by far. It is worth the walk and no one was ever there.  Otherwise, a great stay! Very cosy. Staff were lovely. We would definitely stay there again.  Lovely place. Great location. The staff were friendly and  welcoming. The building is beautiful (the lounge is really beautiful with the Christmas decorations up). Clean and nice room, very comfortable bed and pillows. Would certainly stay again.  Friendly welcome at reception, beautiful house, very comfortable lounge room with hot drinks, bunk beds have curtains so you have privacy for changing and sleeping. Good location. There is also a bar in the basement. Had to leave just before 7am so couldn\\'t have the breakfast which only starts 7am. Our private room was so small we could barely open our suitcases - The door hit the bed when you walked in. It was not as advertised online at all. It was more of a closet than a room. They installed a portable bathroom which took up half the room, and there was no barrier between the shower and toilet which was gross - Water would flood the bathroom floor anytime you showered and toilet would get moist from the condensation - the room would fog up as well.   There also wasn\\'t a way to turn off the bathroom light - We asked for assistance and the staff couldn\\'t turn it off either. They said they would send maintenance up but we stayed there for three days and it was never fixed, so we slept with it slightly dim.   If you are staying with a friend and want a normal sized room, I Staff was very welcoming and amenities were nice. Great for solo travelers. Would recommend for other young or solo travellers. Great location close to train station. Easy tube commutes into central London. Good neighborhood.  Absolutely beautiful hostel with a quiet and cozy atmosphere - perfect if you\\'re searching for a more relaxed stay. The room was clean and I had no issues with it (except that it did get very hot at night). In addition, the breakfast (for 6.50) was good and satisying before going out for the day. The only critique I had was that the bathroom was small and I didn\\'t like that they were unisex; in addition, the shower was frequently dirty and could be cleaned more. Other than that, a fantastic stay and I really enjoyed it - especially the lounge area. You definitely should not stay here if you want a normal sized room. Our private room (2 people) was an L shaped room, probably 5 feet wide and 8 feet long. It was so tiny I can’t even begin to think how anyone would be comfortable in it! On top of that, the bathroom light is not able to be turned off. It seemed to be a mobile bathroom placed in the room, which contributed to the tiny size of the room outside the bathroom. Do not book their private room, it is absolutely insane and not worth any money!  I m writing this review and sitting in this lovely place while my bus arrives. I have been in many hostels worldwide but this one is special. The best thing I enjoyed was breakfast, it was a 5 stars one. Then the place itself, the architecture, the rooms .  toilets were always clean and accessible. The location is perfect less than 20min to Westminister via Jubilee line. Personnel are nice and very helpful. Highly recommend it! Perfect location, just a few minutes walk from the tube station.  The lounge is absolutely beautiful, especially with the Christmas decorations up. The bar/breakfast area is very trendy, and plenty of room for everyone.  The breakfast is great value, £6.50 for a continental.  Towels are £2 to hire, a bit on the small side, but adequate.  Room was far too hot, and sharing with 3 strangers I didn’t want to open the window…  Bed was comfortable, the room was clean. I stayed in a 4 bed en-suite female room. The en-suite was a little small, and the room was difficult to navigate with 4 people trying to get ready, but still good value in my opinion. Stayed couple of nights, lounge area is perfect to get some work done, excellent Wi-Fi. Bathrooms, showers are clean and regularly cleaned. Bedrooms are clean, warm and very quite. Reception is very friendly. Location easily accessible. Less than five minute walk to subway and bus stations. Breakfast very affordable and worth it taking into account how expensive London is. Nice old building with pleasant common areas. There are some private rooms available. I was initially looking for a hotel, but stumbled upon this hostel with the option of private room. That was the main reason I opted for this location.  Friendly personnel. On the downside: old building can be noisy (squeaky floors, thin walls). The staff were super friendly and helpful,( I stayed for another week). Knowledgeable about the area and where the best places to go. Great location with good transport links. Breakfast was good with a great selection of things to have. If you didn\\'t want to cook your own food there were loads of places to eat nearby. Excellent value for money. The room and beds were Clean and comfortable. The Staff  are friendly and helpful and the communal areas are really welcoming and attractive. The location is really convenient for public transport into Central London Absolutely brilliant and friendly staff, comfortable and clean beds with privacy curtains, super friendly and trustworthy people i never thought at any moment that something of mine was going to be taken, super close to two stations too! Would definitely go again. Very comfy! Clean, lovely service, charming room - the building itself is esoteric and beautiful, and it\\'s a quick bus ride to the centre. I was very pleasantly surprised, and slept wonderfully. An easy five stars for the price.  I have been to so many countries and stayed in so many hostels, hotels and AirBnBs over the years... never in my life  my own things were made unaccessible for me and at the end taken from me. I bought products that had to be stored in the fridge (the hostel has one fridge accessible for guests in the kitchen). I had to leave early in the morning to catch my flight... found the kitchen locked... went to the reception, and the guy there was indifferent, cold and unhelpful, said there was no way to access the kitchen until other staff come later in the day. I had to either leave without my stuff or wait for the other staff i.e. miss my flight. At the end for the worth of what I left there, I could have stayed in a better place. It felt like my things were stolen from me. What if Love this hostel! Nice view from window. Room for 2 was really clean and we liked the furniture and comfortable bed.  Staff are lovely and friendly.  Location is ideal for going to central London.  Check out the insane Swiss Cottage pub down the road aswell! As someone who has been traveling to London for the past 15 years,  is the best and the safest hostel ever.  Located next to a shopping mall, shops, undeground and a train station. If you come by bus from Luton or Gatwick airport, the bus stops almost next to it. It\\'s equipt with everything you might need for a comfortable stay, and even if you forgot something,  you can rent it, or buy it, for a very low price. Every bed had dark curtains of its own, which creates privacy,  in addition to the fact, that you can sleep, even of there is a light , in the room.   The personal is very friendly and welcoming. ❤️ It\\'s amazing hostel , I recommend it every thing is excellent wifi, bathrooms  cleaned , bed  comfortable,  location I liked and need from underground a coaches stations , lounge and bar amazing , staff are friendly  The place is nice and relatively tidy. The staff were friendly. It is quite a large hostel though and it only has two washing machines -one of which was broken. I was quite disappointed in this as having these amenities was part of the reason I booked this place. The lockers are also not big enough and there was a lot of luggage strewn about the dorm room. The bunks are stacked 3 tall and I really struggled to sleep here. No male bathroom on the second floor was frustrating. Beautiful building, a treat in itself. Large and varied Continental breakfast, and a pleasant bar with lots of beer on tap (and wine on offer as well.) Very pleasant staff.  Very easy to get to on the Jubilee line.  I only stayed there for a night, but the check in went very smoothly, the check out too. The hostel is really nice, I felt safe and it looked clean. The location is also nice like it’s not the best place in London but it’s still a very good location. I will definitely come back again, especially for the price. As per usual, if you are nice and behave well, you will appreciate the place :)  Haven\\'t stayed here for over a year but everything seems improved.Good value,Alex at reception was obliging,cleanliness improved,seems more streamlined. I\\'m a bit older so a bottom bunk was great.Well done Found this gem online and booked the double room with ensuite bathroom. The room was very comfortable and we loved the decor. The location was great with a short walk to the Swiss Cottage tube station and we felt comfortable walking in the area at night. Excellent value and we will def be booking again. Thank you.  Beds were clean and showers were decent. Good location as well My only issues were:  1. There was no hair dryers on my floor 2. Some shower booths got clogged and were flooding/got super gross 3. Due to the lay out of the hostel, there isn’t much socializing 4. Room doors were very loud when opening/closing Super accommodation, terric value for the price. The building is beautiful. Separate room was available for this older female traveling solo, the staff were friendly and helpful, the room was spotless, the double bed was very comfortable and the pillows were the best on my trip. I felt very safe here. All this for such an affordable rate! Location of the house is splendid, had a snor machine right above me but that wasn\\'t enough to put me down, staff is polite and lovely, great breakfast for you stomach slaves, great bar/lounge rooms to accommodate your stay overall would come again and recommend it to others, stayed in the 18 bed bunker When I arrived there had been an accidental mix up on the system, putting me in a mixed room instead of female. The staff were very accommodating and sorted it out immediately. It has nice facilities and is one of the better hostels I have stayed at and one of the most flexible with the 24 hour reception enabling me to check in at 11 pm and out at 5am. Would definitely stay here again. Good value for money Dirty rooms. Dirty bathrooms. My bed was used when I got there. Blood stain on my sheets, although housecleaning changed. It. If I had time to change hostels or get an Airbnb I would. Front desk staff were kind and very helpful. I did receive a free drink for my troubles which was nice. Good thing was the blackout curtains for each bunk bed and your own plug which was convenient. Not far from bus stops and underground trains. Unfortunately,I will never stay in this hostel again. Yuck.  Its a beautiful old building, and an excellent location to access central London quickly. The price was very reasonable (for London) - I paid £100 per night for a private twin ensuite. Very chill atmosphere, and quiet upper floors, so easy to sleep.  The only downside for me was that all the staff I interacted with seemed pretty unfriendly. Me and a friend needed a room for the night in a central location need bars/clubs etc.  Last minute booking cost £50 each.  It was very easy to find, very easy to check in, very polite and helpful gave recommendations about where we should go.  Very clean, can come and go as you please (we got back at 3am) stayed in 9 bed shared dormitory and they are so cute!! Reminded me of Oliver Twist, all dark wood and little ladders up to the beds. Very comfy and cosy. Was ever so hot in the night because of the curtains round the bed but that’s the only downside. Shower was super clean and the pressure was good.  The building has a sort of Hogwarts kinda vibe.  Enjoyed it very much and I’d 100% stay here again.  About a 15 min walk ish from Camden centre.  Excellent location, quiet surroundings, helpful staff, breakfast is value for money, bathroom could done with renovation. Bed quite narrow. Heating ok in September but windows very poor insultation. Overall good value for money. I wish I could give this place a better review.  My cards would not work here- and while I thought something was wrong with my cards, it turned out this was the *only* place in London they would not work, which is strange.  I spent from midnight to 2 am trying to figure things out, and then left at 5:30 am over my need to get to the airport and thinking I had to have extra time due to my cards \"not working\" that it turns out I could have spent sleeping.  Place was clean, staff was friendly, felt uncomfortable walking through neighborhood at night, had booked here due to option of female only dorm room although I couldn\\'t see anyone in the dorm during the 3 hours I ended up having to sleep, had storage options that could lock but only if you have your own lock with you.  People Good location. Fantastic building, friendly staff, value for money. Meet many other travellers, shared good experience, good bar and good breakfast. It is highly recommended. I shall come back with my friends.   Very well organized hostel with super friendly stuff. Centrally located and very close to the subway and buses. The kitchen with a fridge and luggage storage was convenient. Wasn’t my first stay. Mind the steep stairs to the basement. Some years ago I stumbled and had torn the miniskus. Didn’t regret that I returned for a short stay.  Stayed for a night but really enjoyed it ! Nice breakfast too. Rooms and bed are clean ! Same for the washrooms. Usb plugs on the wall ! Quiet place during the night. Very kind staff. Would recommend this place ! Pretty near from the cottage underground station too ! As stated in the other reviews, the hostel is built in an old, impressive building and they did very well at adjusting the features to the house. The furnishing is really stylish. We were staying in a 8-bed-female-dorm and it was quite cramped. There weren\\'t any hooks to hang your wet rain jackets nor any shelves to put your stuff. It would have been nice to have a little bit more space. Also the bathrooms were not as clean as we would have hoped. All in all a good hostel. Excellent stay. Peaceful nights. Privacy in the dorms thanks to the curtains. Really pleasant staff and very accommodating when I asked for a bottom bunk. Not too crowded at the moment and good value for money. Stuffy rooms. No AC, no fans, zero airflow. Just a room of 10 people breathing and making it SO HOT you cannot sleep. Total waste of $70!!!!! The privacy curtains would be nice but im sure they made it even hotter. '},\n",

Am continuing to raise the issue as this is unacceptable and unsafe for women. We really loved our stay! The hotel is lovely - super clean and comfortable, with excellent customer service from all staff, and it is in an amazing location - very close to Southwark tube station, on the Jubilee Line, and not far from Blackfriars.   We visited because it was our sister's birthday. We paid for the birthday package and thought it was well worth the money -  room with view of the Shard, birthday balloons, prosecco and birthday tasting treats and card! And we were fortunate to have an early check in.   We would 100% recommend this hotel! Been here many times. Rooms comfy, spacious and modern. Nice big tv for when you just want to sit in and order room service.   Rooms are cleaned each day and the refreshments replenished.   Really good location with 3 tube stations within 5mins.  Downsides I would say is rooms can be noisy when on lower floors but I suppose that’s a London thing. Other downside is that I always seem to be rushed through check in even when there is not a queue; I never get my complimentary drink or acknowledgment of my reward status which makes me think it’s been missed. Came here for dinner with my brother on a trip to London and it took 40 minutes to deliver our food. No one around to greet us and it took them forever to explain why are food was taking so long, (some mess up in the kicken) my burger was dry.   Staff were seen just standing around, looking board, and looking like they would like to be somewhere else .   Sadly wouldn’t come here again After a long train journey riddled with delays and cancellations, we arrived to a warm welcome by Giuseppe and his team at the Novotel, London Blackfriars. He had gone above and beyond when he gave our 4 year old daughter a Christmas stocking full of little goodies and toys. It made her day!!! We stayed in an executive room which had a lovely view of the Shard and was spacious for our family of 3. We had all the amenities we needed, from a kettle, coffee machine and complimentary bottles of water, to ‘the best hotel biscuits my husband has ever had’!!!  Bath robes and slippers were provided and we used them when we had a dip in the pool - it was lovely, along with the sauna! Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, such as extra milk, pillow etc. Use of their internal The team in the restaurant was great, esp. Mrs. Sanam! Thank you.    The cleaning team was o.k. . Sometimes they forgot to refilling shampoo etc.   The location of the hotel is very good. Near to all sightseeing points.  We stayed here for 4 days and everything was very good, very clean and very good service and helpful staff.   The breakfast was amazing and the staff was so kind especially a woman called sanam, she was very warm and spread so much good energy and happines Great location, very friendly people, cosy room, windows are opening to freah air, unlike many other hotels that have sealed windows or looking to the staircase.   If you need something, Rupok the guy on the front desk, he will solve all your problems! The Hotel it beautiful and the most gorgeous is the staff, specifically Isha, she is so helpful and very kind. Especially with my kid at all time. The room isn’t small and is very comfortable. The pillow are amazing.  We booked this hotel in advance and when we arrived, a very nice receptionist received us. He could do the checkin very fast and got us already the hotel cards ready. The room was clean and tidy. The central location makes this hotel also very adorable. A modern hotel which invites people to have a great stay in London. We are very happy that we booked this hotel and can recommend it absolutely. We visited this hotel for a 1 night stay whilst visiting London. The hotel is ideally situated next to Southwark tube station (2 minute walk). The hotel is bright and modern and exceptionally clean.   The staff we encountered were all fantastic and friendly. We found the room small for the price, not very spacious for a family room, sharing with our daughter. There was no both and only a shower. Room was very clean.   We opted for breakfast which was a Buffett style breakfast. There was plenty of choice. We found the Buffett hot breakfast the food wasn’t very hot. The sausage in particular wasn’t nice at all. The highlight for our daughter the hotel has a pancake machine that allows you to make your own pancakes.   Location is perfect you are a short stroll away from the Thames Excellent hotel, highly recommend. Staff all very polite and helpful. Especially Sanam, who was serving at breakfast. Very comfortable room. We had a nice meal in the evening, and great choice of food at breakfast. We traveled from the states to see the NFL game (Tottenham stadium) Blackfriars was amazing. We enjoyed our stay so much.  This was our very first time visiting England . We decided to take the tube from Heathrow and the ride was just 30-40 mins .When you exit the station the hotel is right around the corner and a small 2-3 minute walk. It is also a 5-7 min walk in the opposite direction from the railway. Also 2 stops away is Big Ben, the eye and beautiful views of the city. It is also a short walk down to the river where you there is a walkway and you can spend a wonderful day taking in London. This is a very convenient hotel!   When we walked in we were treated so well and took advantage of early check in . Front desk went above and beyond to accommodate our needs. There was a As always the Breakfast team at this hotel are the asset to this chain. Kudos to the manager for such a great team, always happy and cheerful team at breakfast. Breakfast was delicious and thanks to the chef as well…. Folks from the restaurant were really nice to the kids. Loved how Sanam and Isha made genuine connection with our kids in the time we stayed.. folks serving were really nice and kind. They took the time to hang around with the kids (and sat and made drawings with them). Hotel fitout has become rather tired for a 4 star experience ..We found the staff were excellent and efficient but the standard and presentation of the hotel needs some attention. The buffet breakfast we found  was very average in choice and presentation. We have recently arrived from Scandanavia where the Hotel buffet breakfasts were outstanding and the best I have ever seen Family vacation in Europe.   Booked two rooms.  When I did the online check-in, I have asked for an early checkin.    My flight arrives at 7am.    When I reached the hotel it was already 9:15.    I wanted to have a shower after the 14 hours flight.    The front desk staff Denisa said bluntly the rooms are not ready yet.    I should come back between  12:30 - 1:00 and see.     After wandering around for 4 hours and I went back expecting to have at least one room ready.     Denisa once again said no rooms are available.     By then I am really annoyed as this has never happend to me before.      I just told her to get me any room that is ready.   It doesnt matter which floor or type.    I am willing to accept a downgraded room.      She then checked the system and magically found Had the pleasure of staying in an Executive room for 7 days in September. From the moment we arrived staff were extremely welcoming and helpful. The room had fantastic views and luxurious facilities. It was very spacious and bed was extremely comfortable. The location is perfect for London sightseeing, you have access to the subway just down the road. The Thames is a 5 min walk away where you can either stroll or hop on a ferry. The restaurant at the hotel was great and we enjoyed all meals we ate there. Staff went above and beyond when I had left my handbag containing passports and money at breakfast. I didn’t discover this until I returned from a walk to Waterloo and returned to my room. I headed straight back to restaurant in a panic only to be greeted by maître d who assured Booked online and had a kerfuffle on arrival with checking in, all resolved and allocated a room. Was given an accessible room (I suspect the standard rooms were all allocated hence the kerfuffle). The room was nice and had a fridge with free water. Didn’t do breakfast as so much to eat around the hotel for half the price. It says 4 star and perhaps my expectations have dropped but felt more like a higher end 3. Location is good and in walking distance of St Paul’s, Westminster etc or Southwark tube 2 mins away. You pay London prices for a decent hotel and this fitted that bill and was at the affordable end of offerings. One of the best hotels I have stayed in! The hotel team instantly made myself and my family feel warm and welcome.  The rooms were clean with the most beautiful view looking out over Shard especially of a night, it was breathtaking. The beds were very comfortable and made up daily.  Food was lovely for breakfast (especially the pancakes) We had the loveliest of wait staff looking after us. A big shout out to @Isha who always came for a lovely chat of a morning and would ask how our holiday was going.  Definitely a place to return to ❤️ I have stayed in many Novotel branches through work over the years, and always received excellent service. I wasn’t let down yet again when a friend (I did say myself on the night to save her further embarrassment) was found caught out, in the middle of London, unable to find anywhere to resource some toiletries.  Having spent a lot of time in hotels over the years, I knew that they sometimes provide emergency toiletries, and Novotel was just across the street, so thought I’d at least ask the question. I spoke with Reina, the manager, and although she expressed that the hotel themselves would not be able to provide any, without any hesitation, she wandered off to resource some. She came back and discreetly handed them over to me.   I can’t honestly express just how professional, My overall experience at Novotel London Blackfriars was fantastic, and I must commend the exceptional service provided by Isha, the waitress. She went above and beyond to respond to all my requests with a warm smile and efficiency, making my dining experience truly enjoyable. The hotel's staff, including Isha, exemplify outstanding hospitality, and I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone visiting London. Thank you, Novotel London Blackfriars, for making my stay memorable. Excellent hotel, very well placed and managed, well connected to the Southwark station. The breakfast is great, Chef Ciprian makes the best omelets, absolutely loved it. Would highlight recommend this! Thank you at Ali Hassan and the night shift manager for all your help. Arrived late with confusion over the booking. All resolved quickly and very amicably. Great service. Thanks again. Will be back when next Town.  Reception staff excellent. Room lovely and clean. Plenty of towels. Great experience. My only criticism was the breakfast. The hot options limited and tepid. No vegan options and at £20 per head would have been better getting breakfast elsewhere.  Lovely hotel with friendly staff. The breakfast was fantastic, the kids especially enjoyed the pancake making machine.  The room was clean and comfortable.   Great location, we could walk to the Sealife centre and other big attractions in 15-20 mins. The pool was a little cold but the kids didn't mind! I would definitely recommend for families.   One of the best hotels I have stayed in! The hotel team instantly made myself and my family feel warm and welcome. They acknowledged it was my daughters 8th birthday and couldn’t do enough for her. The treatment she received (and the rest of us) was outstanding from start to finish.   The rooms were clean with the most beautiful view and the beds were very comfortable. Great blackout curtains as well.   Food was lovely for breakfast with plenty of variety the kids especially loved the fresh pancake maker!   I would like to thank the reception team especially one man who unfortunately I did not see his name, for all he did to make my daughters birthday so special and memorable.   If you have a family I would recommend this hotel not only for its friendly staff but the location is Our family bathroom was covered in mould, the drain was blocked so therefore your feet were swimming in dirty water. Shower pressure and water temperature was horrific. We stayed here for two nights and was unable to get a refund. The sauna and swimming pool area surrounded in mould to. Book yourself a stay at the Pullman Hotel in Euston. Also save your money on ordering food here as you can eat else where. Borough Market is a 15 -20 minute walk and offers amazing food.  After spending quite a bit of time researching options for my 'bucket list' trip to London from Sydney I finally decided on Novotel London Blackriars and am so glad that I did.  It is centrally located to several 'must see' attractions with tube stations very close and around 20 minute walk to London Eye and Tower Bridge together with the other attractions around that area.  The staff are exceptional from reception to housekeeping and the buffet breakfast is simply one of the best I have ever had anywhere with lots of options.  They even give you a hint in the lifts as to when the quieter times to have breakfast are,  I selected to pay a little more for an Executive Room which had a balcony with a view of The Shard and having fresh are was a wonderful experience.  Room was Location is great 5 minutes to the tube, surrounded by plenty of pubs, restaurants and small grocery stores. We had a room with a balcony which had a tremendous view across town. The room had a fridge which was handy. Breakfast is good, the bar is also nice and reception staff were always helpful. The pool in London was a bonus and my wife would use it daily. My only knock on the hotel was housekeeping. We stayed 7 nights and some days nothing more than changing the towels (if that was required we often use same towel for a few days) was done. Overall a solid Novotel experience. Staff is very courteous, helpful, friendly and professional. From Check in with Tatiana, to check out and in between, everyone was super. Giuseppe was really nice. The room was clean, great location near the tube and pool was nice. My son loved it! Wish we picked another hotel. Breakfast is ok. I wish there was more fresh fruit. Rooms are ok. Building itself is boring.  You have to reserve time for the pool, which is annoying. Also, jacuzzi is not hot. It’s same temperature as pool (which is heated). The area is okay. Nothing  special about this place.  We stayed in the family room for three nights.  The room was a good size and we really appreciated the two pull out sofa beds.  After an overnight plane ride, it was nice for my two teenagers to each have their own bed.  We used the nearby Southwark metro station many times while we were in London to get to all of the major attractions.  There is also a Tesco convenience store within walking distance where we bought lunchmeat, cheese, candy bars and drinks.   The only reason I gave this hotel 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the bathroom.  There is a very strange glass partition that divides the regular room from the bathroom.  There is a button that can be pushed to frost the glass, but we were still able to see the outline of whomever was in the shower.  This was kinda The hotel is very central in the city. You can walk to both London eye, Big Ben and Tower Bridge. The rooms are clean and there is pool in the basement (remember to book). We experienced several time long queues in the reception. The breakfast is fine. An overall great stay- room, restaurant, pool &gym. . Huge thanks to the fantastically helpful and supportive Reception staff who showed all the initiative and skills of full Concierge team. Very impressed.  With huge thanks.  After a terrible experience at another hotel, we required urgent accommodation.  TATIANA took my emotive call. We discussed availability of family rooms (just one room was still available) and the cleanliness of the hotel/room, and how to book it. My family needed urgent ‘rehoming’ for just one night, and Tatiana moved heaven and earth to get us the available family room along with an early check in.  When we arrived (early morning and in a very fragile state!), the room was not quite ready for our incredibly early check-in, so Tatiana and her team took our bags to hold and have taken to our room, and arranged for us to have complimentary coffees, hot chocolates, and pastries in the dining area while we waited. The service was impeccable as they served us our drinks and food and We paid £429 for a room with a queen bed in and two singles (aka a family room). This was without breakfast so already a very steep price. The room was tiny, like swing a cat tiny. It was not a queen bed, and the two singles was in fact one sofa cot bed squeezed up next to the double.  On enquiring at reception, whilst initially we were told there was nothing that could be done and all rooms were the same size, eventually we were offered an exec room. I was asked if it was better, it was exactly the same size with the same cot bed pushed up to a double. If they don’t have family rooms they shouldn’t charge for a normal room with a bed when you think you are paying for a room that sleeps four, it’s insulting to parents. We went to Novotel, knowing that their hotels never fail to impress. This time was no different. The rooms were wonderful, big and cozy. The minibar was full of room (in which the staff put free bottles of water and sparkling water). The pool was great. The breakfast had a large variety of foods (plus a cool pancake machine). In particular we would like to thank Royson, who was our waiter multiple times. He was very generous, and always gave us what we asked for, and the chef - Ciprian. Everything we requested, he always delivered without any problem. All in all, a great experience (as always with the Novotel brand). Excellent customer service from checkin to check out.   Rodney is an excellent manager.  The staff at the restaurant, including Mustafa, were always willing to make the breakfast meal to your preference and provided a great start to the day.   The rooms are a high quality and well maintained. The hotel facilities including the indoor swimming pool, great for the kids, and the gym and sauna were also to a great standard. Both the fitness facilities and pool added to the enjoyment of our stay in London.   The location is convenient to Southwark subway and it’s a 15-20 walk to ‘Borough markets and many other attractions on the south of the river.   Great hotel and I highly recommend staying with Novotel Blackfriars when in London.   I would certainly book here again in the future.  We had an incredible stay. I just wanted to say a massive thank you to Ali, Tatiana, Rodney & Royston & all the amazing staff. Outstanding staff genuinely friendly and efficient. They made our stay so a massive thank you to you all. The hotel is modern , super clean and the location was perfect plus next to a tube station for an easy commute to the airport. The standard of food & drinks was excellent. We loved our stay, great hotel and Great people working there. Thank you \"},\n",

Situated brilliantly between London Euston - circa 10 minutes walk, and Russel Square Tube station- 5 minutes walk. Hotel facilities very basic , if you want a kettle and choice of fine coffee and Darjeeling tea, accompanied with Hobnob biscuits etc in your room, then look elsewhere. The bed however was extremely comfortable, shared shower and toilet facilities were spotless, and all staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the TV room was our go to place with great selection of books and board games. Great variety of local bars , restaurants, coffee shops, nice parks all within a stone throw. Will not hesitate to book St Athans Hotel on our next trip to London Really friendly, clean and welcoming hotel, and great value for money. Shared bathroom for solo room was clean and recently refurbished, water hot and plentiful. No breakfast, but great options nearby. Perfect location. Taken one star off because the room I had was a little thin walled, and there was in addition a bit of street noise. If I'd remembered my earplugs I'd have got two excellent night's sleep. As it was I got one, and all of the other great things I've mentioned. I'll definitely go back. Stayed 1 night with 3 friends. On a tight budget but wanted a handy location and so pleased we booked st Athens. I like the detailed up front info on their website which you should read before booking as it won’t be suitable for everyone. This hotel has no lift and lots of stairs, no tea / coffee, no breakfast and small rooms. They make this clear when booking and it wasn’t an issue for us. We were greeted by a friendly member of staff on arrival after 11pm. Check in was quick. I liked the feel of the place, felt safe and welcomed and there were interesting pieces all around to look at. We all shared a small room with 4 beds and had a small but clean and well functioning en suite. We were all so pleased how clean the place was and could tell it was well looked after. Beds and St Athans at 20 Tavistock Place London was great if you don't want to pay for a expensive hotel , room was small but adequate, helpful staff , good location , some restaurants in the area . Bus / transport close by , room was quite at night. Spent six comfortable  nights at St. Athans. Even during heat wave without air conditioning room T5 was pleasant. Large bathroom with good shower and otherwise plenty of room for my daughter and I. Situated steps from choice of great cafés, so didn’t lack for in-house breakfast. Welcome from Gana (sic?) was lovely and staff in general very pleasant. The Reception Office is treasure trove of travel artifacts. T5 is located two flights up, so one has to be prepared to carry luggage but wasn’t an issue for me. The rooms on first floor look pleasant but can’t speak from firsthand experience. There’s a lobby area with lending library and guidebooks. Look for the custom typed notes by innkeeper in laminated folders under coffee table. The notes of neighborhood and sites are very AVOID AVOID  He is vulnerable adult who is registered disabled. He was going to an event in London and booked this hotel. On arrival he is told that they have over booked and just cancelled his booking and told him he will be refunded within 12:days. He was left stranded and wet and cold in the middle of London 4 hours train ride from home. Luckily after searching and searching my end I managed to find him somewhere and he arrived there at 9pm. All they offered him was £5 to get a drink. He has to use money he had taken to spend at the event for another room. This hotel needs to be avoided at all costs!!!! AVOID AVOID  The room was clean however the carpets didn’t smell great 😞 Sadly not for us, the rooms are very small and bathroom is tiny, rooms right on the road and I felt some what unsafe with unsavoury characters hanging around the road. It’s a very very old building. This hotel was a terrific choice. VERY convenient and close to everything. Location was great, especially for travelers on a budget.  As mentioned in other reviews there are LOTS of stairs. If you have trouble with stairs, I would choose a different location.  Also, yes, rooms are generally small. But in London, for the price, it is just right. We had a room with a private bathroom.  it was quirky (we had to go up a couple of stairs from our room to the bathroom) but charming.  The hotel is clean and super friendly.  We needed an early morning taxi and the front desk was amazingly helpful when we realized this late at night.  The front desk is always staffed and available to let you in or help with any issues. I would stay here again.  Super clean rooms/bathrooms, amazing staff. For travelers on a budget, you truly cannot beat St. Athans. Great location - 3 minute walk from the Tube!  Hotel was staffed 24/7, and you had to buzz the front desk to get in. Really liked how secure they made it.   Overall, I would absolutely stay here again!  Excellent location, however, it all felt very cramped. The bathroom barely fits one person, and the hotel is not wheelchair accessible at all whatsoever. However, for the location, the price was very good. The friendliest hotel I’ve stayed in for some time.  The hotel is well looked after.  The owners seem to take great pride in their hotel.  The room was comfortable and spotlessly clean.  My room was on the top floor, which required climbing a steep staircase.  You need to be quite agile getting back and forth to the shared bathrooms.  However, I had a peaceful night’s sleep on both nights I stayed.  The shared bathrooms were well maintained and clean.  St Athans hotel is in a great location with good public transport links nearby (Euston station is a short walk).  There is a great choice of cafés and restaurants in the area.  My stay was great value for money. I stayed here for an overnight on the way back home. I checked in late and was met by a friendly receptionist, who checked me in quick and gave me my key.  My room was only a very basic room, just a  sink, chair and small desk with shared bathroom facilities, ideal for an overnighter. The bed was nice and comfortable, just what i needed. The main thing being the room and hotel was very clean. I had room 5 on the first floor, a single basic, although it was directly over the bright red signage outside, once the curtains were drawn, the room was fine. The only worry i felt was, it can get quite noisy outside which you can hear in the room as its not double glazed. Check out early the next morning was fine and the staff were friendly and attentive at all times. They do not do The hotel room was small, but clean and stylist.  We are a group of 5 with elderly, adults and a young kid.  Although the room was small, considreing the very competitive price and its location, I was more than satisfied with that.  The staff are friendly and flexible.  When I did my booking, I ordered a room of 4 people.  However, they allowed me to add 1 more person by paying extra during my check in as my friend would like to join my trip in London.  That helped us a lot as we enjoyed sticking together in the hotel room.  I will definitely revisit the hotel if there is a chance!  房間細小，但十分清潔，內裡設計也很「英式」。我們一行五人有老人家和小孩子，雖然房間細小，但考慮到價錢和地點，我們都十分滿意。員工非常友善。訂房時我們只訂了四人房，但在入住時，我朋友想加入我們的倫敦行，酒店亦通融只收費一點費用，就讓我朋友與我們同住一室。若果我能再到倫敦旅遊，絕對會再光顧這酒店。 Stayed overnight on the 23/12/22.  as it was our 50th wedding anniversary. Immediately upgraded to a suite when discovered why we we're there. Food, service, room in fact everything about our stay was excellent. Can't thank the staff enough, they made our special day even more so.  All our thanks Great location close to Kings Cross. Small and simple hotel without breakfast. Perfect if you're out and about and only using the hotel for sleeping. Room was small but clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I was travelling alone and came back late at night, area felt very safe. I will definitely come back if travelling under similar circumstances! Unfortunately I had not appreciated when booking that we shared a bathroom. We booked through Booking.com and it wasn’t mentioned on the confirmation that it was a shared bathroom so beware. We were sharing with two other rooms. The toilet was filthy on arrival and clearly not cleaned throughout the day/night. The bin was open and full. The shower was hot but the tray was blocked so feet were swimming in the water. It was not a double bed but a small double. The place is very dated. On the plus side the staff were pleasant enough and everything appeared clean with plenty of towels. The bed, whilst small, was reasonably comfortable. There is no TV in the room or tea/coffee making facilities. This hotel is super-conveniently located in a very vibrant, youthful part of London, walking distance to several tube stops and steps from a bus that can take you right through London to the south bank! Many restaurants, cafes, and small museums surround the hotel also. It is charmingly decorated and staffed with friendly helpful folks. Be warned though, it is made up of several adjoining small hotels, build when humans were smaller. The halls and stairs are narrow, and the bathroom is shared. But the windows open, the bed was super comfortable and the decor lovely. And the price is very affordable. Highly recommend this hotel in Bloomsbury1 Stayed here recently with my daughter and will return when in london : no frills perhaps, but great location, comfy beds, modern private bathroom, and very friendly and helpful staff : this establishment is small and family owned, and it shows: they care! Stayed here for the night with my 2 daughters, beds were very comfy, shower was good, room was clean, staff were friendly and we felt safe. Would recommend to friends and would definitely stay again. It is positioned with plenty around and easy to find.  This charming hotel is in a great location near Russell Square, with an underground station nearby. The family room was nice and clean, but very cramped. Two adults in a bed a little over a meter wide, is simply not doable. My husband (2 m tall) had to switch with one of the kids in the bunkbed to get a decent night's sleep. The en suite bathroom is also tiny. But the room was quiet, nicely furbished, and staff was very friendly and helpful. Stayed in an en suite(highly recommend), and it was like I had my own apartment, but came with the best customer service I’ve experienced in London. It was Clean, Comfortable, they were beyond accommodating can’t say enough. I was in London for a week stayed at multiple places whilst there at multiple price points, and this small family run hotel was the absolute of them all! This place has so many stairs it'll make your head spin. Have you ever been fully showered, walked downstairs, forgot something in your room, and then wanted to become a sweaty mess by the time you got back to your room? Well look no further. Oh but perhaps I'm just out of shape right? No I'm a daily runner, have been for a long time. There's no AC or method of cooling the rooms, or the whole hotel for that matter, and there is legitimately one power outlet in a room with 3-4 beds. The ceilings are so low anyone over 6 foot will nearly bump their head when standing up. The bathroom is shared, it's not clean. The rooms are not clean under the bed there's dust and plastic leftover from some other guest. As a person who travels for a living, you would think that the worst hotel I stayed here because it was rated very highly in cleanliness in the reviews.  I will say that the shower and sink were very clean, but The sheets had not been changed after the last guest. I saw an obvious smudge on the sheet that was not a stain.  The young man who checked me in did not offer to help with my luggage at all, I am a gray haired woman, even up and down the stairs to the entrance. I also could not get my phone to charge at the only plug in the room (T 11) which i mentioned to them at check out. This location is ideal! Close to a tube station, great restaurants and cafes nearby.  The hotel itself is good.  The room was fine and it is a budget hotel. I did like that there are no keys to get into the hotel, it is locked at all times and staff will let you in.  That made us feel safe since there were more rooms than expected at this location. Just got back from an overnight family stay in a room with shared bathroom facilities. It is not the Ritz, but the price reflects this. What you get is quirky accommodation, that is very clean and has the comfiest hotel beds we have ever slept in! The staff were really friendly too. We would definitely consider if staying overnight again in London. Acted as the perfect base for our trip. Staff went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. Beds and room were very clean. Slept well.  Convenient location - very near Russell Square tube station and various coffee shops.  If you’re looking for somewhere cheap and simple but comfortable, this place is absolutely perfect.  Thank you St Athans Hotel, we will be back. Small but clean room. Can get a little loud outside at night. Bathroom located outside the room, but private. Staff is very friendly. No elevators available, so ask for a ground floor room if you're mobility-impaired or have heavy luggage.  I stayed for 3 nights at the St. Athans Hotel.  The shared bathroom situation was not a problem for me at any point during my stay.  There was a mini sink in my room as well that I used water/teeth brushing.  Also there are multiple bathrooms that you have access to.  I was pleasantly surprised at the amazing location of the hotel.  It is 1 block away from the Russel Street Underground station and definitely a walkable distance to SOHO.  I wished that my key card got me into the building but they have a buzzer and the front desk is manned 24 hours a day.  I got back one night at 2-2:30am rang the buzzer and someone was there in a few seconds.  I have already and will continue to recommend this place to anyone looking for a decent place to stay. Unfortunately  my husband and I tested positive for covid and are due to stay at this hotel on Friday. We had hoped to get a refund so that we could book again when we were well but I appreciate that we didn’t choose the free cancellation option when booking. Hopefully the hotel’s  other customers will not mind us staying whilst we are both positive with covid. Just in case anyone is staying  who may have an underlying health condition I’m posting in case you want to consider using your  free cancellation option rather than risk coming into contact with us during your stay. For the central location ethos is a great valued place to stay.   Close to Kings Cross, St Pancras and Euston and lots of underground stations, making it easy to visit anywhere you want to visit.  Signing in and out we’re very easy to do and the staff friendly. Fine hotel - single with private bathroom. I didn’t try breakfast. I missed toiletries - didn’t pack shampoo or soap as used to getting it. Would be nice to have a dispenser. Other than that, all great. Bed was comfy, radiator worked (which is amazing!) Fantastic friendly hotel in a brilliant location. Spotlessly clean and helpful lovely staff.  Everyone working here is so accommodating from letting us leave our bags before and after check to showing us exactly where to go and giving us maps. For central London this is a great find at a great price and I'd definitely recommend it.  Really welcoming and friendly place. They found me a tiny desk for my small room as I was working remotely, and helped me print travel documents. Common areas are cozy, and the location is great. Great deal for the price. I can't speak highly enough of St. Athans Hotel. In late September, I moved to London for a university program and due to the lack of available housing, I ended up spending several weeks here. For anyone looking for a place to stay in central London with the friendliest staff around, this is it.  To begin with, St. Athans is the best choice for those looking to stay in an ideal location on a budget. I was originally staying with another nearby hotel but the price was unaffordable so I made the move to St. Athans. It's just seconds away from cozy pubs, coffee shops, parks, and restaurants as well as being around the corner from a large shopping center with multiple grocery stores, pharmacies, and more restaurants. You're within easy walking distance (under 30 minutes, some as After doing a lot of looking online, we decided to stay  here as it looked pleasant. However, it wasn't as good as it looked online. If you're someone looking for a last minute stay and you're not bothered about cleanliness etc then this is for you. However, it certainly wasn't for us.  When we arrived we were greeted by two lovely ladies, we filled out the relevant information for Covid (However, it seemed like a lot of unnecessary information that they wanted compared to other places). We were then shown to our room, by a new lady who didn't know where she was going so we went the wrong way a few times, which is fine as everyone has to start somewhere.  The stair cases and the corridor outside our room had a horrible smell, but luckily it wasn't in our room. Then we come to This hotel was what it says on the tin, just what you need. Slight confusion at first as my room was a few doors down from the main reception building, but still close. Room was basic in some ways but for the good price I could not complain about my stay here.  My single room had TV, shower, storage, and I had a comfortable sleep. It was 5 minutes walk away from Russell Square station and approx 10 from Kings Cross station. The man at reception was helpful and friendly. In a nutshell I would stay here again :) Great staff, special Remo was very welcoming. I really recommend to stay here, as also the rooms are very lovely.  Also the location is perfect located in the central, and surrounded by a lot of coffee shops and restaurants. 12 minutes away from King cross station  Destiny Truly great experience  the receptionist was extremely welcoming and made us feel like home I would recommend this to anyone who decides to stay in london this experience would be one to remember for a while , Thanks again Remo :) Kind regards Arun Stayed here with my wife and 2 young kids at the end of July. The atmosphere was very calm and peaceful. Staff very helpful and generous with their time. They treated us as grown ups. That sounds quite a banal thing to say but not every hotel does this. Those that do, like some of the Premier Inns I've been in, tend to be quite functional in his they relate to their guests. St. Athan's is not like this. The vibe is warm and friendly and they make you feel like you're really welcome. A very nice building too and a top-class location as well, of course.\"},\n",

Location is fantastic, centralized and access to all turístic places. Room was comfortable and clean. Great experience Margaritaville Resort Times Square is a tropical enclave that brings a beach vibe to the heart of Manhattan. The property features 234 rooms, 5 restaurant and bars, a year round outdoor heated pool, a fitness centre and a retail store. It is a hop-skip-and-a-jump from attractions the likes of Broadway, Central Park and the Empire State Building.  I enjoyed my premium king suite with floor to ceiling windows and separate living area with spacious footprint. Design touches included a seaside colour palate and sound proof windows to deafen the noise of NYC. The chamber was well endowed with high-tech room appliances and the bathroom was equipped with a walk-in rain shower.  The Margaritaville Restaurant features NYC largest Tiki Bar and a 32 foot replica of The Statue of Liberty I was in town for 11 days. The staff at the front desk which included Ismar (especially!), Valentina, Julian and Jhona worked hard to accommodate all of my needs including the juggling of additional and different room types. thank you guys, you are the best. This continues for me to be the best mid town manhattan hotel experience. feels like home and clean and safe. and in the center of the action! thank you! see you soon, ellyn I stay here all the time. For business and personal and always have a great experience with phenomenal service and hospitality.  Today was by far the best. I checked-in very early…10am! Not expecting to be able to be given a room, I checked-in the standard way and did not ask for any special accommodations to get an earlier room knowing the hotel is sold out due to NRF. But Jhona and Valentyna instantly recognized me from my previous stays and noticed I was a bit run down from my travels. So they took it upon themselves to get me into a room by 10:30am. Unbelievably hospitable, kind and professional. They have always been so welcoming during my previous stays, but today they went above and beyond! This is by far my favorite hotel in New York City and I have stayed at almost 25 We loved the resort and will absolutely stay again next time we are in NYC. The rooms are small, but it’s New York! There is not ice on every floor, just the lobby. Staff was good, we traveled with a one year old and the hotel provided a pack and play which is always helpful. 10/10 recommend The location is great - it's just a short walk to Times Square, but in term of New Year countdown, the hotel was behind the ball drop and the performance stages. At the roof top bar, there was nice view of the surrounding area. We tried to store our luggage a few days in advance before check-in, and the request was declined. When we checked in and during our stay, we didn't find the staff at the Reception particularly friendly nor helpful. We booked a deluxe quadruple room in March for Dec / Jan, but found the room really small and expensive. There were other alternatives but we thought a quadruple room in a relatively new hotel close to Times Square will be a good idea. The hotel and rooms were decorated like a beach resort. Our room cannot see Times Square but had good view of Very nice place, big rooms and very nice staff that was always there for us! Breakfast was delicious with great variety of food! Great location very close to a few highlights! We will come back for our next trip in NY. We just hope to meet all you guys A resort in the true sense of the name.  4 restaurants/bars to keep all entertained.  Heated pool, rooftop bar, efficient elevators, happy staff.  Loved the small details in the rooms.  Breakfast at Margaritaville restaurant (floor 2) very good.  Nice gift shop for all of your JB souvenirs. Very clean hotel. Wonderful location! Upgraded our room premium upon request. Ismar and Julian were super nice and accommodating. Awesome view of the city right in the heart of it all. We really enjoyed our corner room and view of Times Square. Everyone on the staff was absolutely fantastic. Valentina, Tiffany, Ismor, Marlop. Thank you. But truly Everyone was great.  Every hotel has added this resort fee to their charges. The margaritaville adds the real resort feel. Truly a great stay we even extended. Can't leave without saying I think the great late Jimmy Buffet would be proud. This was our first time staying at this hotel and I would highly recommend it. It is in a central location in Times Square. I have never encountered a friendlier staff! Everyone went of their way to say hello, or offer a complimentary bottle of water.  Tiffany, Kiki and KT were at the desk when we checked out. KT found out it was our first time and thoughtfully gave my daughter a box of chocolate. The rooms are brightly lit, like new, and very clean. Our room was not large - similar to the size of a room on a cruise ship- but that is to be expected in the city for the price we paid and the fantastic location. I would definitely come back. Overall, I can't fault the hotel and staff. Impeccable service from arrival until departure. A special thanks to Kalsang at the front desk for his help. Also, please try the Nachos, amazing! From Thomas & Eve. We had been looking forward to staying here since booking this trip in  April of 2023. My wife has never been to New York before.  I just wanted her to have a great experience. This place did not disappoint. Each bar/ restaurant has it's own experience. Great place for family and couples. The rooms are on the small side but  once you use the space in the rooms then you will be fine. We used the drawers and closet space. Then you have space on the  top shelf of the closet to put away the luggage. Then you have plenty room to move around the space. Very clean rooms and love the service of the hotel, staff are amazing.  You could just call the housekeeping to get towels or whatever you need. Highly recommend going to the Time Square location. It's literally close to everything Great room! It was spotless when we arrived. Early check in went perfect! great staff (Tiffany, Damian, Ismar) were very pleasant and helpful! great food! We ate at Margaritaville restaurant and our apps and food were delicious!  The accommodation was absolutely perfect. The hotel is perfectly located and hosts are amazing. Kalsang was very helpful to us. Thank you 🙏🏼  Will definitely return, loved being in the center and accomodated perfectly. Thank you again! The front desk staff was amazing! Shout out to Jhona, Akilah, Troy and KT for helping my son and I get an upgraded room. It changed our entire trip! Thank you guys!  My only complaint about this resort is the elevators. They seem to take forever! KT, Jhona was extremely pleasant and helpful throughout our stay. We live in Florida and have stayed at several of your hotel there, our favorite is in Orlando. Being in Times Square, there is obviously a different vibe. Your staff, like KT made the stay that much better.  I stayed in this wonderful resort in mid-November 2023 with my husband, we stayed 5 nights. The room was beautiful and very clean with a breathtaking view of the Times Square skyscrapers. Cleaning was done every day and we had a coffee machine and fridge available. The beds and the pillows were very very comfortable .  In the building there are restaurants and bars where you can have a meal and have breakfast or just few good drinks.  There is a beautiful terrace with a swimming pool and a small shop selling very nice gadgets. The staff is always polite, kind, cheerful and smiling and always ready to help us and give us useful information. The resort is located right in the center of Times Square from where you can reach all the most important destinations and most famous places Wonderful experience at the Margaritaville Time Square. Great location, surrounded by theaters, restaurants and shopping. Friendly, knowledgeable staff made for a memorable first  trip to NYC. Shoutout to Ismar, Tiffany and Beni at the front desk!! I like this hotel and the service was really great, had a great time with a friend in NY city. The location is also good. but the room is queit to sleep. I am very sensitive to the voice but this hotel is what I would like to recommend if you want quiet experience. Jhona, Beni, Tiffany, and Nathan made our first Margaritaville Resort experience AMAZING. We were totally dressed in our best Parrothead outfits and lavished with compliments and excellent service (which i believe would've come outfits or not!). Made for a peaceful and stress free experience, especially for being in Times Square. So fun. And they even left us a birthday card! Johna at the front desk is the best she was so friendly to us and even greeted and interacted with our little boy who was thrilled. The champagne left in our room was amazing as well to have an extra little something  Valentina is very nice and very friendly. He goes above and beyond to help us. I would recommend for everyone for this hotel  Very clean and location is great. Right in time square. View is excellent.  There are several different restaurants I. The facility. It is convenient Johanna at the main desk check in was super helpful and friendly. She answered all our questions with a smile! The hotel was clean and everyone is so kind. Our room was small but we'll ladies out. We love the spacious shower. Overall a great NYC hotel room in the heart of theater  district My husband is a huge Jimmy Buffett fan, so this was especially enjoyable for him. Jimmy’s spirit is alive and well here, and we loved everything about the hotel, from the amazingly friendly staff to the cozy and comfy beach-themed room and the fun bars.  More specifically: The staff at street level are there to greet you and will direct you to the elevator (not the escalator!) which will take you to the lobby on the 7th floor. Our favorite “doorman” arranged in advance for a car to take us back to the airport ($65 cash to LGA before 11:00am). The housekeeping staff cleans the rooms daily and does a wonderful job. Any staff member who gets on the elevator is very friendly—one young man gave us four extra bottles of water. The rooms are small but cleverly designed to provide good I commend Ms Jhona from the front dest for her excellent service. She’s very accommodating, A lady of pleasant personality with a genuine smile to clients. She possesses a very helpful character trait and has the potential to see when things messed up like double booking and quickly she finds solutions. Clients like us are very satisfied with the service rendered to us by the staffs and the establishment. All of the staff go above and beyond to make you feel important. I did have a special staff member Kalsang, who achieved more than just personnel. He was very gracious and gave us good tips on directions and places to see. Kalsang allowed me to video him on how to get to the airport via subway and bus. He gave perfect details on how to get on subway and where to get off. During our stay, Kalsang would greet us and always asked if we needed anything or if he could be of assistance. Sweet man.  All the doormen were also very friendly. The rooms are kinda small but the linens are great. We only used the rooms to sleep in because we were on the go every day.  We also loved that Margaritaville is right in the heart of Times Square and many places we just walked. Would definitely Just returned from a 3-night stay at this hotel.  The room was small but very clean.  I loved the shower with the rainfall and there was no door (which was great as it was a beautifully tiled shower).  There were 3 of us.  The beds were double - so a little snug if you have to share with a friend.  The lobby is on the 7th floor.  There is a fun gift shop when you walk in.   The only thing that was frustrating were the elevators.  They were very slow and usually had a line no matter what time of day or evening.  The location is fantastic.  It is right near Times Square and  Bryant Park.  Also, Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall are only a 13- minute walk.  Highly recommend visiting The Edge NY - short walk , beautiful views and has a small glass area to see below.  The Pro(s): located in Times Square. Rooms are clean and modern.   Cons: $600 per night by the time you add the high “resort fees”.  Tiny rooms - queen size bed and you need to turn sideways to get around the bed.  There is nowhere to put your bag.  One bar of soap and two bottles of water… that’s it - nothing more in the room.  The elevators are a nightmare when they are even functional, and don’t bother complaining because the staff will just tell you “it’s busy” 🙄  You can skip leg day as you will be using the stairs.  The mini-Starbucks in the lobby, not open mid-day, you can’t even buy a water even though the staff is there.     Absolutely disappointed with this facility (“resort”).  Definitely not worth the money. Clean, friendly, perfect location. So many options in New York and Margaritaville is one of the good ones. Right in the mix of time square. Restaurant food could be better. Otherwise perfect stay for two adults and one kid  Close to time square, love the beachy theme. Staff (especially Tiffany and Valentyna) were super friendly. Room was clean, great decor and had large bathroom. We had a suite , 1 king and a pull out. Called housekeeping for extra sheets and they were delivered quickly. I love this environment almost staying here a year the hospitality is amazing and outstanding.the resort has stupendous customer service and knows how to deliver service The guest service Tiffany knows how to treat the guest and the bartender Alphonso makes the best drinks and knows how to treat the guest I recently returned from a two-day getaway at Margaritaville Resort Time Square.   The Positives: The hotel was impeccably clean and the staff provided exceptional service. The dining options were fantastic and the waitstaff was excellent. The rooms were also very clean and equipped with a large TV. The location is ideal for tourists, as many landmarks are within walking distance.  Negatives: The lobby is not located right at the entrance; you need to take an elevator to reach it. Once in the lobby, you will notice that it is quite small. Despite being advertised as a resort, it falls short of the expectations of someone who frequents resorts. The resort itself does not offer much to do apart from dining at the two restaurants. The small pool is closed during the winter. If you This was such a pleasant surprise. With the grumpy New Yorkers around every corner, we felt totally welcomed by the staff here. Every single staff member said hello and actually sounded genuine with their greetings. SUPER clean and comfortable.  This was a great hotel in Times Square and was near all the attractions.  We got there the afternoon of Santa Con which is the first Saturday of December.  Times Square was a mash pit of people and we will try to avoid this day in the future.  With that being said, Margaritaville Times Square was a perfect fit for us.  We stayed on the 16th floor and had easy access with the elevators and never needed to wait too long.  We were greeted by security every time we left and returned.  They helped us reserve there transportation back to the Newark airport for $95.  The front desk was very helpful and I’d like to say both Jhona and Kevin helped us with a few things we needed during our stay.   This hotel is clean and well maintained. Front desk is super welcoming and friendly. Jhona checked me in and she is absolutely wonderful and helpful! Having stayed here for work a few times, I asked for a quiet room on the 40th St side and she was able to accommodate my request. Seek her out if you ever have a question!  Personally I really dislike times square, but this hotel is across the street from the office so it's convenient for the work trips and easily accessible to a bunch of subways to get wherever you need. The fitness center is small and a bit outdated, but has the basic amenities. The only downside of this hotel are the elevators. There are a number of bars and restaurants throughout the hotel, and when there are events you can find yourself waiting for 15 minutes Overall it has been a great experience.    From check in to staff all was great.   We were able to check in early and its always nice to have a few comps fro drinks at the lobby bar.   Jhona and Valentyna were are great help.    I really was enjoying the whole ambience…. the room was spacious, the beds very comfortable and the decor perfectly fit the wonderful atmosphere.  Most impressive I found the staff awesome… everyone was helpful and pleasant and attentive.  My friends and I had the best stay! Attentive and professional service - front desk employees ( Akilah, Ismar, Valenryna, Jhona,  & Will) were informative and accommodating. We asked so many questions -  we got to know them pretty well! They pre-checked in our friends and were helpful in every way. Can't wait to come back! What a gem this place is! Margaritaville Times Square was an amazing choice to stay! Valentyna checked us in.. she was friendly, accommodating and personable. We went to the rooftop bar called five o’clock somewhere and the view was stunning, we saw the sunset and then headed down onto the  chill bar.. which was in the lobby where we checked in. This chill bar has an outdoor large terrace overlooking the outdoor pool!! Jhona and Akilah at the front desk were super sweet  and answered all our questions about  Margaritaville. The rooms are spacious and beds are sooo comfortable! Would recommend family and friends!!  Will and Ismar were a great help with all our requests during our stay! We can’t wait to come back!! Great location!\"},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': 'Moxy Times Square always accommodates your needs. It is always a pleasure to stay here and is my go to when going to New York. In such a convenient area and the staff is great. The whole ambiance of the hotel is super chic. The bar and restaurants attached are amazing as well. Just planned a short trip to NYC to celebrate my birthday staying at the Moxy Times Square. My expectations were huge once is such an important day. From checking in to checking out (and after!) I felt such an incredible experience and the service was no more than fabulous! Amazing structure, room cleaning just perfect, delicious food and the hotel crew… they are the best!  The bar on the second floor is awesome if you want to chill and enjoy some beverage, food and music.  The magic hour is just a spot you must go to fell what a party in NYC truly is.  Would definitely come back!!! I am a loyal Marriott customer and have stayed at many many different Marriott brands throughout my travels. This was probably one of my worst experiences.  This hotel did not represent the brand in a positive manner.  We had to change rooms three times.  Our first room was way too small for four people so they changed us to a slightly bigger room.    The second rooms AC did not work and there was no way to turn the heat down.   The heat was blasting the entire night and we were sweating and couldn’t sleep.  The next morning we called to let them know. They sent up an engineer but he couldn’t fix it. At this point I asked to talk to the manager.  He had told us he would change our room and give us a call to let us know what happened and what our new room number would be, but he The Moxy Times Square is in a great location.  Close to the usual time square attractions as well as great restaurants (Koreatown spots, shopping, etc.)  The 2nd floor bar and lounge is a great area to meet with clients or employees with ample seating as well as separate work areas that can be closed off.  The lounge gets a little loud at 4-4;30 PM, a perfect excuse to finish up work and enjoy the setting with an appetizer and an adult beverage.  The rooms are comfortable and very clean.  The real standout is the staff.  They are friendly and accommodating and make the stay special.  For those who like to run outside, you are about a mile from the Hudson and a mile from Central Park, so ~10 minutes and you can have a safer running setting.  The only complaint I have - not the Nelly was absolutely amazing! They were patient and knowledgeable and wonderful:) I really like that the hotel has so many food and bar options. Phenomenal amenities for the price. The hotel is really cool and I will definitely be staying here and other Moxy’s in the future. Letty and Gio saved the day! I used points and the rooms where a little different that I thought. When I made a small comment, Letty upgraded me (for free!) to a massive suite! The customer service here is the best I\\'ve ever received, and I stay at a lot of Marriott hotels. Their care and attention  makes the hotel feel like a home away from home. Thank you Letty and Gio!! Letty was hands down the BEST check in hostess that I have ever experienced!! she honestly made our experience amazing and every time we walked in the lobby she remembered who we were and greeted us with such positivity!! Hotel is in a great location. Room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The best thing about this hotel was the staff with Letty being an absolute standout!!!! Give her a raise NOW. Overall very friendly staff throughout the hotel. I give it a 4 because the rooms are so small. Exceptional service from David S. upon check in! He went above and beyond to make our stay special! He was so friendly and provided complimentary upgrades, and was very kind to help my colleague and me with everything we needed. The hotel was trendy and fun and great location! Great place loved the bed pillows they were very comfortable the service was great. They gave me plenty of great tips and spots to see. I truly loved my stay here with moxy it was. This place was great and the people serving me were unbelievable. Steve was great help!! The Moxy has a definite vibe; think shabby chic loft.  it is also what i would describe as minimalist.  I think they are trying too hard with being trendy.  It\\'s not bad, just not great for what you pay.  Of course, you are paying for location.  We stayed at this hotel because my husband had a conference and this was the company\\'s choice for a hotel.  we added a few days ahead of the conference to make a fun weekend in NYC and he did not want to change hotels.  Check in was fine.  We had reserved a king corner room, which was an upgrade from the standard rooms.  the images online made it appear MUCH larger than it was.  basically a postage stamp size room with a king bed shoved up against one wall.  which meant the person on the inside would have to climb over the other person Letty was an amazing and a bright energy during our stay! She made everything more enjoyable and was very helpful! We will definitely return, the space was clean and trendy in a vibrant part of town. Letty was helpful with where to go and what to do! The perfect place from which to explore NYC Very comfortable and warm room. Plenty of electric sockets to charge my devices and work with my laptop. Great TV and really excellent hot shower, so easy to use. Our Check in Staff MR. David was excellent. He gave a mini tour of the hotel too. The hotel is very central within easy reach of shops, eating places and metro, trams, buses and the Central Station. I will certainly be back.\" If you are a Marriott member, I do not recommend this hotel. It will be a poor use of points. If you are a young person who is just looking for a crash pad with no comforts and poor service, then this place will be fine.  Pros: Location Units are well-decorated Cheaper than other hotels we stayed at, so budget price but at cost of quality  Cons: ~Poor, poor customer service; we were told conflicting things by multiple staff setting us up to have a pretty aggravating night. Were not told where the lobby was to wait for a room. Staff from top to bottom treated us poorly. At one point, a hallway employee who guides you to/from the restaurant ushered us outside, thinking we weren\\'t hotel guests. Literally yelled, \"No, go outside through the hall\"?????  ~Have to go to the lower level Steven from Moxy Times Square assisted me in a timely manner. He acknowledged my platinum status by offering the services and perks as a platinum member. He accommodated me with an early check-in and extended my check-out time. I’ve stayed at this property in this past and Steven made sure to welcome me back. He was personable and friendly.  It was a seamless experience overall and Steven was pro-active the entire time. We were delighted to be greeted with the kind staff at the front. Carl was the one to check us in and he was very accommodating and extremely personable. he made sure our needs were met and our comfort was his first priority. I’m grateful we were taken care of, and we truly hope to have that same experience again.  Must visit! This hotel is not only in the perfect place in manhattan but the customer service is top notch. My hubby and I travelled alone for the first time in a long time (we have 4 kids). We had a couple hiccups when we arrived but Nico was AMAZING! He made sure our stay was absolutely perfect and that we would relax without hesitation. I highly recommend staying here. We will be back again with the family for sure. Special Thanks to Nico for making our stay a perfect getaway from our busy life.  The rooms are perfect; beds are extremely comfortable; loved the vibe and location of the hotel, the GM Kevin was so warm, welcoming and extremely professional - I felt like he was like the mayor - he offered us personal assistance and suggestions- was so surprise he gave us such amazing treatment - we are just guests. Staff was great! Eddie made sure our experience was first class. The location of the Hotel is also a plus. Many interesting sites to visit within a 15 min walk. I highly recommend staying at the Moxy when you are in NYC. Let me say that Letty,Gio & David. Made my stay at the moxy best experience I ever had.they ask me if I need anything while I was at the stay.key  pointed me to different areas in the build for me and my partner to do and also show me the transportation that’s near the area.greeted me at the moment I walk in the door and took care of me in the most kindest matter..I will definitely come back we need more people like this.  Absolutely fabulous hotel the customer service is fantastic from booking hotel earlier in year to emailing them about my daughter\\'s 18th birthday whilst on holiday in NYC. When we arrived our room was decorated with balloons and banners so thoughtful. Staff are very helpful on reception and in the bar.  The location is fantastic for Times Square and the subway. Thankyou for making our stay so special 💓  First time in NYC and always have been a huge fan of the Moxy hotel business. When arriving did not realize how small one of the rooms that we booked was. However when we asked the front desk if they could upgrade our room. Carl and Letti really came through for both me and my wife to make sure our New York experience was magnificent. They were exceptional . They were able to get us a room within minutes and were so kind and friendly. Me and my wife were so delighted and really appreciated them. The hotel is beautiful and relaxing. You must stay here when visiting New York!!!  Hotel experience is great. Neat and tidy hotel & room.   Also, and more important: Melany, the front desk clerk, was OUTSTANDING. I am so happy with all her help on my stay. I arrive after an 10hr trip and she goes above and beyond to assist on all my needs. I do recommend her to any other hotel guest that wants a great experience.  First time in New York City and definitely a great first interaction with Moxy! Steve checked us in and was wonderful. Helpful, gave recommendations, and helped us have a smooth transition. Loving Moxy!! The room was bigger than I expected, it’s perfect if you are traveling with a friend or solo! food and drinks at the hotel were also great and Steve at the front desk was such a great help with check in and all NYC recommendations! We didn’t realize how small the double room was when we initially booked. After we checked in, we realized we needed more space (I have a lot of luggage and need separate space to get ready). Cat and Letty were both so helpful and happily accommodated to help us have a fun, comfortable stay. They worked together and quickly found us a larger room to upgrade to. We are so happy with our new room. Thanks Cat and Letty, see you next time :) Steve was super helpful, kind, and informative! Hotel is nice and clean and an overall a great spot! Bar is great, and overall great location. Will for sure come back here when I come visit again. Thanks! Steve was a great help! He showed us around and was so kind! When we came in he was super friendly and helped us with ideas of what to do around Times Square and in the city! Definitely recommend the moxy!!  Outstanding stay at Moxy Times Square! Exceptional service, beautiful hotel, and Carolyn resolved issues promptly. A perfect choice for a place to stay in NYC! The hotel is really accessible. Can\\'t wait to return!  Carolyn was amazing and the hotel was beautiful. All the staff was very knowledgable. There was a bit of a hiccup in my reservation and carolyn took care of that immediately. Definitely would stay here again! This is in a great location in Times Square.  We arrived late in the evening and the customer service during checkin & checkout was poor. There was little conversation or even a smile.   This has fun, funky decor, the rooms are small but we were out n about during the day.  Out of the 3 queen with a loft bedrooms we had booked our room was slightly larger than the other 2 rooms and this was definitely better.   Rooms would be better fitted with a small fridge but the shower pressure was amazing and beds were comfortable.    You do hear street noise and noise from the room next door, however this didn’t impact us a great deal.   Several evenings we had drinks at Bar Moxy and the service from the bar staff was appalling.  I don’t think they even bothered to make eye contact!   You This was a girls trip for my 15 yo daughter and I.   We couldn’t have had a better experience.   The vibe was young and awesome.    I was especially pleased with the following: Engagement upon arrival from staff - when we were checking out luggage so we could walk around, a gentleman with a wagon full of drinks on ice offered us free water and soda Communication - I frequently communicated with the front desk via the chat feature in the Bonvoy app.  It was so fast and efficient Door manager - we had a wonderful experience with Giovanny.  He made sure we always had everything we needed and provided great suggestions and directions for getting the most out of our stay. Vibe - lots of photo worthy spots  and really enjoyed the dj in the Moxy Bar/Lounge  Thanks again for a wonderful An amazing hotel with fast check-in.  The room is perfect as announced on the website.  A place to stay when visiting NYC. We thank Melany for her help during our stay.  We fully recommend this hotel  Stayed at the Moxy for a business trip and could not have asked for better service.  Letty and Giovanny were absolutely amazing!!!!  They were so helpful!!!  Will definitley stay here the next time I am in town! Myself and my Husband stayed at Moxy for Christmas.   First impressions when we arrived is that this was a very popular hotel. We were early to check in so were shown where we could leave our luggage.   The hotel is a great location for exploring Manhattan. We did a lot of walking ! Also very close to the subway so very easy to get around. We were given a more spacious room due to the length of our stay but I think if we were return to NY we would stay elsewhere.  Whilst the room was clean and adequate for what we wanted there was a lot of noise from the street and the walls were quite thin so could hear noise from other guests. The room itself was quite small however was big enough for the 2 of us. Bathroom was nice and clean and the rainfall shower was amazing. The room was From the moment we arrived we were lucky to have letty assist us. Her vibe and charisma made us feel like we were family. She made sure she gave us a nice and spacious room and she learned our names. Every time she saw us she would ask us how our day went and always asked if we needed anything. Will definitely be back and will definitely recommend all because of letty. She’s a true gem. Thank you!!  The Moxy team was awesome Letty helped make our stay and our trip so amazing she gave us great suggestions on where to go and helped us with amazing restaurants picks as well! I will most definitely recommend and will most definitely return back to the Moxy in the near future!  We loved the whole experience. I am a single mom of a 17 & 15 year old. We stayed in the room with the bunk. Every night felt like a sleepover and we loved that. Having the sink outside of the bathroom was very convenient and a full length mirror!! Those can be hard to come by in hotels. It was very clean and comfortable. The staff was top notch. They went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and our needs were met. I want to give special attention to Letty. She is truly a gem of a human. I felt very overwhelmed when we checked in and she all but held my hand to make sure I was comfortable and ready to enjoy my trip. She greeted us like we were family when we walked in the front door every night. She even recommended what ended up being our favorite meal of the The staff went well out of their way to accommodate my family! Shoutout to the entire team- Nelly, Steve and Letty! Amazing service amazing hotel!        The hotel was clean and perfect location to everything in the city!   Letty at the front desk was amazing. She took great care of me and my brother. And, she’s got a great personality as well. She took our bags before checkin so we didn’t have to carry them around the city, big help! Professional staff, cool vibe, nice room.

Shalim, our server made my daughter’s birthday so special by bringing out a piece of chocolate mousse cake and singing to her! This is the type of experience money can’t buy. It is worth every penny, and even more. It is an experience that is out of this world!  I have a younger brother with Autism Spectrum Disorder who is mostly nonverbal, and the staff went out of their way to attend to his every wants and needs, interact with him, and make him feel special. This right here is the reason why my family and I will be coming back as often as we can. Excellent afternoon high tea with Fariz! I brought my parents and they loved it. The dining room is formal yet bright and casual, and the tea treats were so yummy and different from each other. Our waiter Fariz was so kind and helpful- he really made the experience more memorable. Thank you for the great time. A wonderful bucket list experience. While the surroundings are indeed amazing, that really is what you pay for. The sandwich’s and desserts  were outstanding but such tiny portions. I am willing to overlook this to say I finally had afternoon tea at the Plaza hotel. Porfirio was a wonderful server, I’d be happy to see him should I visit again. Fariz was absolutely amazing. Always attentive to our needs. We were served delicious tea. About 20 different teas to choose from. I choose the tropical tea. It was delicious. The fingers were delightful. The only one I didn\\'t like was the caviar macron The service and food was amazing- we highly recommend Fariz Tello. He is wonderful and very kind. We really loved the mango coconut tart- it was very delicious and sweet, and it was also very tangy. It was a great experience and I would love to come again. We had a wonderful time at the Palm Court for high tea. We took our two children, 7 and 10, and our server Fariz was amazing, going above and beyond to make it a magical experience for all. Highly recommend! Our waiter Fariz was amazing and showed top tier hospitality. The service was amazing and we felt very special and valued :) definitely coming back. It was such a treat! I reccomend this place to anyone! Definitely got the bang for the buck :) The Palm Court tea at the Plaza is pricey but very worth it. It\\'s absolutely lovely location and the transition in the evening makes it more magical. The tea was fragrant and delicious. My partner is celiac and they were incredibly attentive, never felt rushed, and the gluten free food was tasty with variety.  The service was impeccable. Warm without being intrusive, friendly, attentive, and an absolute delight. Ask for Fariz Tello to attend your table.  100 stars for him.   I am definitely coming back and bringing my friends here. Amazing tea! The service was extraordinary (Ask for Fariz- the kindest and most welcoming server I\\'ve ever had!) The gluten free tea was amazing and I didn\\'t feel like I was missing out on anything even though my partner had regular tea! Our daughters took us to The Plaza for afternoon tea. We had an amazing experience! Our waiter, Ferize was so informative and so incredibly kind. He actually made the experience. He made the experience very so fabulous for our daughters. Provided extra champagne. Had us try a special tea \"on the  house\". Had us sing Happy  Birthday to Eloise with a special cake and candle!! He made us feel so comfortable. Fabulous experience because of Ferize!! Our experience at the Palm Court for afternoon tea was fabulous because of the service provided by our server, Fariz. He was incredibly attentive, provided excellent recommendations and when he heard we were treated our mothers to tea, made them feel incredibly special. The food and tea was delicious but the experience was truly made by the service provided by Fariz. expensive but worth it. one  of a kind ambiance, amazing food, perfect tea, excellent champagne…the best part of the experience was our server Fariz who was so attentive and friendly. will be back to the Plaza for tea as soon as possible! i love new york I attended the Afternoon Tea at the Plaza Hotel with my 3 daughters. We were served in the Palm Court and the service was impeccable. Fariz went out of his way to ensure that the 4 of us had a delightful experience. We appreciate the attention to every detail. I would recommend this experience. We had afternoon tea at the Plaza Hotel. Porfirio Cortes was a wonderful waiter. Made our afternoon tea very so enjoyable. The Chai tea was delicious. Beautiful hotel and must do in NYC. In a beautiful location near Central Park. Even walking around the hotel was nice. Let me preface this by saying that I think everyone should experience the Plaza if they can. HOWEVER, I’m glad I had hotel points for this stay and did not use my own money. It would not have been worth it. The room was luxurious, and the butler/housekeeping service was excellent, but there were a lot of things wrong with our stay. First off, we had to check in late. They didn’t have our room ready on time, which was disappointing. Second, the room service (mind you for 2 people cost upwards of $120 for one meal) was served cold. It was not up to par with the food that I thought would be served. Third, when we left, I was not given my full deposit back. I was told when I called to verify that I was being charged for a meal that we did not order. All in all, it’s a nice hotel Nick and Russell are the BEST. What an amazing time at the champagne bar. The hospitality was second to none. They made us feel welcome and at home, even though we were just visiting from the street. We will never forget this experience.  Only reason for stars was fantastic server Fariz Tello and some food and  tea delicious. After being told they could accommodate food allergies upon making reservations, it was impossible to speak to anyone prior being told the server would handle. When arriving 1:00, it became apparent the whole dining room had same time. All servers had to take orders and get to the assembly line kitchen at the same time. The server said the kitchen would accommodate my allergies. I was served sandwiches appropriate for a kindergartner. And others at the table shorted their choices. If I could have had an appropriate conversation with someone prior, we all could have had a lovely lunch. I took my mother for her 79th birthday and my daughter to the plaza for tea. It was a fabulous experience. Fariz Tello’s service was amazing and he made my mother feel so special as we celebrated her birthday. It was the perfect setting for a special occasion. A first time afternoon tea at the plaza was a HIT! And on NYE of all days. Shalim was so attentive and helpful with everything that was served, and great at making suggestions of what tea we should try!   Highly recommend for any special occasion.   The ambiance is worth it alone, but the food and tea are also EXQUISITE!   Cannot wait to go back again.  AVOID the high tea at all costs.  Unless a tower of stale, low quality cakes and  sandwiches for $692 is your thing (family of 4) , then go right ahead.   Chef came out and checked the sandwiches, said they were fine, but brought out a bunch more stale sandwiches anyway.    Only ~10% of the items were edible,  and they didn’t comp anything except a single coke.  I very rarely review experiences on TripAdvisor,  happy to take the good with bad when traveling,  but felt I couldn’t let this Iet this pass without comment - as it felt like a huge grift. Tea at the plaza was simply divine. The delicacies of snacks and the delicious tea was wonderful. Our waiter, Porfirio, was most kind and gave us a very unique experience with his genuine care. My daughter and niece even enjoyed a special birthday treat. We thoroughly enjoy our time together.  Excellent service, delicious food at The Plaza New York.. Beautiful room, though scones could be larger.. Highly recommend reservations during holidays. Had a delightful day with my best friend. Will surely go back!  The stay was very nice but the things mentioned below were disappointing for the price we paid We called down for bellhop at approximately 11:15am  Waheed arrived and brought our bags down. We never received a ticket for baggage claim  We checked out gave in our parking ticket at approximately 12:15, took a brief walk in the park and came back. Our vehicle wasn’t pulled up yet so Ericka styles was called down to assist.  After 15 minutes she helped us get our own bags and we walked them outside to the curb Kevin then helped us and said our vehicle was on the corner of 58th in which is was not  He proceeded to walk us to the garage where the cars were parked. Kevin called someone and it was then reported our car was now in front of the hotel  Kevin was of great assistance and I had tea time at the Plaza with my daughter on Dec 14, 2023. It was Spencer Marie birthday. I have I was so impressed by the whole experience. The staff was really lovely and helpful especially Khalid Chowdhury. He was so generous with his time and service. I really enjoyed his stories. I would definitely go again. Fadiz was our server for tea at the plaza and he was the most kind, wonderful, and friendly person there. The food was delicious, the tea was hot, the Bellinis were decadent. I will definitely go back as soon as I can!  Service was excellent.  Food was very good.  I wish the scones were larger. Room was beautiful.  Highly recommend making a reservation well in advance around the holidays.  A fun day spent with my best friend.  Happy new year. I had such an amazing experience at the Palm Court restaurant in the Plaza Hotel. Our server, Fariz was awesome and extremely helpful. I came with some coworkers for afternoon tea and it was a great time. I will definitely be coming back. Thanks again Fariz! Love, love, love the Plaza, what is there not to like. Friendly staff, very comfortable rooms and a great location.  The afternoon tea is expensive but so worth it for such a great experience. On arrival We upgraded to a suite+ truly worth the extra cost.We will be going back! Our experience was great we\\'ve been wanting to come back for a while. The food was amazing and our server was our highlight. Shakil Khan was kind and very helpful. Will definitely come back for more.  really nice experience, the staff were so lovely and friendly. the room was gorgeous and very comfortable. the food was exquisite and the staff made sure everything was to your liking. the staff were also so helpful on organising events and helping us navigate around new york. i must also say that the staff member fairs tello was such a lovely person and was the best staff member i’ve met. 10/10 experience  We had a memorable life experience at the Plaza.  Tea with Porfirio Cortez was exceptional.  He is amazing at his job making each client feel special.  We will be back based on our lovely experience with Porfirio. Fariz Tello was wonderful service and polite.  My pleasure was so nice to hear.  The food was delicious.  Everything was slotless.  It felt like we were in a different country it was so beautiful.  Keep it up! My twin sister and I had the best experience for Afternoon Tea at the Plaza! Fariz was our server and he was OUTSTANDING. It was such a memorable experience and we will for sure be back and specifically ask for Fariz  I spent a few days at the Plaza on a business trip. I have only nice things to say about the hotel: nice and spacious room, friendly staff, great breakfast, beautiful hotel overall. I was looking forward to stay at this well-known hotel and it didn’t fall short on my expectations. Hoping to be back on a leisure trip. Came with the family to celebrate my wife’s masters degree. Shalim was amazing. He made sure we were all very well taken care of. Very kind person. The food was exquisite, the tea was phenomenal. Look forward to revisiting and hopefully we have Shalim as our server.  Excellent afternoon tea with delicious sandwiches, cakes etc. Our waiter, Mamun was very pleasant and helpful.       I asked for mint tea rather than Earl Grey but was told that it wasn’t available. Unusual not to be offended a choice.  The Plaza has iconic status in New York and therefore doesn\\'t have to try very hard to attract guests. Unfortunately the hotel owners have taken full advantage of that reputation and stopped trying many years ago and as a result the Plaza is extremely dated. Fixtures, fittings, decor and general upkeep have not been attended to for decades and the absence of any investment and there being no desire to deliver a quality experience is both obvious and shocking. It is a very tired and sad place that without its historic name would struggle to achieve even a 4 star rating. If it\\'s on your bucket list then stay one night, experience the frayed carpets, the doors that don\\'t fit properly, the waiting room that masquerades as  a tea room, the 19th century fittings and then move to a Superb hotel , amazing staff and wonderful food. Cannot wait to return. Ticked all the boxes. So close to all the major amenities inNYC. Loved the fresh smell of flowers in the hotel foyer. Beds were very comfortable. Cannot wait to return!! We visited the High Tea, and it was exquisite!! Fariz Tello took amazing care of us. This was a memory that will last a lifetime. The Holiday Tea had an essence of Christmas. The scones were my personal favorite. Christmas decorations adorned every corner. We hope to come back. Thank you Plaza! '},\n",

The only bad thing was that we had a little difficulty communicating with reception to ask for blankets, mainly but everything has already been resolved. This is my fifth time in this hotel with my husband, very nice to be back there. The receptionists are very attentive. I thank everyone there for their attention, Ana Rosário, Giovanni, Miguel and also the friendly Idris.  The breakfast has gluten-free bread, I just asked the very polite attendants Angelica and Elizabeth  bring it on my table. Many options of fruits and breads. The room always clean.I also really like the kitchenette, it makes it a lot easier. They take orders from Amazon.  I hope to be back soon. Thanks. We cannot say enough good things about the Homewood Suites Hilton on 37th St. The staff was friendly, helpful, and went beyond the call of duty whenever asked. The location is excellent  with plenty of restaurants and amenities nearby, and obviously close to tons of attractions. The breakfast was bountiful and delicious and the staff were friendly and efficient. The room was clean and comfortable. Shout out to Juan who helped make our stay more enjoyable and for managing a busy time with almost 1,000 guests. We recommend it. This hotel is in the perfect location if you are going to MSG. We loved our stay here, the room was very spacious and came with a full kitchenette. Breakfast area was super busy in the morning but had great options to choose from for breakfast. It was also great to have the opportunity to make coffee in the lobby all throughout the day. The staff texted me throughout my stay and made sure I was always taken care of. The front desk held our bags after checkout which allowed us to explore the city for a while before heading home. Parking garage was 300 feet away and made it extremely convenient when I picked this hotel. Would 100000% stay here again on all my future trips to NYC moving forward. Highly recommend! We had a great experience here! Rooms are clean and very spacious! We were in a double, and it even had a small kitchenette with a large fridge. Being a food allergy family, we like to bring our own food so it was nice having enough room for everything. The hotel also served a hot breakfast in the morning. There was plenty of food and more than enough options. There was also staff taking away plates as you finished with them. Felix especially was kind and helpful and made sure that we had everything we needed. I’d like to say a big thanks to Adriana and Oliver T.  For making each breakfast in the restaurant a fantastic moment to share with my kids. They were both so kind, helpful and joyful that I would definitely visit the hotel again. Very kind, friendly and helpful. It's lucky to come on a trip and meet people like that because they make the trip so much more enjoyable. The cleanliness of the whole hotel was very good. Jorge, Josttyn and Oliver are very good employees, I hope that their careers in this hotel will be long lasting. Overall room was very clean and spacious and the breakfast delivery was very well organized and had a wide variety of foods. The staff was very helpful when they you need assistance and were very friendly. I would like if you served the cookies more often as they were delicious!! The place is very warm and cozy! My, my wife and our little 20 months old baby felt immediately wellcomed. Once arrived my wife had an injury in her shoulder, reception supported us and helped us fixing the situation. A special thanks to Olivier T. that helped us during the trip making it more funny! And providing special advices :-) What a great hotel and location for families and a great location to explore the city as it is walking distance to many of the main attractions and Penn Station is only a short walk away. Staff were great and helpful. Breakfast had many hot and cold options and even supplied 'take out' boxes to fill up if you wanted to take anything extra for the day. The only negative thing I can say was there wasn't enough seating to have breakfast and had to stand to have our breakfast on the first morning. The positive was the next 2 mornings we were able to find a seat. We will definitely book this hotel again on our next visit to NYC and would recommend to families. The most enjoyable part of my stay was meeting Oliver T. He answered all my concerns and endured that the lobby area was at its best for all of us to experience.    The bathroom towel dispensers not working.  He stayed with the problem until it was resolved.  Oliver was very helpful and friendly. You can tell he loves working here. He made sure to take care of us and provided any service we may have needed with no questions asked. Would definitely recommend coming here.  We are delighted to have stayed at this hotel. we received a quality room and perfect service. Thanks to Josttyn for his good humor and his service at breakfast.  Good address, good experience, we recommend  Awesome service! We’ve gone to NYC just before or after Christmas (in other words, busy for hotels and other service industry) 3 times over the last 5 years and our hotel experience this time was by far the best. Everyone we encountered from front desk to lobby to breakfast area were polite and helpful. It was myself, my mom and my 15 year old son and we all want to especially acknowledge Jorge. Every morning without fail he was there with a smile, asking if we needed anything, answering questions and just being overall kind and helpful. Again- the front desk staff was great too! We will stay here again! Unfortunately when we arrived on 30th December 2023 late night to check out on 4th Jan 2024. They didn’t check us in straight away as they spent one hour thirty minutes trying to figure out if we made payment. Which I made full payment on booking .com for 2 no Efficiency king studios before I arrived. They were insisting that I make another payment of $1500 but I argued that $3558 had already left my account and demanded they called booking.com. Booking.com confirmed my payment and asked them to give me the  2no rooms I paid for. They only managed to give me one room I paid for and issued a lower grade room as the second room. On checking out they tried to charge my card which I asked them shouldn’t it be them refunding me the $100 they took during check in. Felix was very Excellent service and attention. The breakfast is too delicious and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. Jostty and Felix gived us a good service!!!   The hotel is in a good location close to anywhere and main tourist attractions. The hotel is gorge and very well located to everything we need. The rooms are spacious, comfortable, clean and beautiful!  There is a parking garage right across the street and Penn station is walking distance! The service was incredible, we were greeted at check in by the manager Jon Lomitola, who gave us a tour of the lobby AND a swag bag of great gifts!! We felt so welcomed and cared for. We can’t wait to go back!  Rooms were spacious and clean.  Location fantastic. Breakfast was awesome and Jostty our server was kind and enthusiastic about his job. He was very friendly and respectful. It was awesome. The breakfast was fantastic and the coffee great! Josttyn is the best, very kind and funny!!! We’ll return for sure, the hotel is top and the positions is fantastic. Breakfast is very very good and also the happy hour in the afternoon. Very silent during the night Brilliant hotel, right in the middle of New York attractions. This hotel is Situated 5mins walk to Port Authority Bus Station. You step out and turn right , walk a few yards and straight on to 8th Avenue. Carlos Bakery is less then 10 minute walk from the hotel. Very close to all shops. Eating out no problem. The hotel rooms were spacious with a little kitchen in it. Big fridge to store your left overs and keep water or drinks in. Breakfast was amazing. Did get busy often and finding a place to sit and eat was tricky. But was manageable. People even took pieces of food back into their rooms. The watermelon was a blast. Big sizes. Staff very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay in the same hotel if I ever went back to New York. Everyone was helpful when asking information about where to go and what to see in New York. They were also very good with refilling the coffee and cups in the rooms. Overall a good experience for my family’s first time in New York.  My family and I had a great experience at Homewood suites.  It was my wife’s first time in New York and the very helpful/ friendly staff made the trip a delight. Jorge was very friendly at breakfast!  The breafast was perfect and attention to the room cleaning was bar none but to top the stay was Karen who managed to find my old account and awarded us points for staying...Thanks Karen...keep on being awesome.  Very good attention, specially from Josttyn! Ideal place and excellent location, near Madison Square Garden and other touristic sights. Good breakfast and possibility to take it away. Coffe and tea all day long available. Comfortable rooms with fridge and mini kitchen.  Staff simply amazing - always available and eager to respond to our requests. In the mornings there was always a staff member walking around to check guests were pleased Central location, between 8th and 9th avenues, 15 min away from Times Square or 15min away from the Hudson river  Stay super relaxed with hot beverages available 24/7 which felt so good to have one, when arriving to the hotel from cold freezing weather outside :-D On breakfast, disposable card boxes were available to take all the food out we wanted with no questions asked or raised eyebrow  single minor remark goes to the refrigerator's noise over night which was to loud when someone is sleeping I couldn’t rate this hotel highly enough, clean , tidy everywhere ,  comfortable rooms . It’s  really well located , breakfast very nice and  good value , great staff who were all really helpful , cheerful and polite .  Loved the free tea and coffee  in the hotel reception area 24/7 . Very clean, location was great and convenient to subway. We stayed in a king studio suite which was located on the corner the room was very quiet and extremely clean. Three of us fit more than comfortably in the room. Overall we couldn’t ask for a better stay. The free breakfast was a bonus too! Nice clean hotel in a great location because it was quite central to everything.  Breakfast time busy but had everything you needed. Tea and coffee available all day. What makes this hotel is the staff. They where all lovely, friendly and helpful.  Thanks to Jorge and Felix for finding us a seat each morning at breakfast time. All the staff work hard and deserve a mention. Very good location and friendly staff. Breakfast can be a zoo due to high number of guests and the food is  average. Kitchenette in the room was very useful and it was pretty quiet given the location, which may have been because we were on a high floor.  Good place to stay in midtown Very comfortable room, excellent all included breakfast and friendly, helpful staff especially Juan. Traveled with my college aged children for our first visit to NYC. This location was great for sight seeing and subway travel.  We arrived at this hotel on December 11th at 12.30 in the afternoon.  The room wasn’t ready but was expected as check in isn’t until 16.00and it was very busy, so they kindly stored our baggage and told us to come back at 16.00. We arrived back at 16.30 but the room still wasn’t ready , was slightly disappointed as we had only come back to freshen up then go back out to explore, we waited 20 minutes then was given our room key.  On first glance of the room we thought it was quite small for 3 people with nowhere to place suitcases out of the way , but this didn’t really impacted us to much as we spent a very small amount of time in the room . Breakfast was very busy so we ended up getting a take out and taking it back to our room . Free tea and coffee in the lobby to help First time in NYC and have to say the location of this friendly hotel/suites is fantastic, the staff are very helpful. The young man on front reception [sorry didn`t get his name] took the time to write down our journeys through the subways which was very helpful to us both. Bed and pillows are very comfortable and a well equipped kitchen, tea and coffee available all day at reception. Jorge and Josttym and all the breakfast staff are very helpful and friendly. We would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again in the future and would recommend to friends and family.   Breakfast is great! Nice options and variety. Josttyn and the crew are so helpful and friendly. Rooms are big for New York City standards, but the sofa bed could be better. Shower is nice, but bathroom is bite-sized. Location is great, easy to get around. Would stay here again if in the area! Service at breakfast was good- even though space was limited, Josttyn made sure we had somewhere to sit and cleaned up for us so we were comfortable! He came a few times to check on us, and made sure we had everything we needed Josttyn is awesome!! He helped us in the breakfast and he is super helper. The breakfast is amazing too. The bedroom is super cozy. Me and my family felt welcomed by everyone ate Homewood by Hilton. I recommend! a really great hotel with kind and friendly staff , especially josttyn , he always greets us enthusiastically which makes my morning even better and he approaches us when we need help , thank you . the hotel has great facilities and it’s more convenient for tourist like me,will definitely stay in this hotel again  Great sized rooms for New York, kitchenette and bathroom really nice. Great location, walking distance to Penn station (5 mins) and Madison Square Garden. About 20 min walk to Radio City Hall and short stroll to Times Sq.  Breakfast was very good, but get there early (before 7) unless you like manoeuvring and fighting your way to the breakfast bar, jostling with overweight yokels loading their plates with enough food to sink the USS Enterprise, as if they were never going to see waffles and syrup again in their lives. Omelettes were good when they were  available, and not smothered in maple and stacked 10 high on Jabba the Hut's plate on the table behind you. I would stay here again in a heartbeat, but be prepared to get up early if you aren't keen on grappling for your morning During my recent trip to NYC, I stayed at the Homewood Suites Midtown/Times Square  Pros: 1. Great location on a quite block 8th/37th and close to both Herald Square and Times Square. (walkable) 2. Wednesday evening cocoa and hot soup reception  3. Customer Service: The ENTIRE staff from check in to check out (shout out to Juan) was great. Everyone was so helpful  4. Response to request: Room was not cleaned well, brought this issue up with the front staff, room was cleaned after check-in 5. Take out box for breakfast. Especially helpful since the hotel was full due to the holidays. This helped with congestion in the small lobby/eating area  Cons: 1. Cleanliness of rooms  2. Rooms are a bit worn 3. Small rooms (to be expected for NYC)  Overall - I would stay at this hotel again  It was a great place to stay, they took our bags early so we could spend some time exploring, the room was spacious with a kitchenette, and the staff was extremely friendly! Jorge especially was great during breakfast!  Amazing holiday experience! Pride in service shows from the moment you enter the lobby: gorgeous Xmas tree, clean space, superior evening social. Shout out to Karen, Donna, Sharlene, Jessica, Jackson, Pedro, Luis, Jorge, and Ana.\"},\n",

Our stay started off with a warm and friendly greeting from the staff at the front desk. Check in was easy and efficient. We found our room to be clean and comfortable- brand new! Quite beautiful. The view from our room as the sun was setting was spectacular! After an evening at the theatre ( highly recommend The Music Man!), the bar was open for a night cap. Breakfast was fresh and delicious served by more friendly staff. Our overall experience was exceptional! We’ll be back Having just returned from a trip to NYC, the MbH hotel has been a great place to stay. Situated close to Penn Station, Madison Square Gardens and also close to the subway makes it ideally positioned.  The hotel is a modern, clean, bright and vibrant hotel. The staff are courteous and ensured check in was fulfilled quickly. My request for a high room with a view was achieved with minimal fuss and what a view The 42nd floor view gives vista across Lower Manhatton. The room was well equipped with a large comfortable bed and modern shower. Thanks to everyone for your customer service  Phil ( Room 4201). Loved the use of space.. we could fit everything we needed in the storage under thr bed. We also and an amazing view. The beds were very comfortable and the showers were great. The restaurant was also really good and the staff were very friendly. We absolutely loved our stay at Motto. We stayed for Christmas and were sad to leave. The staff and atmosphere are extremely welcoming and the decor is very stylish and typically New York. A modern but authentic feel to our stay with fantastic location in the heart of Manhattan, between 6th and 7th Ave. Nearest subway at 23rd street just 1 block away too with various uptown and downtown routes. Check in and out was very easy though reception can get busy because the hotel is popular. However, there were always polite, helpful staff on hand. Free Wi-Fi worked everywhere in the hotel and rooms and premises were immaculately clean. Comfortable beds/pillows, plenty of charge points and mini fridge. Free water each day also. Room for a family of 4 is a little small and there\\'s no Tons of positives, a few negatives - overall, glad we stayed here. I\\'ll start with the positives:  the 2 bunk bed room was actually perfect for our family of 2 parents & 2 adult kids - each bed was comfortable, and I loved the little ledge where I could charge my phone. We thought the room was a fine size, and loved the hooks to put things on. The staff at the restuarant/bar were incredibly nice (my elderly mother was with me, and they exhibited such kindness towards her - it was amazing). The lounge was comfortable and a great place to hang out. The location was perfect, I\\'ve always loved Chelsea - you are near so many great places to eat and it isn\\'t as crazy as Times Square. The few cons were the front-desk staff (not helpful), the elevators (long waits), and it seemed like We booked this hotel due to the location which for our plans for NYC was perfect. This modern hotel is well appointed with excellent staff who were friendly efficient and helpful at all times. Rooms are compact but perfectly acceptable for NYC with good innovation and the best made of the availability space. Housekeeping was fully on point and diligent although the h/k staff kept forgetting to leave a spare toilet roll (biggest complaint which is nothing I know). Can’t recommend this place highly enough enough and would certainly return if back in NYC Good morning, I have been booking hotels through booking.com for many years. In addition, I have frequently booked business trip stays for my boss in the UN. What I never thus far encountered is an added fee, showing up out of nowhere! $ 35,— per night(!), no less! Upon my questioning this arbitrary ‚resort fee‘ the receptionist simply informed me that it was mandatory. In which case, it should have been included in the pricing, be it via booking.com or otherwise. This feels like a scam and  leaves a really bad taste. Needless to say, I will never book this hotel chain again. Local tax of a couple of dollars is one thing. A $ 35,— dollar hike per night, that the hotel chain is hiding, is quite another story. Came here for a spontaneous trip with my friends and they were more than accommodating, room service was very friendly it’s in a very convenient location where Times Square is easily accessible but you aren’t effected by the city noise great cafe in the lobby very clean and very modern quiet and easy to come and go uber pickups are simple plenty of good food in walking distance definitely worth every penny enjoy your stay. Motto was an outstanding choice for our long weekend in NY over Thanksgiving.  Our stunning view of lower Manhattan from the 42nd floor morning and night was the ultimate start and end to each day.  Thanks to the team at check in/out for their superlative hospitality and to the bar and restaurant team for their friendliness and top notch service at breakfast and at stops for a nightcap at the bar.  We\\'ll be back! Utterly stunning views from our 40th floor room, facing south across downtown. The view really made the stay and the trip for us! Rooms are comfortable and nicely decorated, though very small by US standards.   Main drawbacks for us was the destination fee - $30 a night with $10 credit to use in the hotel restaurant. I’d prefer just to have the $10 back instead as the credit doesn’t really cover anything at all in full other than a soda.   Worst thing is the elevator situation. While being high up is brilliant, at certain points it can take you a very long time to get up or down. Worst evening for us trying to go back up, we queued for 15 minutes just to get into an elevator and then another 5 as we stopped on multiple floors. If you need a quick entry or exit ask for a floor We spent a couple of days in New York and I must say the location of the hotel is just perfect! It\\'s close to a lot of tourists spots in the city, specifically the Chelsea Market, the Vessel, Hudson Yards, and and Madison Square Garden. It\\'s quite expensive though considering the size of the room. The lobby was small as well. However, our room exceptionally clean and a great view of NY skyline, and the staff were very accommodating. This hotel is clearly designed for the younger, hip crowd. The location in Chelsea is excellent for the Flat iron district and it is easy to hop on the nearby subway stops for most all other areas. The lobby/reception area is tiny and the waiting area is equally small. The space is primarily a very nice bar/lounge. Staff were friendly but not all that efficient for an older couple - no offer of help with luggage to a room, no notice on phone when our room was ready even thought it was ready. Tiny room with limited view, no closet but lots of hooks, a stool instead of a chair in the room and the sink in the room as the bathroom is so small. It was clean and convenient but definitely for the 30 and under crowd. This is my second stay. Hotel is very clean and quiet for sleeping. The location is excellent, nice part of Manhattan, walkable and easy public transport access.  The lobby is welcoming, nice vibe of folks. Shout out to the barista Brandon. Such a nice guy, I became an early morning regular and looked forward to his coffee and conversation.  I’m originally from NY and have come back to visit and tried various hotels for many years. This is the only one I will book moving forward! The service at this hotel is EXCEPTIONAL!!! The staff is lovely and helpful throughout the hotel. The staff at the restaurant need to be studied. They are top notch! Jamica, Meg, and Jack were consistent in extending care and kindness during each visit. They made excellent recommendations and didn\\'t mind my inquiries. In fact, the Beverage Director made an appearance to make recommendations and chatted with us as well.  The food is fantastic, the cocktails divine...10/10 would absolutely recommend!  I really love this hotel. The location is ideal, since it is roughly equidistant from Time Square or Chelsea market. I actually recommend Chelsea over the more touristy areas. The rooms are small, but we had a great room on the 36th floor. We were able to see all lower Manhattan down into NJ. The bed and pillows were great. The only downsides are: no coffee/tea in the room, no refrigerator, and the shower lost all hot water a couple times. The body wash and shampoo are really nice. Upgraded towels and amenities.   The front desk was great. The restaurant and bar are also wonderful. The hotel is quiet. I recommend the lobby on the second floor.   We would definitely return1 The bad:  staff were trying hard, friendly and rushing around, but couldn\\'t keep up.  Always long lines at desk.  Got us checked in an hour and a half late because short of cleaning help.   Took an hour to get our car on checkout though they\\'d said plan for max a half hour. And, yeah, we expected some junk fees.  But, hotel added on a $30 \"urban resort fee\" to the car valet charge!   Waived it as a \"one-time courtesy\" after I complained that my car didn\\'t use their wifi, gym, or such. The good:  great location.  Room was Manhattan-size but efficient, comfortable, clean.   Carolina Ballon, waitress in the bar is great. Ask for her if you drop in. She provides good recommendations, is prompt, and most pleasant. Check in was easy. Our room was ready on time. And for a standard king bed room it was fairly spacious. We’ve stayed here a number of times and will continue to do so. This hotel was AMAZINGGGG!!! So easy to book and check in.  They are very helpful and super accommodating especially for first time visitors to New York! I would definitely book with this hotel again should I make it back to New York again!!!! I have stayed 2 times in the past year at this hotel and would certainly stay again. I came for a business/couple trip and the events were held in the meatpacking area which are easily accessible by walk or short 10 min drive from hotel. Fouad and Ina are absolutely phenomenal and friendly. Both times they listened to my request and provided a room with spectacular views. Ina is super friendly and welcoming. Ask for her if you stay at this hotel and she\\'ll certainly do her best to exceed your expectations.  I’ve stayed at Motto a few times this past year and the staff and quality never disappoints. Best in the business friendly staff, comfy bed, modern room with a view. Sit at the bar for lunch - the bartenders are great for chats about the city.  East access location to all the city has to offer. The hotel is excellent and in a great location. Our flight arrived early morning and we went to drop bags with the hotel around 10am and they allowed us an early check in with no additional fees and gave us a room with a fantastic city view of downtown and One World Trade. The front desk was super helpful and got us squared away quickly. The man’s name was “Z” who helped us, and he is the epitome of what top rate customer service is supposed to be. Also enjoyed the bar where they make incredible cocktails and have a nice happy hour (4-7p) My stay at the Motto Hotel was a great experience. The location was perfect, we were walking distance to many attractions, restaurants, bars, stores, and theaters. The room was small but very accommodating to our needs, it was very clean and comfortable. The view was spectacular at night. They also have a restaurant downstairs in the lobby that has a great selection of food and drinks. The staff was welcoming and very attentive throughout my stay. i would definitely be returning to this hotel. Motto by Hilton New York City Chealsea - located in the heart of New york (NY) United State ..room rates $155  per night (USD) price match... Chealsea is a great area to stay.

This was the second time that I stayed at the Motto in Chelsea, and it has officially become my hotel of choice. The vibe is unpretentious and fun, the rooms are small but really smartly designed (and very comfortable), and the staff is super helpful. A special thanks to Caesar at the front desk for being so helpful. Muslim was able to help us and check us in early. Was very helpful and sweet. Quick check in and cared about our preference. Great experience and very accommodating. Hotel was nice and view was good.  Great location in the heart of the city. Beautiful modern, elegant efficient lobby with a bar an inviting bar & lounge area. The check in process was inviting quick and easy. Z who helped us was kind with excellent customer service with natural guest relations with attention to detail. He set the tone for the weekend. The room was modern clean with great lighting. Very comfortable & cozy. The only thing that I would say would be the quilt on the bed could’ve been a little thicker for winter. The view was the star. Floor to ceiling windows with city views wow. Stunning. Next time we had to the city we will definitely stay here again. I can\\'t say enough about the great stay we are having so far at the Motto.  Beautiful lobby and lounge (where I worked).  Had delicious chicken picotta in their restaurant for dinner with an arugula salad.  Most impressed by far though with the service.  Every person we have encountered so far has been top notch.  We received first class Diamond 💎 level service from Marissa and her front desk team of Ceasar and Natacha.  They went out of their way to reward our loyalty with a spectacular room on the 41st floor with a view of downtown.  Thanks Motto. Such a great stay and even better people! Our room had the most amazing view, room was so well kept, quick bights downstairs made it easy to stay. All of the staff were extremely helpful but one really stood out, Cesar. Thank you!   I’ve now stayed at Motto 4 times this year, my first experience great and it’s just more and more enjoyable every time I stay. The rooms are incredibly comfortable and have everything you require including a super comfy bed, ample sockets and plugs for charging and streaming option on the TV. The best part of Motto is Lulla!  Members of the team here have remembered me from former stays including one of the managers Alex. The food, service and range of drinks available is great which can’t be said for a lot of hotels and given the options on their doorstep this place does rank pretty high with locals and guests. Lastly the views from the room are quite possibly the best in NY! My partner and I decided to stay here for our anniversary because of the amazing location and the great views from the rooms. Let me let you this was the most perfect place for our anniversary!! The location was amazing, the staff I dealt with were so helpful and friendly, and since we reached out to let them know we were celebrating, they went above and beyond to make sure we felt extra special on our special day! Whenever I come to the city I will definitely be staying here. I will say it is definitely a couples/solo hotel. Although the rooms were not huge the amount of storage that was within the room made the room not feel crowded so it was perfect for the two of us. Have to add the shower pressure was AMAZING!!! The hotel is not fancy. The rooms are small. But (1) it\\'s clean; (2) it\\'s newish; (3) the staff is awesome! (4) it\\'s not crazy expensive considering you are in NYC.  It\\'s a 3-mile walk to  Central Park and NBC studios and all those fun holiday things, but there\\'s plenty to walk to within a shorter distance if you are just looking for a walk in New York\\'s fun filled evenings. I love New York and I take 6 to 8 mile walks every time I go there so staying here rather than my old favorite Hilton on the Avenue of the Americas has become a thing for me. I pack light -- nothing but a carry-on -- so I don\\'t need a closet. This hotel perfectly fits my needs.  Special Note:  the best thing about this hotel is the restaurant next door, which has become part of the hotel. The restaurant is Best hotel experience ever! I truly had such a wonderful time. We went with the city view and it did not disappoint. From check in to check out we had a simple and easy process. I also really appreciated that we could do an early check in and leave our bags and go out and about until our room was ready! We also received 2 free water bottles a day! I will absolutely be coming back to NYC in the future and I will make sure to always stay at this hotel. It was just overall such a great experience!  The hotel was amazing. Very nice and clean. Tons to do in the surrounding area!  We did a good tour, ate at some great restaurants, went in the summit and even a ghost tour. Everyone at the hotel was so friendly and I felt we could have stayed a month still not have done half of what there was to do in walking distance. And my name was even on the television to welcome me with water and cookies at the foot of the bed!  How can you go wrong?  The room is small but very functional.  Classic NYC economy of space.  Feels a bit cramped.  Problems with bathroom: shower temp up and down during my shower.  The door is hard to open and a young child might be trapped.  The staff are very friendly and helpful, a real plus. Positives: The location was very convenient and our room was clean with a beautiful city view, a comfortable bed and a good-sized shower. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, letting us check-in early and storing our luggage after checkout. We really appreciated that!  Negatives: The lack of soundproofing meant that we heard traffic noise even on one of the top floors. The loud AC and many flashing lights in our room made sleeping harder than it needed to be. The drinks/food were pricey and we’d have gone elsewhere had we not received a $10 food voucher. The good bits… 1. Location is brilliant. Chelsea is a good area. 2. Hotel is clean and has a decent bar. 3. Modern hotel, the views from our room were just breathtaking. 4. The hotel were fair with their compensation following the 2 fire alarms. The bad bits. 1. A strange welcome at check in. Never experienced such a lukewarm warm welcome in all my years of living in hotels.  2. Couple of fire alarms during my stay. Fair play to the hotel they waived my location charge. I did appreciate that so not all bad. First fire alarm went off at 2.30am. A shocker. 3. Their bar even for NYC standards is expensive. $30 for two gin and tonics. Add more for service etc and it’s quite a cost. 4. Noisy experience the whole time. Didn’t get a decent sleep in 5 nights. The view.. is just breathetaking!! 38th floor. Clean and neat room. Perfect place to stay.  stayed 4 nights and had a perfect experience. whenever come back to New York, will stay in Motto surely. hate to leave the room. Hi,  In general, I noticed many pros of your residence:  1. Great location. 2. Positive-energy and responsible staff on the desk and in the restaurant. 3. Size of the room was nice - there was enough space even though there was no wardrobe to keep your clothes/stuff.  However, during my stay, I also noticed some disadvantages:  1. The cleaning team damaged my clothes during the cleaning process - my $250 jumper was bleached by some chemical materials. It\\'s disappointing. 2. Two times we got too many towels in the room, while a few of them were laying on the floor. 3. We got two fire alarms during our stay (2am and in the morning the next day)  and it was a very uncomfortable experience. I understand that it\\'s not hotel\\'s fault though but one of the clients (i suppose someone As you approach the hotel, just outside the main doors, you can start to smell scent of the hotel, that just tells you all you need to know about how the place keeps up its appearance and everything. Amazing place to stay from start to finish and cannot recommend enough.   Reception staff were amazing, made me feel like I’d known them for years. Great Rapport. Bar staff were great, Room was perfect, we had a clear skyline view of the city with the new world trade centre in the distance.   Highly recommend this place as it’s very close to all connections & walkable distance to everything else.   All I can say is Thank You :)'},\n",

Might try the midtown location next time. Only one downside was not having a bathtub- after all the walking a soak would have been nice. I needed a well priced, downtown hotel near my friend’s apartment in Hudson Square and this was perfect. Close to multiple subway lines and the water which was a nice place to walk. It’s a very calm area in an otherwise wonderfully busy city. The room was perfect - the storage and space was so well thought out and there was a purpose for every single thing. I’ve stayed in similar hotels in London and Paris recently and the Arlo really did it the best. Will be staying here in the future, I am so glad to finally find a hotel that just gets it. Also the lobby smells incredible!! Helpful staff: Andrew, Michelle, Marcus, Al, and Amaris. Amazing hotel in a perfect location. The bed is super comfortable and the facilities are awesome. The staff are definitely the best part and are all so helpful and friendly. It made our stay as care free as possible. Shout out Alejandro. I was so seriously impressed with the Arlo in Soho. It was immaculately clean and in a safe and accessible area. The staff was AMAZING. Edwyn and Ivan were particularly helpful with bag storage. You can tell they love their jobs! We had an amazing trip to NYC and it was exponentially better because of our accommodations at the Arlo. 10/10, will stay again. Great service and attitude from all the staff.  Easy check-in / out.  Then the front deck went the extra Maile to retrieve my left behind iPad and courier it to JFK before my flight left.  Amazing!  The restaurant on site doesn\\'t have a huge menu but everything and especially the salads were wonderful and the service low key and perfect. The rosemary mescal margarita was totally original,  smokey, herbal and subtly sweet.  Our  urban view room was small, but well designed and perfectly maintained.  My only suggestion would be the addition of a handheld shower head to the rain fall head. Absolutely phenomenal stay!!  Loved everything about the hotel, but most importantly everyone who works there is amazing! Huge thanks to Alejandro for going above and beyond! It wouldn’t be the same stay with his help! Also, front desk was amazing and helped me with the best possible view!!  Huge thanks to Arlo! Loved it! Will come back! It is a very cozy place.  It\\'s a shame the space is very small, the rooms are very small, but the guys pay attention.  Dean.  Ivan and Alejandro excellent.  We feel at home, thank you.  see you soon.   It is a very cozy place.  It\\'s a shame the space is very small, the rooms are very small, but the guys pay attention.  Dean.  Ivan and Alejandro excellent.  We feel at home, thank you.  see you soon We had a wonderful stay in December 2023! The staff was phenomenally helpful and friendly, and the hotel was beautiful. Especially great around the winter holidays—so festive! All the staff were wonderful; Ivan and Lay especially went above and beyond in providing an exceptional experience. Thanks to everyone at Arlo Soho! Everyone at the hotel are very helpfully Alejandro is an excellent  employee. We visited the rooftop, the lounge and the speak easy bar, and we live it. Close to everything. The hotel is very clean and smells delicious. Excellent service. Thank you to Edwyn, Danny, Alejandro and the rest of the team! The bodega in the lobby is very convenient and everything we need is a few blocks away.  Easy walk to World Trade Center or up to Midtown. Good clean rooms and quiet, even with the holland tunnel right outside. We had a wonderful time. The hotel is gorgeous, very clean, the bed is very comfortable, and all the staff (especially Alejandro) were superb. We really enjoyed spending time at the speakeasy bar, and the bodega was great for early morning coffees. The Arlo Soho is in a great location with some fabulous bars and restaurants to explore. We love coming to New York and this has been our favourite hotel and district so far. We will be back!  Claire and Lee Staff were really friendly when we arrived and throughout the stay they were always around to help. Alejandro was especially helpful. The Rooms were really nice and cleaned daily. I was very happy with the chrome cast option on the TV. Overall a great stay! Amazing place to stay!!! Staff was super friendly and kind. Driving in an out was seamless! Bed was comfortable, room was clean! I would definitely Recommend  staying at Arlo Soho when visiting. Perfect location for walking/catching the subway Nicest staff I’ve ever met , they were very friendly and helping with all parts of our stay. Very clean room lobby and facilities. It was a great experience and the hotel is in a great location , it is walking distance from subway and many tourist attractions. highly recommend. All the staff were consistently friendly, welcoming and helpful. I noticed the rooms in the hotel were named like the rooms in a house and there was definitely a comfortable ,homey feeling throughout. The rooms were modern, spotless and the linens beautiful. The one thing I would value is having, is coffee available in the room. Al at the front desk checked me in. The process was quick and easy and he provided amazing hospitality. He gave me a tour of the hotel amenities and also gave me a list of restaurants to eat at in the area!  The staff here is amazing and the rooms are really nice and clean! The location was perfect. Hotel was super clean service was amazing.Danny Andrew and Amaya really went above and beyond I was celebrating my anniversary. We was able to get a complimentary upgrade complimentary wine and a handwritten note it was super cute. We had pizza at the Restaurant it was delicious they also had a stand up comedy going on it was so much fun. The hotel was full of life good vibes and great staff can’t wait to go back. Rooms where cozy perfect for our romantic getaway. Had a fantastic stay, went for a short stay with my son. Location is very convenient, super friendly staff. Edwin and Danny were always welcoming with a smile on their face. Checking in, I faced some issues which were promptly solved, which actually saved my trip. Will definitely stay here again if I am in town. One of the, if not? The most nicest and professional staff I have ever met. From the time I arrived, they were conscious of opening the door., greeting me upon arrival and departure each day, arranging car service, on and on.  If they saw you, they made eye contact and asked if they could assist with anything.  And although the entire staff were like this, Edwin and Danny were especially great and went above and beyond. Special shout out to them specifically.  Highly recommend this hotel. My daughter and I stayed at the Arlo SoHo hotel on Hudson Street last December.  Clean and friendly environment. The staff is amazing, especially Edwyn, Lay, Robert and Danny. Will definitely return on my next visit to New York and would recommend this hotel. Just got home from my vacation to NYC. I will always be going back to Arlo Soho, the guys there helped out so much and were great. Edwyn, Deinny, Al, and Ivan are the best! They made check in and check out a super easy process and answered any question I had. Thank you guys! We had a wonderful experience here after a spur decision for a 3 day date trip. The room as clean, aesthetic, and cozy. They offered plenty of amenities and the front desk staff were all amazing, but especially Edwyn, Danny, and Ivan! Really appreciated the pre-check in and post-checkout bag service. We stayed for a week over Christmas at the Arlo SoHo, first impressions were how wonderful it smelled. We had a few hiccups at the beginning but these were soon rectified by Damar who was the night manager that week. He was absolutely amazing with my rather large request. And every time I saw him in the morning he had a fantastic welcome for me. I am an early bird so I mainly saw the morning staff. Gary on reception always got me a hot water without me even asking and was super friendly and helpful. Servio’s service in Bodega was 2nd to none. He knew my order without me asking. A big shout out to Ashley also for all his help. The team are fantastic. Rooms comfortable and clean. I want to thank you all for making our stay memorable. We will be back for sure Selina X \"Exceptional stay at this hotel! Impeccable  accommodations, and a prime location. The staff went above and beyond to make our experience unforgettable. 5-star amenities and a delightful atmosphere. Can\\'t wait to return for another perfect getaway! Highly recommended. 👌🏨 #LuxuryTravel #TopNotchService\" special Thank you to Alejandro and night staff at reception for their extra attention to making sure we had the best stay 🙏❤️❤️❤️ Alejandro was great!! He helped us with our bags anytime we needed and always greeted us when we walked by. He made himself very accesible and helpful for us and definitely made our experience a 10/10. our third stay at the Arlo in the last 2+ years.  Important to note that the hotel is maintained, continues comfortable.  It happened that this was our first meal at the hotel restaurant, Lindens, and it was quite good.  Killer fries, well-presented and cooked mains.  We were very happy with that experience.    Visitors need to know that this is a boutique hotel that appeals to younger visitors.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  Rooms are quiet.  Lighting and outlets are good.    We love the location, on the border of the west village and tribeca.  Hotel is close to two subway stops on Canal St.  Lots of good restaurants close by.  If someone were driving and needed to arrive by car, the hotel is across from the Holland Tunnel entrance, so one can easily get there and have Staff was friendly and welcoming. The location in the city is nice and accessible, the hotel was clean and in good condition. The room was nice. Ashley was super helpful and helped with what I needed.  The staff was very helpful and accommodating  Danny checked us in and out and made the process quick  and enjoyable! He even helped us with an upgrade! Upon checkout Edwyn helped with our luggage and offered to call us a ride to the airport. We couldn’t be happier with this experience!  The room was clean every time I came back from outside. The staff downstairs was extremely helpful. I had an event in the city  my last day of my stay, and Edwyn and Danny made sure my bags were accounted for. Good hotel! The location is wonderful, right by Soho and the train. However, the best part of this hotel is the staff; their customer service is superb. I especially liked being greeted and helped every day by Alejandro at the lobby.  It was great experience! Al was so amazing he helped me feel welcome! Definitely will be going back. The city view room with king size bed was wonderful. The room has all that you need even with the size. Amazing Hotel and very accommodating!   We had an issue with our TV because we couldn’t use the Chromecast feature and Jarrid was amazing and sorted out our TV Chromecast issue for us very quickly and he came straight away.  Would highly recommend ! Jarrid was so helpful! We had a problem with our TV and he was straight up to help us. He was a lovely person and was quick to fix it for us. Would definyoy recommend staying here, the staff are so attentive Arlo SoHo is so far my favorite one, from the all three in Manhattan. Midtown has a great interior design too and well located for travelers. In my opinion, the best service, neighborhood to be in, and also the rooftop bar and downstairs bar in Arlo SoHo are the best. The amenities are very restfully designed and there is possible to work. The attention from Amayah was spectacular. Edwin and Danny were very friendly, diligent and professionals. Arlo SoHo is going to be one of my top choices on my business trips to New York every month.  Ashley did a wonderful job at accommodating to our needs. She was very helpful very friendly. It felt like I was talking to my best friend. The ARLO always feels like home to me every time I visit New York. 10/10 experience.  HAPPY BEW YEAR…….. The staff were very  helpful and friendly. Alejandro was the great help with our requests. Nice place very well organize. The hotel location is perfect to walking distance to everything.  I can not wait to go back again.     Everything was really nice! The only issue we had was that our room smelled a bit off, like an old wet smell. But it didn’t really matter after a while. The customer service was great! Alejandro was very kind and helpful as well. We will definitely be coming back!  Arlo SoHo Hotel achieves excellence, thanks to standout staff members Ivan, Danny, and Alejandro. Ivan\\'s seamless check-ins set a positive tone, while Danny\\'s dedication and recommendations enhance the guest experience. Alejandro\\'s exceptional service, from personalized assistance to genuine hospitality, adds a memorable touch. Together, they exemplify the hotel\\'s commitment to outstanding service, making Arlo SoHo a top choice for guests seeking a superb stay in New York City. It’s our first time to NewYork and I’m glad we stayed at Arlo soho for our stay. Ivan, Danny and Alejandro were super friendly, helpful and caring. They offered to help us with the luggages and were always there when we needed assistance. They explained the features of the hotel clearly and always greeted us with kind words. Really made us feel like home and we would like to stay here again when we come to New York again!   I don\\'t usually write reviews but Edwyn is definitely worth one . I\\'ve never stayed at a hotel where a staff member had an answer to every question I asked . As soon as I checked in edwyn was there to help me bring up my luggage to my room , then he recommended 3 great restaurants ,  and he also helped me organize transportation to the airport . He\\'s truly amazing !'},\n",

For me personally, Bryant Park Hotel is the best hotel in the world (from my travels in the US, Europe, Australia, and Asia). The words I associate with the BPH are: classy, warm, homey, sophisticated, comfortable, friendly, cheery, happy, bright, well located, accommodating. My spirits lift every time I walk in the front entrance. I\\'ve stayed here solo and with my family several times since 2012. I stayed for an extended period in Dec 2022 and didn\\'t get around to writing my review before I returned for a short visit solo in March 2023. In December, it was magical looking out onto the winter wonderland in Bryant Park and was lovely being toasty and warm in my bright and cheery suite when it was icy and miserable out. My trip ended abruptly in December and I had to rush back on We loved our stay at Bryant Park Hotel - the front desk team who helped us was amazing the entire time and Jo was incredible. She was so kind and helped us with our double booked stay. The hotel is beautiful, and the rooms are so spacious and bright, which is was a huge plus for New York. Everything was very clean. We only gave it 1 star less than 5 because the bed was not super comfortable. If you like firm beds, you will be at home here! Overall we would definitely stay again! The Bryant Park Hotel is our “go to” hotel when vacationing in New York. The warm staff, perfect location and the large tasteful rooms make staying at this iconic hotel a special experience.  We are also most appreciative of the kind personal hospitality extended to us by the gracious Guest Service Agent, Jo Kinsella. She’s great! This hotel is just terrific. I can’t wait to return. The location is fabulous and the staff there are very friendly, accommodating and helpful. I loved the spacious and well appointed room and bath Really top notch. This is definitely not worty as nr 1 ranked hotel in NY. Its a very good location though. Pretty large room & bathroom. Free coffee & muffins in the morning. Minibar with good selection. Servicefriendly staff. But the hotel is not very good maintained. Its screaming for renovation. Rooms, elevators, gym & public spaces. Cold floor on bathroom & very low pressure on the water. Takes minutes to wait for warm water. 1100 dollars for 3 nights are decent in NY, but i would find another hotel next time. Weak 4 Joe at the front desk was fantastic. Very accommodating with a great memory for personal preferences. The rooms are great, as are the bar and restaurant. The location is phenomenal. We have stayed before, and we will again. This is a beautiful hotel located just off 5th avenue and in the heart of midtown New York. On arrival we are treated very well by Jo Kinsella on the desk who made us feel very welcome and helped resolve  any small issues we had. The hotel bar is very nicely set up and the restaurant had good quality food Check-in was quick and efficient.  Room is small, sparse and feels like a college dormitory room.  There are few amenities.  For example, there is no coffee maker or hot water pot.  The room can be noisy when trying to sleep as nearby there were loud parties playing music.  The bathroom size was adequate but was freezing as the heat did not work.  In the morning, opposite the elevators is coffee and tea as well as mass produced muffins that were practically half baked.  Would I stay here again?  Probably not.  Would I recommend it to others?  Probably not. My stay at the BRYANT PARK Hotel was exceptional. It started with a super warm greeting by Jo Kinsella, who was so incredibly welcoming, she made me feel like I was at home. Jo was professional, kind and displayed a level of customer service that was above and beyond the norm. My room was spotless, cozy and quiet. Located right in the heart of BRYANT PARK, it was easy access to my meetings, restaurants and Grand Central. I highly recommend this hotel. My husband and I just returned from a two night stay at the Bryant Park.  Everything was fantastic from the upgraded room, to Josephine at the front desk, to the young man who always helps us with our bags (sorry I do not know his name).  The hotel is perfectly located so we could walk to museums and Broadway.  It was so much fun to watch the ice skaters from our windows on the 22nd floor!  The service is so consistently good that this has become the only place we stay when we come to N.Y. The Bryant Park Hotel gave us superb customer service, from our early phone calls expressing interest in the accommodations, to a tour of the rooms, and friendly recommendations to local favorites. We especially appreciate Scott at the front desk and Dom in the lobby for the attention to detail and warm welcome. We look forward to our next stay in the Big Apple at the Bryant Park Hotel.  The Bryant Park Hotel was magic. I have never stayed at such a property with such an amazing staff and I have stayed in a lot of places in New York. John and Z were amazing, welcoming, attentive and had great senses of humor. Pluses (besides staff), the room overlooked Bryant Park, the carousel, the skating rink and the NY Public Library. I could have spent my entire trip looking out my window. Small things -- huge, warm bathrobes. a spare blanket, perfect pillows, heat that you could control (I like it cold at night thus the need for the spare blanket and warm in the day), fantastic room amenities. a huge bathtub and separate shower. Other things that I though were gone forever were  beds that are actually made crisply and pens in the room (I confess, I took them home.) No Had the most wonderful stay at The Bryant Park Hotel. We were warmly welcomed by Jo at the front desk upon checkin and every staff member was so helpful and accommodating. Our room was spacious (especially for NYC!) and beautifully furnished with the most spectacular view of Bryant Park. My husband and I loved having a glass of wine while looking out over the ice skating rink. The bed was very comfortable and we really appreciated the little touches such as a sound machine in our room and the luxurious Molten Brown Toiletries. The location was so perfect for everything we needed to do. Just a quick walk to the Museum of Modern Art, Central Park and plenty of shopping and restaurants. You’re even incredibly close to Time Square/Rockefeller Center (less than a 5 min walk) but just The hotel is located right at the heart of 6th Ave at 40 St which s perfect for all major attractions. The staff were friendly and the room was spacious and clean. A special mention to Jo on reception who took time to discuss our plans and made us feel very welcome  We had stayed at another hotel on Bryant Park before, I think it was the Bryant Park Terrace. Mistakenly I thought the Bryant Park Hotel was the same place but it’s a few meters away, conveniently and charmingly located right across from Bryant Park with its Christmas decorations, winter village and ice skating rink of which we had a glorious view from our room. Unfortunately some ugly scaffolding adorned the Bryant Park just now, spoiling the entry way. But the staff welcome was good and friendly and prompt when we arrived. I didn’t know the Bryant Park was #1 in New York on TripAdvisor (I knew it was highly ranked) but I can see how it got its rating. Slightly dated the elevators need some updating but they worked ok and our room was a very generously appointed suite with two While the décor isn\\'t my taste, the room was very large by NYC standards (at least 100 sq feet larger than my past few rooms) and the bathroom is massive and beautiful. We sprung for a park view room and I am so glad we did. The view absolutely made our stay. The weather wasn\\'t great so being able to sit in the room and watch all of the holiday festivities over at Bryant Park without getting wet or being in in the massive crowd was so wonderful. I kept telling myself not to check my phone but just enjoy the view for the few days we were there. I wish we could have stayed longer. The restaurant and bar were closed on Christmas day so we didn\\'t get to try those. Staff most days were amazing and kind. We also loved the Hershey\\'s kisses at reception. Also, there\\'s a privacy button The BPH is the best hotel in NYC. The rooms are clean and very spacious. The location is perfect regardless the time of year you are visiting however what makes this hotel stand out above all is the staff. They are nicest, caring, helpful people you will ever meet. We just returned from spending 2 beautiful nights at the BPH, upon check in my  boyfriend mentioned that he was proposing to me on this trip. We were upgraded to the amazing  Raymond Hood suite with champagne. A special shout out to Jo and Julio who went above and beyond to make our trip magical. We are truly blessed!! Thank you :)  I highly recommend this hotel, you will not regret it.  Until next time!!! The location was amazing! Unfortunately,  it rained but being able to walk across the street to Bryant park was convenient.  Jo Kinsella at the front desk was a wonderful breath of fresh air in the city.  She was professional and had a kind spirit that made you feel like you were visiting a family member.  Ronin her counter part was equally accommodating.  Those two alone would make me go back. Been coming to BPH for about a decade when I need to get away if even just for a night. Service was great, loved the deep soaking tub as always, and the bartender at Célon was lovely. My upgraded room was really spacious and I had a great late checkout and departure thanks to Josephine at the front desk. She was so great to chat with! I felt rested and happy upon leaving. Looking forward to my next stay already.  Probably the friendliest staff I have ever experienced at a hotel. Upon checkout, Josephine was amazing. So friendly and inquired about our trip and who I was with. It just makes a huge difference to be treated this way. Great location and close to everything you need. Thank you to the whole staff for a great stay. Celebrating a milestone wedding anniversary, we chose the Bryant Park Hotel for its ideal location, great service reputation, and the terrific reviews on TripAdvisor.  It did not disappoint.  We booked the junior suite for the extra space, the views of Bryant Park, and the handsomely outfitted bathroom that included a deep soaking bathtub.  Large bathrooms with tubs are a rarity in almost any hotel, and practically non-existent in New York.  Thanks to all the front desk staff who provided exceptional service on our stay...with a special shout-out to Josephine and John.  I wish I could mention everyone by name, as your attention and kindness was displayed consistently by everyone.  And lastly... thank you for not counting the number of front desk Hershey kisses I snarfed up We had never stayed at The Bryant Park Hotel before and chose to because it had great reviews and was within walking distance from Grand Central Terminal - what a great hotel.  Shannon checked us in and she was so welcoming and accommodating to our needs (having just carried our bags from GCT) and took the time to further explain hotel services while walking us to our elevator.  Our room was a modern well-appointed corner unit with views of Bryant Park and the bathroom was luxurious and incredibly spacious.  The location of this hotel is truly incredible.  We had left dinner reservations to the last minute so I asked Veronica at the check-in desk for some advice. She kindly offered to check with the restaurant adjacent to the hotel (Koi) to see if a table was available and Great hotel and a great stay. Shannon at the front desk was so helpful. Our room had an amazing view of Bryant Park and the Christmas market and skating rink. Great location!  Had a good dinner right next door. Busy area during December but FUN!  Easy to get anywhere from here! My new Fiancé and I stayed an evening at the hotel that was nothing short of extraordinary! Upon first entering the premises we were greeted with welcoming smiles, champagne and a big Congrats! The service from all staff was remarkable, they made sure we were happy, comfortable and well taken care of! I have to give a special shout out and Thank You to Chris Monico  as well as Kieran who both truly went above and beyond to decorate our room adding many extra details that were so heartfelt! I felt like such a star for the evening and there aren’t enough words to express my gratitude and appreciation!  The Bryant Park hotel felt like my home away from home and I am looking forward to many more stays there! The staff was superb during our stay and particularly wanted to thank Larry Houseman who helped us our last evening with a food devliery. He was so pleasant and a true gem! We thank you all for a great stay and thank you Larry!!  We were just in NYC and stayed at this hotel.  You could not be more centrally located for The Christmas Markets and Skating Rink, The NY Public Library etc.  Right in the heart of the city.  The staff were incredible and made our stay just so relaxing.  In particular, a big shout out to Shannon at \"Reception\".  She treated us like royalty and I\\'m sure that every guest walks away feeling the same.  Thank you! So just to start by saying, one of the best experiences I ever had in my life . From accommodations to comfort to all in all service. My vision for a wonderful night out with my new Fiance was put together beyond expected by the team at Bryant park hotel .. Christopher Monico went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. The views of the Bryant park skate rink and lights gave us warm feeling like it was my own home . The bed super confortable, warm and gorgeous room , mini bar stocked with everything you  need to have a cozy night in, when I say attention to detail Bryant park hotel definitely knows how to do it . Upon entrance my bag was taken for me and carried to the room for me .service 100000 percent top notch .. definitely recommend everyone stay there number 1 The Bryant Park Hotel is excellent, its location is perfect, adjacent to Bryant Park, excellent location, between 5th and 6th avenues, in the center of the city and the entertainment center, very close to subway stations - a 2-minute walk (at the end of the block), excellent hotel service, willingness to help with any question / need that rises Special thanks to: Ray, Shanan, Zaul and John. The staff was amazing. They did everything they could to make our stay memorable.  The rooms were spotless.  Special shout out to Veronica, the front end manager, Jo and Scott. They should be on a talent show, after listening to them sing Happy Birthday to my fiancee. If you plan to visit NYC,  and need a place to stay, you will not go wrong with the Bryant Park Hotel. \"The Trio\" that is, two ladies and a gentleman in their eighties, approached New York with some trepidation albeit \"on the bucket list\"!!!! Pleased to say that Siobhan the   manager, Jo and the front desk, plus the concierge team at Bryant Park Hotel , ensured that we need not have had any concerns as they were so friendly, helpful and made us feel \"one of the family\". The reservations for Thanksgiving Day, theatre, and restaurants were superb and helped to make our stay in New York unforgettable. The hotel is in fantastic situation for a tourists holiday - central for everything.   What an amazing trip we had. This trip was my partners dream Christmas location and it turned out to be her very own fairytale of New York.   The hotel is absolutely amazing, whether it be the staff, location or even a nice hot bath after a long day walking round the cold city - Bryant park hotel had it all. The suite with a Bryant park view was especially nice!!   I want to say a huge special thank you to Kieran Bennett who helped bring my dreams to life! I had been speaking to Kieran for a few weeks prior to flying out as I’d planned to propose to my partner. I’d given him an idea of what I wanted but couldn’t be more grateful for how he brought it to life!! She said yes & I just wish I could have thanked him in person!   You’ll not regret staying here!  This hotel is in the perfect location during Christmas time especially because it\\'s right across from Bryant park and the Christmas market. Josephine at the front desk is a sweetheart, personable and helpful offering recommendations to eateries nearby. The room and hotel itself could use some updating and repairs. All the hotel staff was very accommodating and welcoming. The celon on site had a cool ambiance for some drinks.  Great experience from arrival to departure. A most accommodating staff - friendly, helpful and well informed.  We loved our suite, roomy, bright, very well maintained and the view was outstanding - facing Bryant Park. Bryant Park Hotel is in the best location for a holiday visit.  You can walk to everything including having the Winter Village right across the street!  The front desk staff made our birthday extra special with hand signed cards, balloon and a bottle of Prosecco.  Big shout out to Josephine for being so nice and welcoming! I\\'ve stayed at the Bryant Park Hotel close to ten times on different occasions so I know about this hotel way more than most guests who\\'ve reviewed here. I also stayed at many different hotels in NYC in the past, including multiple big name \"five-star\" hotels. If you are one of the lucky people reading this review, please do yourself a favor and just stay at the Bryant Park Hotel whenever you visit the City next time. This is absolutely the best hotel you are going to find in the City. The quality of service provided by the hotel staff members is unparalleled. Kieran always makes sure if I need anything before my arrival. At the reception desk, Shannen (who set the whole tone of this hotel for me when I first visited the hotel drenched in rain) always greets me and checks me in My husband Jim and I stayed at the Bryant Park Hotel a few days before and up to Thanksgiving Day.  It was wonderful!!  The hotel was within walking distance to shopping, the theatre, museums, Madison Square Gardens, subway, etc.  The view of Bryant Park was beautiful with the ice skating and vendors.  Many places to dine.  But most importantly we were able to do all of these things with ease because of the wonderful staff at the hotel, especially Jo Kinsella at the front desk.  She, along with others whose name I did not catch, were wonderful. She provided directions, places to eat, places to go, arranged transportation if needed, anything we needed help with was taken care of.  And believe me, we asked PLENTY of questions! Everyone was always very courteous and greeted us with Minimalist decor but warm and fuzzy staff, especially Ronan and Dwight upon arrival.  Location central to subways, 5th Avenue and choice restaurants.  Former Radiator building provided panache and basement cocktails. After a very long day of travel we were pretty needy guests night one.  We called guest services several times for additional comfort items (too many times) Larry Houseman arrived so quickly and with such a positive attitude, really made us feel valued and so welcome.  Management, this man deserves a raise and promotion ASAP  Fantastic hotel and in the best location on Bryant Park, all the staff were incredibly friendly with a special mention to Jo at the front desk who looked after us with some great advice. Rooms were larger than normal for New York and the downstairs bar had a great vibe to it. We will definitely return to The Bryant Park Hotel.'},\n",

The whole process from first My room was very clean. I went on a trip with my father and was able to get a bunk bed room. I was able to see Some of the billboards from Times Square from my room. The staff was lovely! They answered any questions I had and were very expedient. If you don\\'t mind small spaces, it\\'s honestly perfect. The location is fantastic: right beside multiple restaurants, a corner store, and within walking distance to iconic spots like Rockefeller Center and popular shopping spots (Nintendo store, Hershey store, Disney store). Check-in and check-out were a breeze, room was clean. My friend and I had a bunk bed room. We enjoyed the fact that we each had our own television. The top bunk was a little difficult to get up onto mostly because of the ladder being made of metal... it was a bit painful on the feet, and nothing to grip onto to pull yourself onto the bed... would probably not be an issue for a child or younger person (I\\'m mid-30s). The first night we found it to be extremely noisy--to be expected since the hotel is in a high For being a \"3 star hotel\" it really should be more. Over all the only things I would change would be, a bigger sign out front or at the very least a second one higher up. Additionally I wish there was a little more information on how to get to the lobby for first time visitors. Wonderful hotel with interesting rooms, friendly staff, and a location that it great to explore Time Square and the surrounding areas. Would definitely return again and again.  I visit New York for business at least once a year for the last 15 years or so. We booked 10 rooms here for a team of people from my company this year. This is my first time staying at this hotel, and I’ve got to say the service has been terrific, especially from “Sahar” at check-in!  The rooms are somewhat small (normal for NYC), but they are super-clean. It can be hard to find a quiet room in New York, but the SW facing rooms are actually very quiet. (NE was significantly louder.) This is a great location for walking to either the Javits Convention Center or Times Square. I will definitely be back. I love this hotel! The location was perfect for the price and I felt very safe here. It was perfect for my little get away with my boyfriend. we had such an amazing view as well.  they also held our bags after check out which was so appreciated.   Bedding extremely hard along with rough pillows my whole body has been sore since staying at this hotel. The sheets would not stay on. The blanket which you use to cover yourself was so thin you had to keep the heat up high in the room. My absolute favorite hotel to stay at in the city. It’s cheaper than any other place, and so so clean. There’s just enough space for me & my things. The staff is also so accommodating. Sahar specifically helped me stay in the same room when my reservation was split so I didn’t have to pack up all over again. I can’t recommend Pod enough! I found the hotel to be excellent. I needed something affordable as close to Midtown as possible. The location is very convenient. I especially appreciated the complimentary walking tours they offer. If your travel plans involve the Theater District, Lincoln Center, and Times Square, you would be wise to save a little money and stay at this hotel. In my opinion its a small room for two people but everything else was perfect. We ran out of toilet paper and body wash but as soon as we asked the staff they provided everything we needed. The location is awesome, and overall I`m never dissapointed by this hotel. I would stay there again. Perfectly located, fair price, no hidden costs, kind staff, new and clean rooms, bathroom with shower as i like them, quiet room even if we\\'re in a noisy area, We feel secure in the hotel. Good restaurants in the vicinity.  Close to Times Square, the High line, etc.  I only had one night here but it was perfect for what I needed. The room was clean, comfortable and had everything I needed. The staff were helpful and there was a restaurant where I could pick up breakfast which made it super convenient for a quick stay. I would fully recommend it and would come back again. location is awesome, it is right next to the port authority and super close to Time square! If you have any question about traveling around New York City, you can ask people in the hotel they are super friendly and willing to provide some tips for planning out NYC trip.  Like I said, it was a pleasure to stay at a great location. Great staff nice bar. Everybody was very helpful and knowledgeable. They were able to answer almost all of our questions since this was our first time to New York City again very very helpful. Rooms were clean. nothing to complain about would stay there again. Also would recommend to anyone.  Obviously popular with travelers from all over the world because of its location, the lobby and elevators seem constantly crowded which as always frustrating. Daily room service never happened, even when requested. The room was comfortable for such a small space. The mattress and pillows were very comfortable and I got a good night\\'s sleep! The location was convenient. It was fairly quiet in the room, considering what a busy part of the city we were in. Staff was friendly and helpful! Excellent hotel in fab location just moments away from Ties Square , compact room was clean and modern and every mod con that you could need including excellent wifi and loan of a kettl.  Great customer service. Bed and bed sheets are bad. room noise is bad. The overall experience with employees and cleaning was good. price not sure justifies, you can get a bigger room and better bed at hotels close by. location is good.  Stayed here one night when going to see the Rockettes  It was clean, modern, basic. I would stay here again, I would give it 4 stars but it has that stupid resort fee added, so I knocked one star off for that. Given the service and the basic accommodations I can\\'t imagine what that\\'s even for, other than adding $25 to the price and reducing the impact of variability in rates to them  You\\'re in a tiny room with a bunk bed. All I could think when lying there was, this is what a couple of hundred a night gets you? But that\\'s not really their fault. NYC prices are insane.  Anyway, it was OK, but it really is a sardine can. Don\\'t expect any frills.  Great hotel in the middle of it all.  The staff was super friendly and efficient.  The restaurant staff was also super friendly and professional.  It was my 2nd time in the city and my ladies 1st visit.  Thanks for making it such a great experience.  Special shout out to Shawn Mason, their front office director.  We had an incident that was beyond his control happen.  Shawn went above and beyond to make it right.  Strong finish to a great time in NYC!!  We will definitely recommend them to fam and friends!! Our initial experience with Shanna was extremely disappointing. She had the worst attitude and was extremely rude and disrespectful. Again after speaking with the director we may give it another shot in 2024 hopefully without any hick-ups. Thank you for having us Having stayed many times at the two PODS on the East Side, this location was quite a departure.  First, 22 stories and a quite modern building (retrofitted from what, I wonder).  Second, bring earplugs, even on the 21st floor.  42nd Street at 7th seemed like a continual EMT/Firetruck/Bus/Garbage Truck meet-up.  Yea, I know, Times Square.  But, it has all the great qualities of the other PODS, friendly, capable staff, real value, and most everything works. Was upgraded minutes after making my booking! The rooms are good I was pleasantly surprised! There was a very warm welcome and they made me feel at home! The exceptional one was Sahar she was amazing and was more than accommodating she’s something special! She’s too Leng as well! Loved this place and will return! Absolutely great hotel if you want a base to explore NYC. I stayed with my partner, and although the room was small, it was very clean and had all the amenities we needed (we weren’t in there very much anyway as we were out exploring). Staff seemed lovely, and the building itself was very secure and clean. Great  size room .very  clean  .I loved the fact that the Westside theater was around  the corner . Food options were all over the place. parking garage one block away  .check in and check out service  was quick and pain less This hotel was very nice to stay at, the scenery overlooking the city was very nice, staff was very friendly and helpful. Very close to places like diners, shops, restaurants and best of all Times Square!  Nowhere to get water! Had to ask multiple staff, bartender finally found some. No vending machines. Coffee/breakfast bar not very user friendly, almond milk in the creamer carafe, pastries and juice low quality. Sheet and thin blanket on bed, no other bedding available. Overall lack of amenities and service made me wish I\\'d spent a little more to stay at a regular hotel. On the plus side, the decor in the room was nice, view nice, shower very nice. We had a twin bunk room. The room was small but we were only there to sleep. The shower was nice with built in shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Each bunk had a charging station and tv which was nice. High ceilings and big windows helped to make it feel bigger The location is perfect as starting point to go everywhere, but a little noisy even when the window is closed. The bathroom and shower are gorgeous but the room is not properly clean, and you find only a small piece of soap on the basin to wash hands. The person who did the cleaning decided that my plastic bag with zip and underwear in it was worth to throw away. At the reception they pretended they were trying to help but didn’t care. They promised a small refund as I asked, and after a while they said that I had to blame booking…I had to buy new underwear and I expected the refund for it since a serious hotel would provide for it  Lack of room service throughout my stay. Despite being a guest for five nights, room service was only asked on the day of checkout. Vetting and communicating with external car booking service providers need to be improved.   Within blocks of the main part of Times Square and the Metro Station. And very central to the main sights. The room was clean, and really well said out. The beds were comfortable. The staff was very welcoming and helpful Perfect location.  Friendly staff. Functional  clean room. Great value for money. Stayed in room 831 nice view. Bunk bed rooms have alot more space. Use your room key to operate  the elevator to the  desired  floor. Public bathrooms  in bar if you need them. The Pod was a good hotel for the price. You are in a great location near to Times Square, so many restaurants to try, and subway stations conveniently near. The hotel provides bare minimum amenities, but if you are planning to sight see and won’t be in the room much, it wasn’t a problem. Staff were very friendly and were eager to provide more towels and toilet paper upon request. Our only issue with the room was our sink did not drain properly and would pool up to nearly full and it was never fixed despite saying something. Overall though, the hotel was great for the price, clean, nice location, and had a great view to the city.  I\\'ve stayed at Pod42 many, many times: ideally located, very comfortable and well-designed rooms, and friendly and accommodating staff. 9th Ave at 42nd St is very close to all subways and the scores of diverse restaurants nearby on 9th Ave are amazing.  My friend and I needed last minute accommodations and the Pod Times Square had the price point in our range. It\\'s tiny but clean and the location was pretty central to everything. I slept well. It\\'s small but had exactly what I needed would def stay there again!  Location wise, it\\'s pretty good, until you get a room that faces flashing lights all night and the windows only block 75% of the light. The rooms were clean enough considering the size. It was simple, spartan, and it would have been perfectly fine for us if it weren\\'t for the fact the beds are somewhat uncomfortable, putting in requests for no housekeeping and still experiencing attempts for housekeeping (no, there was no door sign to put up), and for a confirmed late checkout to be ignored.. Spend the extra 50-100 to go somewhere else because Times Square is a zoo anyway, you might as well be comfortable.  Proximity to Hell\\'s Kitchen was nice, though, so at least all the food choices nearby were phenomenal.  This was the worst hotel I have ever been to.  The rooms are so overpriced for the absolute tiny size that they are.  The staff never said good morning or evening every time we returned.  We were welcomed one night by a vagrant outside peeing on the wall.  Then another night right by the elevator another vagrant was begging money from us.  I was with my 11 year old daughter and she was so scared. You literally couldn\\'t swing a cat in the room, the shower was luke warm at best and no maid service even though its a pricey hotel.  . When we were leaving we asked the front desk to order us a taxi and were told they would only order a taxi if we were going to the airport, which we weren\\'t, we were going to another hotel.  We had to wait 2 hours outside with our suitcases and still no We stayed at the POD TIMES SQUARE recently for an overnighter. BEST decision ever! Staff was SO helpful AND friendly. Close to great restaurants and the theatres. Room was comfy & clean... AND so much cheaper than some of the other places around! A++++ Highly recommend. We loved our stay. Hotel is located at one of the best places Just 1 or 2  blocks from Times Square. Even for the dates we travel in December the price was great, the room is small but comfy and just what you need to sleep, rest and take a shower. The staff was really nice to us, and they gave us an early check in as we arrived at 8am, and took care of our luggage on check out day so we can enjoy the rest of the day before our flight. Recommend 10/10 The beds were horribly hard on our backs and the pillows were rice paper thin. Never slept well. The shower is very slippery, falls definitely a possibility. Only, I mean only positive was the location. Never again. '},\n",

Amazing!!!!!!    I will definitely stay at this hotel again!!!!!    Difficult in NYC Times Square to find a place to stay.   Try this hotel! We had read the reviews and were a little concerned regarding customer service issues. We had EXCEPTIONAL service throughout our entire stay. The gentleman at the elevators, the front desk staff, housekeeping, and the bar staff- shout out to Justin and Jenn- were all extremely helpful, quick with a smile, and just kind.    The rooms are a bit small but they make the most of the limited space and they were very clean.   The bar is a bit expensive but that was to be expected.  The drinks were well made and the wings and breakfast foods were delicious.   No complaints at all. I stayed here for one night.  The front desk staff were absolutely great. I was upgraded to a room with a great view of Times Square which was awesome. The rooms are small but very modern and new feeling. The hotel is in a good spot for walking in the city. Really enjoyable. Shenille was very pleasant at the cafe!!!! She definitely has a heart  of gold!!!!!! Please check her out if you ever visit!!!!!!!!!!!! Dino the Valet Guy was out of this world, made my transition smooth and stress Free!!!! Those 2 people were The BEST The hotel is best located but really rooms are small and really unrealistically priced   Service I suppose you forget when u chk in  The staff in restaurant is nice met Henry a waiter too sweet and good to be working in this sad Hiltons misadventure Great hotel, fantastic stay. Hotel rooms were clean, lounge area was great and quiet. But the best, was my experience with the Bluestone Lane cafe, privately owned within this hotel. The exceptional level of hospitality here was above and beyond. I ordered an Americano, but it wasnt originally made the way Im accustomed too in Bluestone Lane. I went to the counter to get a new Americano if possible the way I wanted it, and Henry went way above and beyond to accomdate me. The entire staff was warm,bubbly and friendly, even my business partner was exceptionally pleased.  Henry was a joy of fresh air, and remade me a great americano. Very professional and uplifting comments from this individual. This man deserves a raise! Harun, Bibi, Kaizia, Sagan and the team lead Chelsea, all This Hotel was absolutely amazing the room was luxurious, neat and beautiful my partner and I loved the amenities the room came with.  Kessi at the front desk was an absolute pleasure she was generous and very helpful! I would definitely recommend 10/10 Fast and friendly checkin. Was offered an upgraded room, room 2302, which is the best hotel room in the building. This room is a full Times Square view and very clean.  An amazing view and room. The whole staff was friendly from the doormen to everyone else.  If there was something I could change it would be the additional charge of $34/day, which I have personally titled “activity fee”. At least $10/day of that can go towards a purchase in the restaurant within the hotel.  But you have to make sure the $10 gets deducted from your bill. This is one thing I would say to be watchful of.  I travel a lot and I use Hilton quite a bit, plus I’ve provided feedback on TripAdvisor as much as possible over the last 20+ years. And besides the additional fee I would put this hotel within I give one star to the Tempo Hilton Hotel. I tried to open my room at around 6:50 on 01/05/24 in the morning with the digital key, but it was not working for the gym. When I tried to get my physical card from the room, it also didn’t work and prompted me to call.  I called five times with no answer, so I went down to reception. There, I encountered the rudest receptionist I’ve ever met. He said that security had to go up with me to check my ID, even though my digital key and ID were not accepted as proof.  While I understand and appreciate good safety measures, I complained about the digital key not working and the inconvenience caused. Instead of acknowledging my frustration, the receptionist told me not to raise my voice and accused me of being disrespectful. He claimed that I 1) We booked and paid on 15th November (1.5 months in advance) the corner room with the New year Ball view. the price for this view for 1 night is more than 2000 USD. We travel with my family (my wife and 3 children). 2) when we arrived on 31/12/2023 the staff gave us keys with no any comments about any problems. 3) In the room we realized that this is not a room we paid (no view to Time square and the Ball). 4) We returned to the desk and the receptionist told us that there are no available rooms with the Ball view . Overbooking... one more time - I paid 2000+ USD for the room 1.5 months ago. I asked : why I didn't say anything during check it? no answers. But after I clearly understand why... We (including 3 children) had only 3.5 hours before the New Year and they thought Check in was 3 pm. We arrived at the hotel at 3:10pm. We went to check in at the front desk where they checked me in, paid for the room plus a few fees I didn’t know I would be paying all for them to tell me the room isn’t ready and they’ll let me know when it’s ready (should be 10-15 minutes). 3:45 rolls around and the lobby is packed full of people waiting around for their rooms to be ready. Some were waiting for over an hour for their rooms to be ready. The front desk personnel were rude to anyone who asked for an update on when the room would be ready. The reason that bothers me is if I’m an hour late to check out, I get charged another night but the hotel can withhold your room from you for over an hour and you still pay full price. My wife was feeling poorly as she is Excellent hotel, beautiful facilities, very comfortable, and very centrally located. We loved it! We were on vacation with my family and had a mishap when we checked out, leaving our passports forgotten in the room safe. We only realized the next day and contacted the hotel. Luckily, we encountered Tee (security team) , who helped us recover them. Many thanks to Tee for her kind assistance. This speaks highly of the hotel's commitment to taking care of its guests' belongings. Had an absolute BLAST!  Hotel is located prime time in middle of Times Square!  Rooms are slightly small but accommodating, modern & with a huge bathroom! Staff was friendly & helpful while bar was convenient with a cool environment. We’ll be back! 2 days before we were due to fly to New York I  noticed a pending charge on my card for £528.74, puzzled,  thought  my option is to pay in full on arrival.    After our plane was delayed for 4 hours from Dublin we arrived at Tempo NY Hilton Times Square at 11pm on 23rd Dec shattered, stressed, tired and disappointed we missed out  on the daytime sight seeing because we should have arrived in the afternoon.   The hotel lobby has a beautiful entrance which gave us a big lift from our damped  spirits.    I enquired at the check in desk about the pending charge on my card - Tempo NY Hilton Times were holding £528.74  since 21st Dec which had limited my spending power I was told it will be refunded back to my account once  we checked out.   So I Paid the room in full however I kept Great hotel. Comfy beds. Great bar. Was disappointed to find they did not have on site parking, but I went to find the valet service was above and beyond. Find Deano. I don’t know if he’s the manager for the valet service, but he should be manager of the whole hotel. He grabbed our luggage from the truck, put it on a cart, and walked us up to the lobby with it. He reassured us the truck would be safe, and told us where it would be parked. Later we saw him as we were walking out to find a place to eat, and he gave us so many recommendations for restaurants of great local food joints that we couldn’t possibly go to them all. And when it was time to leave, he made sure the truck was retrieved and created us by name when we got there. Great customer service, and just an all around I stayed at the Tempo by Hilton for five nights in October, during their soft opening, right before their actual opening. There was some construction outside still taking place the week before opening that made the entrance a little bit challenging to find. Fortunately, they had staff positioned at every potential point where a guest may have had a question.  I arrived a little earlier, prior to check in time and they were able to get me into a room. I was glad that I could leave my bags in my room and start my New York adventure.  The room is a little compact but it was fine because it was just me in the room. There is no closet, but rather a rack with hangers where you can hang stuff up, above where you can set your luggage on a ledge.  I loved the Bluetooth mirror in the Rooms very small for high prices.  Clean but the hotel is not prepared for the volume of guests.  Waited over 1.5 hours to get into a room after mobile check in and checking in at the desk in late afternoon.    Very Limited Amenities.  (I have spent probably 200 hotel stays in NYC as a point of reference). Great location right on Times Square. Quite even though you are in the center of everything. The staff was so helpful and friendly every time we saw them. The rooms were great and comfortable. Can’t wait to stay here for our next trip.  Highly rated for good reason. It's safe (hotel entrance is on the 11th floor and the elevator to it is manned 24/7.  Then, the guest elevators are separate). It's new, clean, and has a large lounge area attached to the lobby and bar/restaurant. Our room was delayed being cleaned and ready (it was the week before Christmas so it was very busy) but we stored our luggage and went about our day. Our room was on 22nd floor with Times Square views, and it was QUIET. Amazing hotel we will keep on our list for sure. If you want something in the middle of the Times Square action, close to subway, shopping, Rock center, Broadway, affordable, safe, new and clean, stay here. We loved this hotel that's right in Times Square. The staff were helpful, the bar area was wonderful, and the room was really nice (though typical-NY size). We were there for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade and were just one easy block from our spot on the parade route. What a gem! I had an amazing experience at the Tempo. The food is great, hotel is gorgeous, and the staff are super friendly! I highly recommend if you travel to NYC to stay here. I look forward to a future stay. The Cafe in the morning was great. Amin really did a great job making the items that we had ordered. He was very caring. The rooms were awesome. They had modern technology in the rooms that I have never seen at any other hotel I have just travelled back from spending a mini break here with my son and what a great hotel, clean,great location and comfy beds. We had the most amazing room overlooking Times Square and the rooms are so modern would stay here again. The only downside to my stay was on arrival at the airport to depart, when checking out of the room and asking to leave my bags in reception as we had a late flight the gentlemen offered a private vehicle SUV to take us to JFK, I asked how much and was quoted $120 all in, on arrival to the airport just outside the driver asked for payment and told me it was $160 plus tax and that I had been quoted wrong. The holiday was expensive as it is so to have this extra on top was something I could of done without and I would of rather of got a taxi as Very nice, modern hotel, located right in the heart of Times Square, on 47th and Broadway. Location is perfect, close to major attractions that are all within walking distance.  Our room was on the 36th floor and the elevators are really fast. We never had to wait for one. Our room was small but modern and was cleaned well daily. The bathroom amenities like the LED mirror with bluetooth and the rain shower fixture are superb. For the price we paid to stay at this hotel, it would have been nice to have at least some water bottles available in the room.  The hallways always smelled so nice and the hotel in general is kept very clean. Although this hotel was really good, we cannot give it five stars because of the following reasons:  1) The wifi is not premium high speed at all, so First time visit to NYC.  Traveled with my adult daughter and daughter in law. This is absolutely the best travel/hotel experience we’ve ever had!  Service was unbelievable. Accommodations were perfect. Clean, comfortable, great view.  Impressed with the room and bath. Staff were friendly and so helpful, and understanding to our every need.  Especially Bernard!  He gave us pointers, directions, and made sure we had transportation to places too far to walk.  I am 72 and use a walker.  He wad so gracious and caring in looking out for me.  In fact all staffers went above and beyond their responsibilities to  assure we had the best stay possible.  Truly a most amazing group.  I can’t thank them enough.  Only wish more places I visit could offer accommodations as wonderful as Tempo. Amin at the coffee shop was so kind!  We desperately needed coffee after our travels and even though he was about to close up he made us our drinks with a wonderful smile.  So gracious and we so appreciated him! I upgrade to a suite room totaling almost $5,000 for 3 nights. Beautiful but they lack the service on par with the price.  No water in the room and the only place you could buy water was in the lobby and it was out of order.  Stay somewhere else if you’re looking for value for your hard earned money. Not worth it. I am currently at this hotel and while it's rare for me to do review before leaving the location,  I think it's only fair to warn off as many people as possible from making the same mistakes as I have.   We arrived to Tempo on Saturday 16th December around 3:30pm.  We were told our rooms are not ready yet and to take a seat in the restaurant.  We waited around 45 minutes whilst the rooms were cleaned,  checked and made available..... which is not the end of the world.  But after travelling all the way from London we were ready for a rest.   And this is where the problems began.  The hotel WiFi was not working (and still not when I write this)  The hotel staff didn't seem bothered by this and couldn't understand why I was making a fuss or refusing to pay for the internet charge.  The hotel was fantastic. David, with the Bell Team, was phenomenal. He let us know exactly when we needed to head out for our flight. He had a car waiting for us and quoted us a fair fare, less than Uber. Thank you David for everything.  Loved this brand newish hotel right at Times Square. The room had many nice details like automatic opening window shades, beautiful bathroom tile, fixtures and a cool led lit mirror with a Bluetooth enabled speaker. The seven elevators were more than adequate and very fast. Practically no waiting time at all, even at busy times during the day and night. The front desk staff was very capable and helpful. We stayed on the 33rd floor and Times Square noise distractions were negligible. Had a great night sleep. Absolute abismal non existent response to telephone. - front desk Tried 7 times over three days ……after 11 mins on first and over 5 minutes on subsequent attempts have to havg up It doesn’t matter which menu choice you make they all appar3ntly go to front desk but nobody picks up No email address available to use either Have had to try and communicate the Expedia You would get better service from ymca…..,,,,,,!!! Outstanding staff! Every Tempo employee from front door to front desk and back was friendly, polite, and professional. Big shoutout to Deano, Miguel, and Hank.  Great mid-city location. Very clean. Fun entertainment in lounge.  i was pleasantly surprised with the hotels bar. i went to the tempo hotel to go meet up with some friends that were staying there, while i was waiting for them i went to the bar and had an amazing experience, Karina and Al took really good care of me. Karina gave me recommendations for drinks and food which were on point and Al always made sure i was doing good and if i was in need of anything at any point. they also had a live band which i truly enjoyed as well. if your ever in the tempo hotel i recommend checking out the bar This hotel is beautiful but what makes the experience is the exceptional service the staff provides. The door man was super sweet giving us tips on how to find Macy’s I think he was Italian. We had the best cleaning lady Norma M. Super sweet always checking in on us making sure we had everything we needed. She was simply a ray of sunshine ☀️! She made our experience exceptional! The only feedback I have for the hotel is provide your guests with access to water in every room. The other thing is definitely not enough staff at the check in counter and outrageous prices at cafe.  Even better  than the absolutely perfect location and the beautiful hotel was the incredible hotel staff. The friendliness, kindness, helpfulness and professionalism were phenomenal. Special thanks to Regina (security member) - you were wonderful to us and simply a joy. Thank you!  Super Friendly Staff! Tammy exceeded my expectations at check-in -Especially during the holiday season. We stayed 5 nights & rooms were super clean & housekeeping took care of room each day- excellent bedding - 40th floor with city view -loved the electric shades!  Yassin was so helpful & welcoming in the lobby & elevator area - highly recommend! Best stay ever - hotel is hip, classy and ultra comfy.  Love that staff - especially Yassin.  A kind gentleman helping staff in the lobby get up to their rooms with ease.  Great charisma and charm - hotel was an amazing stay!  Stayed here with my husband and niece and was impressed with every aspect. The location is impeccable with amazing views and even better customer service! Bo at the front desk went above and beyond in all aspects helping get us in the best room possible - even personally showing us the rooms view before deciding. All of security was so personable and would help with everything from getting the elevator or even a ride back to the airport in a crunch when you ride cancelled! Perfect first visit to NY all made possible by Tempo by Hilton. Would highly recommend!! Both my wife and I seperately called hotel for over 8 hours off and on today, with no answer. Around 2:00 my wife finally got someone to pick up where he said they were overwhelmed and put her on hold which eventually she was hung up on.  We even called the  Hilton 800 number and the customer service representative could not get through or get anyone to pick up either.  Finally we called the sales department.  The first time the lady was not helpful and just transfered us to a voicemail.  Left a message, no call back.  Finally called back to sales department again and got a different lady and she was very helpful.  Unfortunately we were trying to come in a day early and due to the delay in being able to speak to someone at the property we lost our chance to change our flights Excellent service at the restaurant specially from Henry he’s amazing and excellent customer service. The hotel it’s perfect very close to everything all attractions and very clean. We loved this place. We recommend this hotel 100 % ✅✅✅✅\"},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': \"I was a little surprised that I had to pay more money upon arriving, that the room was a bunk bed, and that the bathrooms were communal. But overall clean place for what I needed it for. If you are young and need a temporary stop, this is a great place. My boyfriend and I had a quick, over night layover in NYC and we stayed here and it was PERFECT. Around $100 for one of the twin bedrooms. It was definitely small, but totally perfect for the time we were there and for the price. We will definitely be back. Rooms and bathrooms were clean, location of Pod 51 was FANTASTIC.  Perfect location - just a 10 minute straight walk into Times Square. Far away enough to be out the way, close enough to be included in it all.  Rooms are a little small but very very clean and basic. You don’t spend much time in the room because there is so much else to do outside, but the beds are comfy, warm and the pillows are dreamy!  Bathroom is clean and all we needed. Dove shower gel, shampoo and conditioner and hand soap.  Heating was perfect for this time of year though it was a little loud. The mini fridge was perfect for our water bottles and snacks. Though the fridge also makes a noise every so often which sounds like a drill, but it only lasts for about 20 seconds!  Breakfast is included and was lovely! Lots to choose from though the dining area is small so I’d Great location, easy walk to major NY hotspots. Baggage assistance was extremely helpful, room service was perfect, and nice downstairs area. Overall very clean and nice staff. Bathroom was a bit small, but lots of closet space.  We stayed one week, it is a really great location. We have been looking for a good place with rReasonable price and nice area. Perfect match. And we loved the roof top. We are very happy, totally recommend you, thanks! Awesome place, especially if you are not in need of a huge hotel room. The room was comfortable enough, the beds were good and bathrooms clean. Excellent location, near Rockerfeller Center and other NYC attractions This place doesn't respect the client charging over rated prices compare to the room quality and not informing about very noisy work in the street. It  was impossible to sleep with these conditions. I will not recommand. This is a great hotel in a great location. Excellent value for money too! The hotel is very clean and well maintained. It’s located in a great spot close to Rockerfeller centre and Central Park. I will definitely be staying here again.  We stayed for 3 nights in a queen room. It was actually larger than expected, and since we had a corner room, the two windows were a surprise bonus.   The window into the bathroom is odd, and you do have to avoid accidentally seeing through to whoever is using the toilet. The space is otherwise well designed and well equipped. My requests for an iron (called down) and ice (asked at the front desk) were met with gracious and quick service.   An excellent location very close to subway stations, ess-a-bagel, and walking distance to Rockefeller center.   We would totally stay again and enjoy the simple, clean, affordable and welcoming accommodations at Pod51. The staff was extremely helpful and cordial. Cleanliness was very good. Staff deserves full stars. Had issues connecting to the internet but was helped by the front desk which resolved the issue. Sliding door of the bath did not work properly but all else was super good! Ok so it's NYC and the prices are high but our room, although clean, was about the size of an oversized closet. We did have a bed, desk, TV and the smallest bathroom you can imagine. It was about the size you expect in a mobile home - a tiny sink, a toilet stuck in a little tiny corner and a shower that you could barely move around in. Having said all that it is centrally located with a staff that appeared to be friendly. For the mid week price we paid and it was only for a night - not a bad deal. Don't think I would recommend this hotel since the room was a disappointment.  Pod room had a queen bed and a twin trundle bed. Great bed arrangement hard to find in any NYC hotel. The bad: hot water was extremely and dangerously hot. If I had small kids they would have seriously been burnt. The mattresses were too firm for all of us. The Pod we stayed in was in a separate brownstone walk up. Had to walk up three flights of stairs. Nowhere were we warned of this. Good thing we don't have mobility issues. Also, no egress other than that narrow staircase which is concerning had there been a fire. Paying $350 per day for a room where the bed barely fits and the room is in a bad overall condition is unacceptable. Despite requesting an upgrade or compensation, the manager did not grant it. After persistent efforts, we managed to secure a refund for the remaining 5 nights through booking.com. The manager's attitude was rude and unhelpful. Subsequently, we found a hotel for the remaining 5 days that is closer to the center, four times larger, $50 cheaper, and with significantly better amenities. This hotel was great - the room was well kept and had all the amenities I needed for my stay. Staff were friendly and helpful, and the location was very convenient to the locations that I wanted to visit while I was in Manhattan. Would definitely recommend to others! The room was tiny but with all the necessary . A bit expensive  even though it is cheaper than other hotels in the area. Staff was good and cleanliness was ok. Shower ok also.   This is everything I have to sáy The only bad thing is that the room was very hot even when I adjusted the thermostat it didn’t make a difference I called and ask for someone to help and no one came to help I didn’t hear anything everything was good expect for that one small problem which was our room was very hot or warm from time to time  The room is very basic and it does the job. Very small room and small bathroom. Our bathroom had a funny smell throughout our stay. It wasn’t pleasant but manageable. The room we was in the door was very thin and could hear everything in the corridor… would wake us up in the night. Overall it was an average experience. Thank you The experience was interesting and we were very pleased that the place was friendly and clean. We were also pleased with the location walking distance to many city attractions the subway was also close .  I think it was a good place to stay when I was gone most of the day. The only 2 concerns I have were the sound of pipes knocking during the night and the hardness of the bed. I  don't know what the sound was, but that's how I would describe it. Basic accommodation in a great location. The room was comfortable enough and the staff were awesome, very helpful. I will recommend to family and friends. Shame there is no relationship to local restaurants or a resident discount.  This is the cheapest hotel in New York but that’s not a bad thing The rooms were small and the bathrooms were communal but everything was clean and accommodating  Very walkable and there’s subway stations at the end of the street I enjoyed my stay The Pod 51 is located very centralised and the staff was very kind. Unfortunately, the room was not clean at all even after informing the stuff the room did not get really cleaner. For a short stay if would have been definitely okay but being there a week was quite long.  This Hotel did excatly what is said it would Clean, tidy and perfect location. The spec was as you would expect for the price compared to those around No complaints from us.  The coffee shop downside and the attached bar are ideal too Everything is very compact and modern, excellent staff, excellent location. We stayed in a room with a bathroom (many rooms have shared bathrooms), and our experience was excellent. The hotel's location and staff stood out.   Great Hotel, great located. All very friendly. Easy to reach. Will come again. Super roof top with a cool view. Really perfect. We wäre super happy with the hotel and we can recommend to all of you 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Great location,good value. Easy walk into the city, but very close to subway system. There is some great local cafes/restaurants/pubs. The hotel does have a cute Cafe that has coffee and breakfast options. The only negative were pillows were basic and the private bathroom was tiny. All in all would stay again.  The rooms were dirty with hairs on the bedding and towels. I had cockroaches in my room and the staff was not very receptive to helping me switch rooms initially. I would not recommend this place to anyone! We stayed for 6 nights & we had great service ! The best part is that the location was walking distance to all the places we needed to go to! The staff was very welcoming & helpful! We always had fresh towels & clean room when we got back, thanks to house keeping! Location is amazing, Radio City, Time Square, Central Park and many other things are walkable, or easy with the subway. Quiet hotel, clean rooms and bathrooms, we didn't see many other guests and there was never a wait time for the bathrooms  We reserved a room and Ended paying extra to change toma room with private bathroom. They should be emphatic in the fact that there are some rooms that does not have a private bathroom. We had to pay xtra to have a private bathroom. Live the area and I fell 100% safe. The hotel is very cool and the downstairs social area is SO COOL Rooms are great. It's small but it's great value and price for being so local withing the city. We just want to tour the whole time. It's a really safe place to rest our heads The room was very tiny. The pictures on the website were a bit misleading. Price/quality too much, even for New York City Staff was very friendly and helpful though. Very good location, close to many must do's! we had a lovely experience at pod 51. we greatly appreciated the twice daily maid service and the helpfulness and kindness of all the staff working there. “pod” sums it up - a small room with exactly what you need and not much more, pretty spot on with what we were looking for. there are also several subway stations close by the hotel which was extremely convenient, and had some yummy food right around the area.  Small room and shared bathroom was just ok for $250/night.  The location was good but there really isn't much to a pod.  I know it's difficult to find a good accommodation for not too much expense in NYC, but this was a bit much for a shared bathroom and a very small room.  The room did have a view I had a twin bed room and it was the perfect place to crash after a long day of walking and experiencing Manhattan. The sink in the room was a plus. Quiet and great room service. Walking distance to many attractions. The service was atrocious, the staff was awful, both the night and the day staff were unhelpful, uncaring charged me more on the checkout. I went with a friend and do not recommend it. Not a nice place. Perfect location and good services. Recommended for a short business stay. Cleanliness and staff very good. No issues. Rooms are quite small, perfect for solo travellers. Location is good if you want to walk around the city without getting public transports. Will definitely come back for my next stay!  Great location,  friendly staff and clean rooms. We stayed on the 3rd floor, where the room was quite dark and very noisy. Also, it felt cold, and we were unable to turn up the heating. Overall I would recommend Pod51 if you need an accommodation in the middle of Manhattan for a reasonable price and if you do not plan to spend a lot of time in your hotel room. The value of this hotel is excellent.  Small rooms, extremely well-thiought out and maintained, and in a most convenient neighborhood.  Staff from check-in, housekeeping, and taxi/luggage service were competent and friendly. Had a wonderfull stay. Nice location. Great staff and very close by 5th avenue and central park and felt safe. Even the hotel had a small breakfast options and drinks. I really recommend this place to other \"},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': 'This is the second time staying at this hotel all I can say is perfect location, excellent breakfast to start your day end of the day going back to a cleaned room  Staff are excellent very polite and always happy to help  We had 3 rooms booked for our family trip for my daughters birthday.   Request a certain floor and got it and asked for a different room type and got it. Fantastic welcoming service in check in.   We booked a junior suite and had access to the lounge which was very welcoming to get bottled water and other supplies. We stayed half board ( altho been told it’s stopping soon at the hotel ) and that was a godsend.  To save having to go out looking for meals that people wanted to eat. Buffet in the morning and night was perfect.   We had people in our party who had never stayed there before and they also loved it.  The breakfast was amazing as usual and loved the mix of going into the main restaurant and quieter one to try different surroundings.   The rooms are very clean and great Our stay at the Riu Plaza was really good. We had a room on the 14th floor which had a great view. The room itself wasn’t huge but you expect it to be in manhattan. The bed was big and very comfortable. The AC worked well and you are free to set it how you like it.  Breakfast was good, plenty of choice and quick to be seated even when it was busy.   There is an option for late check out which was really helpful as we had a late evening flight.   The hotel is well located and a quick walk to Times Square and various subway lines!   It was my birthday whilst I stayed and the hotel staff left a card and little birthday gift whilst we were out which was very unexpected and a nice touch.   Thanks Riu I stayed at this hotel with two friends at the end of November as part of my 50th birthday celebrations. It’s been a dream of mine to go to New York at Xmas time and I absolutely loved it and would love to come back. The hotel itself was great. Lovely room, comfy beds and the breakfast was fab. The reason for my 2 star rating is because I have had to put in a chargeback request with my card company to try and get my security deposit fee back which totalled $250. My friend enquired about an upgrade a few weeks prior to us going (as a surprise for me) and when told the cost ($250) she said she couldn’t afford it so they should have cancelled it there and then. I knew nothing about this until they mentioned it weeks after checking out. I myself enquired about fees prior to arriving I visited this hotel for my 50th birthday with my husband and friends. This was the first time at this hotel and I’m so glad we stayed here. The hotel is stunning and very clean. The staff were so helpful and even on the day of my birthday I received a card and chocolates to my room which was a lovely gesture. The breakfast buffet had an amazing selection. I would definitely stay her again and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. Overall the service was amazing especially from James on the front desk when we arrived .  Breakfast was really good and great choice of food . Rooms were good and cleanliness was of an excellent standard . Fab size towels . Great location  e stayed at the RIU plaza times square (305w 46th) we had had the breakfast there back in 2022, got to say I was disappointed we booked a deluxe room with a view it was tiny and the view was of a building site. There was no coffee or tea making facilities in the room, the first morning we had issues with the hot water ( there wasnt any) went to the desk at 630am to ask for help there seemed to be a language barrier when I said \\' we don\\'t have any hot water in our room\\' and was told there is none in any of the rooms and you get hot water at breakfast, took a good few minuets to get them to understand there was no hot water for a shower, we had a chap come up within 5 min who helped us out telling us to run the sink and the shower for 5-10 minuets and the hot water would come I love the breakfast, clean room, location. They were reasonable to refund me one night due to storm. The theater and restaurants are right there. The local avenues have markets, restaurants, bakery, whatever your heart desires!!! The one issue was handled and I would return. Superb location! The very best. Rooms large and plenty of space. Disappointing that no tea or coffee in the room, fridge in room.   Very helpful staff , clean and spacious.   Breakfast a little chaotic, very regimented although well organised. Plenty of choice and good fresh food as well as the ‘pile it high’ American style.   Be prepared to wait for the breakfast, but worth it, all self service buffet style.   Reception staff helpful.  Be warned the pre swipe of the card on arrival in reception is refunded two weeks later , even if you don’t charge to your room.   The traffic noise and sirens can disturb your sleep to start with , but you just get used to it! The sound proofing in the rooms could be better.   Cleanliness is good in the hotel.  The bar area is quiet but good.   Location is fine and that\\'s the only positive. Negatives: they nickel and dime you for anything, no tea or coffee in rooms, you pay extra for view but the view is terrible. The free breakfast is a joke, we are crammed like sardines, the tables are Never sanitized, the employees just wipe them down with a dirty rag that sits in their pockets.  One of the supervisors I guess ALBERTO has no customer service whatsoever and he needs to go. I asked him something and he said without looking at me \"that\\'s not possible\" and walked away. We are not guests in this hotel, we are just paying tourists and they don\\'t care about us. The bed has no comforter, just a very cheap and thin economy class plane blanket. New York has so many better opinions, if you want a good experience look elsewhere. Great location, close to restaurants, bars and Times Square. Fab breakfast with plenty of choice and always being replenished. One down side are the tables being very close together and felt like you were on top of the next table. Hotel clean and staff all pleasant and welcoming. Hotel is very loud overnight due to location there was lots of traffic noise. Rooms a little on the small side but everything you need in a room. Although no tea/coffee making facilities. Beds remade daily and cleaned. Fantastic service from start to finish. Everything was clean and tidy. The breakfast was everything you could want and more. Rooms are a little dated but nothing that would cause any issues. Beds are supper comfy. Well worth a stay. The Cleaning crew were fantastic. Well done RUI. Really nice hotel very clean and friendly staff also .the rooms are a good size and we had really good views on the top floor. The breakfast is very busy but we always got a table quick the only thing I would say is may the rolls bread and pastries would be better seperate as they were high  up and I had to lean over the bacon and hot food to get to them I only eat continental so it would just have been easier on a seperate counter near the cereal .reception staff very good especially Jamie who was very helpfull had a great time and would recommend as so easy to get everywhere from this hotel  Hotel just amazing very central gorgeous breakfast , they only issue we had was the bar staff not at all friendly just rude and would not encourage you to sit there and have a drink . They need to be more polite  We have just checked out and would definitely recommend this hotel. Location is perfect close to everything but not too close as you don\\'t hear the noise from Time Square. We got a room out the back of the hotel which was nice and quiet we didn\\'t hear a thing during the day or night. The room was big not what I was expecting after reading some reviews. We are a family of 3 and had loads of space there was space under the beds for suitcases a wardrobe and even a sofa. The room was spotless, cleaned every day. The hotel in itself was spotless and well kept in all areas. The staff were all lovely and helpful we had an issue with the window in our room we rang reception and was sorted within a couple of minutes. Breakfast was perfect if you are an early riser you miss the que but if Rooms could be larger for a family of four, but considering we were hardly in them It didn\\'t matter much.  Clean rooms with plenty of fresh linen everyday.  Breakfast buffet, lots of choices. Always hot food.  Great location near enough to Times Square but just far back to keep away from manic bustle which surrounds it. Staff friendly and helpful. Rooms good size. Breakfast was fab.  Bar and coffee bar attached also good Hello My Name is Carl Berry and I\\'m from Washington, DC. On December 29th, 2023 me and my family came to New York to watch the ball drop for the first time. It was a special event for me and my family. My Daughter who attends Morgan State University . Upon booking the reservation with RIU, we were told that whosoever booked the hotel room needs to show their ID at the front desk . Upon arrival I presented my Drivers License, my Major Visa credit card at the front desk to guest services, and i was told by guest services that all my family members had to show a form of ID. My youngest child is 11 and is in the 6th grade my 17 year old doesn\\'t have an ID either. The only person who had their ID\\'S were me , my wife and my College Student. Guest Services also told us we could not pay The most amazing hotel in the best location. Central to times square 10/10 and only a short walk to everything. The hotel itself was extremely clean and the staff were so polite. The buffet breakfast was gorgeous something for everyone!  2nd stay at this hotel. We upgraded again to the 26th floor with access to the lounge which we feel is worth the extra. The view from our room was fantastic and we had a little balcony (not that we’d use it that high up). Bed comfortable Thr lounge has water, coffee, tea, wine and fizzy cans available 24/7 as well as crisps, nuts, sandwiches, fruit and veg pots. Breakfast has a great choice, because of the time of year there was no quiet time to go it was constantly busy. Elevator were also especially busy in a morning.  Staff friendly and welcoming.  Christmas decorations were lovely 🎄 Really nice location of New York. Near to Time square and rock feller center too near. And breakfast is really well. Valuable much more breakfast. I disappointment one thing. Without parking lot.  I was paid more 100USD.   Very pleasant stay, comfortable, and clean. Staff were smiling and very good at their duty. Even crowdy at morning, everything goes well rapidly for having a very good breakfest. Many thanks to complete very nice quick family trip. Easy to recommend and we will.  We had done a fair bit of searching for a hotel close to Times Square and not too far from the fun/action.  Some reviews commented about the elevators being slow and also the breakfast having long lines. We were, admittedly, early risers but never had to wait longer than a couple of minutes to be seated. The buffet breakfast has something for everyone and was superb, this alone will save a family of four in excess of $100 a day easily.  The rooms are what you expect for a hotel in Manhattan, and anyone expecting a flowing suite is being unrealistic at the price point for the hotel. The beds were really comfortable and clean, everything we wanted, and needed, in a decent hotel.  We managed to get a late checkout, albeit only by an hour, on New Years Eve and the staff were always Would definitely recommend and would stay here again. Great location too, near shops, tourist locations and nice places to eat. The hotel was very organised and we didn’t have any issues with the lifts. From check in to check out everything was very good. Tips, if you want a slightly more relaxed breakfast  get up early before the crowds. Plenty of choice for breakfast which sets you up nicely for a day of walking. Location is excellent with plenty to do within walking distance. The room was comfortable with a good mattress, unfortunately New York never sleeps so expect some noise in the night/early hours. Staff are very attentive and eager to help. All in all a great experience. Beautiful hotel, great location. Comfortable beds and pillows. Very noisy room on 28th floor overlooking building works and the street (lots of bibbing & sirens). However didnt bother us as we live on a busy road at home, and also we were far too tired from the busy days walking, and fell asleep every night fine. Probably would bother light sleepers though.  Breakfast, lots of choice food wise. Hash brown fans.....you will be disappointed, so dry they were inedible. Decaf on the coffee machine never worked. Pancakes and bacon was great.  Hotel bar doesnt open until 5pm, a few times we wanted a beer at the hotel so either had to go out for one or have one in the coffee shop at the hotel.  Our room provided an iron and ironing board. But did not provide tea/coffee making This was our second stay at the RIU Plaza New York. The location is fantastic, the rooms are very clean and tidy and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The added bonus is that there is a breakfast buffet included in the package and has a generous selection of hot or cold food as well as cereal and fruit if preferred. The location is fantastic and is a short walk from Times Square, as well as help from the concierge or reception for planning trips and a bar where you could sit quietly in the evening if you wished to wind down from your day. Overall, the hotel made our trip to New York a very great experience and would definitely stay there again in the future. Very impressed with the service, room, breakfast, location and staff. Being so close to Times Square was a bonus and we had great views of 46th Street from our room. Enjoyed watching the hustle and bustle from above. Exceeded all customer expectations!!   Exceeded all customer expectations.  Amazing stay, incredible location (1x block from Times Square).  Well sized and equipped, modern rooms. No corridor noise so made for a great nights sleep. Good choice for breakfast and only ever a short wait (2mins) to be seated at peak times 8-9am. Slight re layout needed of breakfast areas as everything in the 1x area so can queue for items and drinks located in middle of queue for hot food which is unnecessary. Spotlessly clean hotel and always a welcoming face on reception. Great stay!  Just got back from this hotel from a 4 night break for my 50th - wow what a hotel rooms were super comfy and amazing views of the city - small fridge in room the only thing I missed was a kettle but no big deal breakfast started at 7am and a Starbucks was across the road  Litrally right on doorstep of Times Square and 5-10 min walk to rockerfellar and radio city - 10 mins walk to 5th Avenue and 15 mins to Empire State Building subway 2 mins to get to ground zero and Statue of Liberty   Hotel staff very helpful   Breakfast great loads to choose from although gets busy after 8am but don’t have to wait too long   This hotel is perfect location we stayed on 18th floor - lifts really quick so no waiting around  woukd recommend this hotel to anyone  This is our annual Christmas Broadway Bash and we usually stay in a hotel near Times Square. This year we chose Hotel Riu to spend our two nights in the city. This hotel is conveniently located near restaurants, public transportation, major Broadway theaters and walking distance from Rockefeller Center and Central Park. The hotel staff is friendly, courteous and professional. The interior is clean and spacious for people to hang out in. The exterior is a great place to wait for taxis and near some great restaurants. Our room is quite comfortable and has a great view of 8th Avenue, overlooking some great skyscrapers. Quite enjoyed this place. Took advantage of their delicious breakfast buffet. Will definitely stay here again!  Had a great 5 day break before Christmas 🤶  When we checked out on Friday 21st December 2023 we were advised the deposit of $200 dollars would be refunded back into our debit account within 24 hours. However we are still waiting. Please advise??? Regards  Thomas Jamieson  Room 512 Our stay at the Riu NY Times Square was very pleasant.  The staff, except for the front desk staff, were quite pleasant and helpful.  The room was great.  The location was perfect.  The breakfasts were magnificant. Excellent hotel, friendly staff, clean and fresh looking. Breakfast excellent operated like a military operation to keep things running smoothly. Just loose the glass bathroom screen as bit of a strange design leave the bathroom light off and your fine thou. All the staff are amazing, really friendly. Excellent location. Breakfast is actually very good, although small room for the amount of people staying at hotel.  The negatives are the size of the bedrooms my room at home is bigger. It\\'s tiny. Couldn\\'t even open suitcase on the floor. Bathroom is just glass surround. So your partner or who ever you travelling with can hear you going toilet etc.... the room was either boiling hot or freezing cold. Didn\\'t replace water in the room either.  Deposit has also taken over 2 weeks to come back to us.  I\\'ve re booked New York for Halloween but choosing to stay near Central Park instead this time.  For £1900 for 4 nights I expected a little more! What a wonderful experience.  Everything was just as expected making our trip most enjoyable.  The breakfast buffet was all anyone could ask for and the advice to get there early was well advised; even though it moved along when we did arrive a little later. Hotel excellently placed to enjoy New York, not even a long walk if coming off public transport at PENN Station. 2 blocks from Times Square. just be mindful of hotel website room images, as they do not reflect actual rooms you are allocated. We asked for a room with corner views - discussed via e-mail with hotel, but on arrival not allocated such a room. discussed with reception and they informed me that room on website was not what is classed as room I asked for. The image is classed as a junior suite by reception desk. Fantastic hotel located in between Times Square and Hells kitchen - so food and shopping covered! Hotel also has a cafe open until 9:30 pm for a nice cuppa and snack if you fancy as well as a bar that closes later. Highly recommend this hotel spotless clean beautifully decorated ( we visited in Dec ) lovely staff fab atmosphere delicious breakfast and perfect location. We had a brilliant time and cant wait to go again next year.  Not worth the money.  The rooms are tiny and extremely basic.  No comforts whatsoever.  No room service no restaurant.  It is a very expensive B&B.  Location is ok but that’s about it. Would not recommend or stay again.'},\n",

Stayed with my husband and 2 adult daughters on a 4 day stay in New York.  Everything was amazing in this hotel. Clean, very comfortable beds and friendly, efficient staff. Wonderful location just 5 mins walk from Times Square.  Worried about the lift situation but this hotel is trying hard to address this problem and we atno time had to wait more than a few minutes. Would definitely return. Thanks The hotel only has two working elevators and suggests that guests use the service elevator while repairing the problem. The elevators have been broken for well over a month. Long lines to get to guest rooms unless guests use the smell service elevators! We stayed at the Park Central the first week of January.  The location of the hotel is awesome for exploring Central Park, 5th Ave. and the theater district.  Time Square is a reasonable walk as well.  And if you don't want to walk, the subway is the best deal in town and easy to use.  The room was nice; big by NYC hotel standards.  The bathroom was a bit tired and the lighting was a challenge for make up application.  The biggest challenge while there was one elevator being down.  That meant sometimes long waits on to have the doors  open and the car would be full.  We used the steps a couple times but 11 floors of stairs was exhausting after a day of walking all over NYC.  All in all, still a nice stay.  There is a deli on the corner that has the BEST choco mousse style layer We booked via British Airways for a pre Christmas family visit. BA had advised in our itinerary that there were lift issues and we had seen the problems flagged within the reviews. On arrival our room was ready and whilst a little tired and in need of some decorating it was perfectly adequate for sleeping. Which is all you really need it for. We were also given a bottle of wine and 2 glasses as it was my birthday the day before arrival which was a nice touch. The wait for the lifts was never more than 5-10 mins. We did take the stairs a couple of times and were directed to service lift once which seemed perfectly fine. I can safely say we had a great time. The hotel is in a fantastic location to access Times Square and Central Park. You know the situation you before you arrive The lifts were being upgraded, so guests could only use two service lifts for the entire hotel (unless they were willing to walk up stairs).  The lifts were located next to where the garbage was stored, so it stank whenever the lift reached the ground floor. Because there were only two lifts, it took forever to catch one.  We had to share it with the staff who were sometimes moving stuff up and down the floors which meant the space in the lifts got super tight.  We could not receive a WiFi signal our room as it was at the end of the corridor, whereas the router must have been closer to the centre part of the hotel.  The safe in our room had no batteries.   The only cups we got were cheap plastic ones. We could not make any drinks in the room as they didn’t provide tea or coffee This was our first stop in new york, the place was great the people are great. The only complaint about this is the elevators, as there is a long wait every time to use them. Within walking distance to times square. I made reservations a month and a half in advance. We arrived a day early because our flight was early. We decided to make a separate reservation and stayed at the hotel for one night. When we tried to check in for our next stay, the hotel stated that our reservation was for the week prior and it was cancelled for a family crisis. When I spoke to my travel agent they said that the reservation was acting for 1/13-16.  We think the hotel cancelled because the dates were wrong on their end and we didn't even have the internal reservation number but only the travel agent number.  Stayed here in from the 1st to 4th January and after my initial booking with British Airways was very skeptical due to the review I had read on Tripadvisor.  BUT.....we  could NOT fault our stay in anyway.  The room (1102) was exceptionally clean, spacious for a city hotel with good amenities.  The bed was just superb! hot showers every morning and daily maid service too, what's not to like.  As we were only in the city for a short period, we did not sample the hotels facilities i.e gym, restaurant/bar but the front of house staff were lovely!, kind, helpful and welcoming.  On reading other reviews, there were lots of negative surrounding the lifts and return of deposits, whilst i appreciate the lift issue could cause a concern, I do not feel that it caused us any inconvenience, Great location and nice staff. I came early but did not have problems with check-in.  There are problems with elevators and AC in the room. The rest was good.  Especially it is very close to the center of the city. The elevators are undergoing maintenance. However, this was not communicated to customers in advance, leading to great disappointment. Arriving and leaving the hotel is a terrible experience, with long queues. The hotel should be more transparent with customers communicating in advance what is happening. A poster asking for understanding and apologies is not enough when there is great expectation. First off I need to say i have stayed in this hotel with various friends and family groups, almost annually, for almost 15 years. I absolutely adore the hotel, love the location and convenience. Unfortunately on this occasion it was a complete and utter disaster. We had three different rooms in 4 nights. The first room had a malfunctioning heating (air con?) unit. We could not turn the unit off. We thought we adjusted it and went out for the night and came back to a sweltering hot room. It was blowing out warm air. We had to leave the window open a fraction to literally be able to breathe normally. Apart from the obvious New York traffic noise, my sister is asthmatic and was in a lot of pain and discomfort all night. The presence of a tower style plug in fan in the room (that I Overall this hotel was good for a 5 night stay in NYC however, the rooms are nothing like the photos!   Good points - location was brilliant, close to Central Park, Times Square, Hell’s Kitchen etc! We walked literally everywhere.  - staff are super friendly, welcoming and helpful. Upon checkin the room assigned to us hadn’t been cleaned from the previous guests. Reported this to reception and they rectified straight away and gave us complimentary drinks for the inconvenience. These things happen and we weren’t stressed about it so the the drinks were a nice touch.  - WiFi is good and included  - taxi availability was brilliant for leaving for the airport they are all lined up outside - price was very reasonable for NYC  - luggage storage was secure and great to use before Booked through British Airways, this is listed as a 4 star hotel, they must have achieved that status many years ago as the hotel was barely a 2 star. It is quite honestly shocking and dangerous, not to a decent standard at all. We had many things wrong with the room and hotel, we reported issues on day 1 but some were not rectified until day 2 and others not at all!!  At check in we were not told that the elevators are out of order for descent from floors and that we would have to use the service elevators. The service elevators and corridors leading to them were quite smelly and small and not easily accessible. Apparently work has been carried out in the elevators for the last year at least with no end in sight!   We had booked two rooms that were both two double bed rooms. On It was a great hotel near to the Central Park and Time square for the new year days. Hotel so fine - room and bed are so good.  And the members are so kind - Especially VITO. I would like to thanks VITO for his Help  Mr DURAN Olivier Park Central Hotel 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼   Just about to leave the hotel after 5 nights. Check-in was smooth and staff were helpful. Room, standard size with two queens beds, very comfortable and water always hot. Fridge in the room too. Room was very warm but we turned off the heating which made it ideal for us.    Front of house and lobby very nice.   The lifts which seem to be a big issue, honestly no complaints. Waiting the usual time for a lift. We did use the service lifts sometimes too. Yes they were service lifts and sometimes you had to share them with hotel employees, carts etc but everyone was very nice and pleasant.   Extended our hotel room on check out day too, again no problem and organised very easily.   Location is fab.   All in all a great stay.  Awesome 7th Avenue location, between Central Park and Times Square!  Broadway close!  What a city.  Checked in super-early.  Later, we asked to move rooms - went to reception and no questions asked, they moved us immediately.  Very good customer service, thank you.  We looked down onto 7th Avenue and that was magic for us to see people moving around.    It was great to have a  bath.  No fridge or tea / coffee making facilities, plastic cups only, a NYC thing?  Ice machine down the hall.    Room for improvement?  The elevators are a disaster! We recently stayed for 5 nights at this hotel. Although the location was good for walks to Central Park, Times Square or 5th Avenue shopping, we encountered some significant issues during our stay. Most notably, they deducted from my credit card a $500 smoking fee for no reason. I informed the hotel that we do not smoke and that we are willing to take any nicotine (or other) test to prove this fact. They said that won't be necessary, but then did not refund me, and ignored subsequent communications from us on this topic. Other (less serious) issues were iffy wi-fi, offline elevators forcing long wait times for service elevators, strange aircon settings that only provided heating, and very limited on-premise eating options. Based on the location, I could maybe still have We stayed 4 nights between Christmas and New Years 2023 and chose this hotel primarily for the location and the fact they had the option of rooms with two queen beds.  When we arrived we discovered half of the elevators were under construction and inoperable.  We were on the 10th floor.  It was not unusual to wait 8-10 minutes for an elevator, and we often just chose to take the stairs because it took less time.  We were not made aware of this at booking, upon arrival or asked about our stay at any point.  If you book here be sure to either ask for a lower floor or make sure the elevators are all operational. Lovely hotel in great location not to far from things but quite enough to sleep at night, staff polite and alway willing to help, we celebrated a special anniversary and our room was decorated on arrive with balloons ect also bottle of champagne, chocolate dipped fruit and a lovely card from the hotel, extra touch go along way, Rooms as big enough for what you need, comfortable bed, tv, hairdryer, and general shower accessories, you can also request a fridge and kettle if needed, maid service good and staff also chatting when they see you making you fell welcome, this is our second stay in this hotel and we will definitely return when next in the city.  I love the location and the fact that it has 2 queen beds but the elevators are being worked on and we would have to wait a long time every time to get an elevator. Because of this I will probably stay somewhere else until that gets fixed. What a wonderful hotel . My wife and I stayed for 3 nights right before Christmas . The location is perfect ( literally 2 min walk from Central Park and about 5 mins to the rink , 7-10 mins to Times Square  . The staff were so friendly ( especially the bar staff , we enjoyed drinks in the bar each night before we went out ) and the room was clean and had the nice hotel smell. The Elevators were out but as others have mentioned , they are doing their best with allowing guests to use the service elevator .  We never had to wait more than 5-7 mins and this really didn’t impact our trip. We enjoyed the fresh cool breeze with the window open each night and it really wasn’t loud at all. I find the New York City noise really relaxing . If I had to say anything negative and only very Be ready to wait 30 min to use the one elevator available. Crazy to think this hotel is still considered 4 stars. I would not recommend. The other elevator needs to be fixed. Very disappointing experience. Definitely not worth the price, only upside is location.  We arrived early from the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal so we’re not expecting to be able to check in for hours, just to drop our bags. Marcia went above and beyond in welcoming us. She found us a room straight away and it was an upgrade too, after noting my comment about a 50th birthday trip. Thank you so much! We stayed for 3 nights over Christmas and found all the staff to be very friendly. The room was spacious, well equipped and clean. The only criticisms were that is was very poorly lit and there was no coffee machine. We didn’t have to wait too long for the elevators but chose the stairs mostly, being only on the 6th floor. The hotel was in a great location, a short walk from everything and with numerous delis nearby. Be careful dear traveler they try to steal your money charging a ghost “smoke tax”. In my family nobody smokes and they show to you a sensor graphic with the proof of smoke with time, date but not the room number in evidence… the problem was also that in the date of the graph we were at the Moma (we conserved the tickets). To avoid Had to change room, because the first one smelled horrible. The second one was awful as well. Dirtly, hairs in the bathroom. Had blood (or chocolate) stains on the sheets, and to top it off, the staff at front desk is the MOST RUDE and unpolite I have ever encountered. Besides, their elevators are not functioning properly. The ONLY advantage of this hotel is its location, but I would NEVER stay here again. The worst experience and place we’ve ever stayed at. Whoever was handing out stars the day this place got 4 stars must have had stars left over to give cause we’ve seen better 2.5 star budget hotels than this.  The good: - The location. You can walk to everything  The bad: - everything else - lifts don’t work so add 5-10 minutes on every trip - only found out lift doesn’t come to our floor from other guests (had to use service lift) - staff are rude, passive aggressive and condescending - check in is unpleasant. No assistance or help with anything - room was filthy - dirty socks left in cupboard - toe nails on the floor - windows so dirty you can barely see out them - hair and dirt in bathroom and bathtub - lock on bathroom door doesn’t work - gap in bathroom door so no privacy Dated hotel, staff was pleasant enough. Only elevator working for a 17 floor hotel is totally unacceptable and most definitely a massive health and safety issue. Resort Fees are a joke and should be refunded until the hotel is working at 100% So as with many of the other reviews yes lift situation is not good!  Luckily I wasn’t on the top floor so I did used the stairs daily which was a struggle after already walking over 20000 steps each day If I’d had a pram or disability then obviously this would’ve been more of an issue for me. I did see and hear many people who I believe could’ve easily used stairs but said they didn’t want to!  Check in I was greeted by a rude woman who wouldn’t take my resort fee by cash. I’d emailed hotel prior to my arrival to confirm how much my daily fee would be so I had this amount on my credit card. On arrival I was told it would be $400 which I explained I didn’t have on credit card so would pay in cash she said this wasn’t an option. Having left  home 29hrs earlier and my trip had We stayed there for 10 days. Generally, it was a pleasant experience except for two things. Firstly, while the room was made everyday in terms of making the bed sheets, the floor did not seemed to have been vacuumed daily as there were obvious traces of dirt and dust balls on the floor. There were also two days where the room was not made. Secondly, the staff manning the front desk gave us the impression that they were impatient and rude by giving us slipshod answers in a nonchalant manner,  and on one instance one of them simply pointed to the restroom card without even bothering to serve us properly when we requested for it. While we are unsure if such behavior is the norm, it should not be acceptable especially when serving customers. Amidst the not-so-good pointers raised, Room décor is rough - time to re do.  Elevators Not working - took forever to get up and down to the lobby.  We were not told at the time of booking... they said it should take 2 years to get all of the elevators refurbished!  This hotel is not bad ,the location is OK and the rooms are bearable. The main problem is that just one elevator is working ,which causes an absolute chaos during pick times. Me and my family waited 40(!!) minutes and had to walk down via the stairs for 4 times!!! The hotel excuses are absolutelly unacceptable and the management must close the hotel untill the elevator system is back to normal. We will never return here!! Hotel looks great when we arrived, David the doorman was so friendly during our stay, helped with bags, flagged down taxis when we needed one etc etc  Checked in at reception, went to get in a lift and discovered a huge queue as only one lift was working. I have no doubts there will be numerous reviews on this so I won’t dwell on it. However it really was a pain, at times my wife having to take one of the kids and go first as there wouldn’t be enough room having waited 10-15 mins each time.   The hotel rooms are clean but worn, light switch was hanging off, doors delaminating, carpet shrunk, bath plug didn’t work etc. Beds were extremely comfortable however and on the 17th floor we had a semi decent view of the front, kids loved listening to the hustle and bustle of NY at night. We have visited New York numerous times before, our last visit was 6 years ago and we have stayed in a different hotel on each visit. Park Central Hotel was by New York standards very modern inside, very pleasantly surprised by the decor, good food and service, very clean and the location was amazing. Close to Central Park and 5th Avenue and within walking distance of everything. Would stay again, highly recommended. I stayed at this hotel for 7 nights, and I really wish I could give the hotel a better rating, but with all good consciousness I can’t.  Firstly let’s do the positives.  The staff, especially Betty, were very helpful, and polite. I’ve stayed at other hotels in the city, and they weren’t half as polite as the team at this hotel.  Now the negatives.  The lifts. How can you have only one lift working in a hotel with 20+ floors. I appreciate that maintenance needs to be carried out, but there has to be a better way of doing this, especially when you have 4 lifts. The alternative was to use the ‘service elevator’s’, which was hardly ideal, as you are using the lifts with the staff. You could tell that the staff were just as frustrated by this situation. Who ever authorised these This is my second time to stay at Park Central (and the last). One working elevator to reach all floors and a second that only went up to the 10th floor. Why choose peak travel time to update all of your elevators?? And THEN to charge a $190 destination fee for use of facilities/WiFi??? Unreal. That fee should be refunded immediately. On top of that, I was charged $500 over the amount on the paper bill and when I inquired, the overage was simply reversed. No explanation or apology. Same with the other guests we were traveling with-$400 overage and simply reversed no explanation. Seems shady to me. The rooms were mildly clean but the air conditioning didn’t work and the rooms get very stuffy and hot. Hallway carpet is stained-front desk staff is mildly friendly but not anything Great location to explore downtown. Within walking distance of Central Park / Times Square / Rockerfeller center and Subway etc. Unfortunately there were a few technical issues with the AC and TV in the room not working properly which was a shame after a long day of walking. Also, issues with the elevators being renovated which we were unaware of before our stay. Only 1 small elevator for our side of the building made for a interesting closeness with your fellow guests at any time of the day lol ! Excellent position and big rooms, anyway the long cues to the elevators are unacceptable. Half of the lifts are having overall, but this is creating very long waiting times to move in the hotel. Rooms are big, but they also need maintenance. Bathroom included. The service was great (Anna helped us). The staff was friendly and accommodating. Outside of that, there was nothing good about the stay. The lounge and its food restrictions wasn’t guest friendly, most of the days it was roped off for Turkish Airlines. The mattresses are old (could feel springs) so even after a room change the issue remained. The same elevator that was out of service 2 years ago is still down, creating a nightmare trying to move to and from our room. We mainly relied on a service elevator which also became crowded, with long waits. We were also in a room that seemed like there was no sound proofing from the outside. Multiple nights we were awakened by sirens, honking and or metal banging. We decided shortly after our arrival that we won’t be going back unless The elevator is broken only 1 is working everything is ugly we left 3 days before the end . We hope and we ask to be refunded . Don’t go to this hotel . Run fast . It’s a shame . My room was dirty . The heat broken 😡 it was so warm with a lot of noise . I could not switch off the air conditioning \"},\n",

The rooms are bare of basic amenities IE coffee and complimentary water. The breakfast buffet was over priced at $44.99 a person, our group would have spent $200 a day just on breakfast. So plan accordingly.  Hyatt Grand Central NY was fantastic. The staff was friendly and approachable, the room was amazingly comfortable, roomy and clean. The location is perfect, as it is right next to GCT, and only a few blocks from Bryant Park. I look forward to going back in the near future.  It was fine, but not in great shape for the price. Also, if you are used to fluffy, comfortable, or even warm blankets - don’t expect those. The bed  had a very thin duvet and a sheet. In January. In Midtown. Upon arriving, check-in was smooth, facility was clean! Everyone was hospitable! I would more than likely stay here again on my next visit to New York City! Being next to the Grand Central station, grabbing a taxi was not difficult at all! Hyatt handled a complicated series of reservations and needs for children and grandchildren and friends, requiring different types of rooms and adjoining rooms, coming and leaving at different times but all centered around a certain date, managing to placed us all on the same floor.  Very responsive when a forgotten item was left in one of the rooms..  Average hotel. Staff were friendly.   We travelled as two adults, a ten year old and five year old. The twin room was too small and we had to upgrade to two rooms. Common for New York.  Rooms cleaned daily.   We had trouble sleeping as the rooms aren’t sound proof and were constantly woken up by people in the corridor or all through the night by traffic, despite being on 22 floor.   Location is good and subway is close. Hyatt Grand Central New York is located in the Grand Central station building and thus giving direct access to the station and only minutes away from fifth avenue and midtown attractions and restaurants. The hotel lobby area is large with a nice atrium with plenty of seating, access to the restaurant and bar and a marketplace for food and drinks. On the 16th floor is the Commendore study, which is a blend of an executive lounge and a co-working space with free coffee, soft drinks and snacks which as both indoor and outdoor space. The gym is located on the top floor and has a good selection of equipment and weights. The rooms are nice and modern with good but small bathrooms. If you want bigger rooms then select the corner suites as you get a good size room with living and The Hyatt Grand Central was a nice hotel with a great location!  You could walk to so many things right from there or travel via Grand Central if needed.  My room was nice, and I did not really hear the traffic at all (I was near the back of the hotel).  Check in was easy.   I had a bad experience staying at the Hyatt Grand Central. I stayed with my family in 3 rooms for 11 days. The safe was not working and we reported it from the first moment and on several occasions but they did not help us repair it. The reservation was made in 2 events, with 2 reservation numbers with the Hotels agency but the reservation was duplicated and then they told us that it was not made and we had to talk to the hotel manager and the people from Hotels so that they could come to an agreement because the Hyatt system did not receive the reservation. On one occasion in the last few days, the card did not open the room and my husband had to go down to fix the card and they told him that it was ready but when he went up he still couldn't open it, this happened to him more We stayed here for 5 days in January. Good points, the location is brilliant, so handy for Grand Central and sell the amenities.  Could improve.. no basic drink making facilities in the room, was not told when booking through BA that the hotel would want a 400 USD deposit paying on checking in. The reception staff did not explain this either and just put a charge straight on the card, this could really spoil a holiday if you needed to use that money. In addition there was a resort fee, what this was for I don't know as there were no amenities provided. Everything including bag storage, was chargeable.  The hotel then gives you a credit of 15 USD a day to spend in their shop, this only covers 2 drinks a day.  However, the room and bathroom were very nice and rhe door staff were Lovely clean rooms , beds made and fresh towels each day. Good location staff on the door 24 / 7 so really safe. Grand central market “ too good to go “ bags are a must and pizza shop on 43 rd street opposite Lexington exit to subway lifesaver on first night ! 99 c a slice - hotel seemed cool with everyone bringing own food back. Only slight negative - check in - fees should be made clearer at this point, weary travellers are somewhat disempowered and just feel obliged to hand over credit card with no explanation or what is being taken ( they didn’t need my PIN to take a 400 dollar hold ) - when we were more awake next day at 05:30 ( 😂) we did ask for an explanation which was approx 40 dollars a night damage hold and the rest is a tax / or enhancement fee as they called it . Hotel is situated next to Grand Central Station and is the perfect location for seeing New York.  Transport options are easily accessible (Train, Bus, Taxi or Uber) and if you like walking as we did we walked for miles.  ,THEY NOTIFIED ME ABOUT A PAYMENT AT THE HOTEL BUT NOT OF A PROTECTION PAYMENT OF 100 DOLLARS PER DAY WHICH WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU 3 DAYS AFTER LEAVING THE HOTEL.  AND  It was unpleasant for me to do my check-out and ask to leave my suitcases for a few hours in the lobby at a time when I was doing some shopping near the hotel and they wanted to charge me an additional 35 dollars for my suitcases, after having spent 3 nights in his hotel. I was not satisfied with the customer service, the cleanliness of the bathrooms, the quality and comfort of the sheets and pillows. In short, some very important things for the client to feel satisfied Good hotel to sleep.  Below the hotel there is also a train station and metro station (Grand central Station).  Good with public transport.  You can exchange money across the street, which is also handy.  Diagonally opposite is also a supermarket and it is on your left.  Further on on your right is MC Donald and Chick-fil-A Staff were great, room was clean as was the rest of hotel, room could do with a bit of work wall paper coming off wall and bathroom tiles could do with re grouting. No tea/coffee facility’s provided in the roomWe never eat in the hotel as breakfast ect was a bit expensive $45.00 for breakfast Dirty room apparently was never vacuumed. Mini fridge full of dust. Hair on the floor. Ripped sheets  I do have pictures as proof  —— they changed my room but still dirty ….. 2nd room AC vent was DIRTY—- they need to do better on the floor supervision  Booked a Suite room for 2 adults and 2 kids, room provided only had a double bed. When I asked about beds for the kids was told I must pay $40 per bed per night for rollaway beds. The hotel manager was condescending, unhelpful and just blamed the airline through whom we booked.  The hotel is not clean and has almost no amenities. The rooms do not include some necessities like toothbrushes. We called the reception three times to bring toothbrushes to the room, but no body showed up.  Careful with the $15/room/day they say is included with your room. It's not. They will charge you for it separately once you leave.  The hotel is old, run down and overall not nice to stay at. Most of the front desk staff are very rude.  Don’t hesitate too book if you get a chance will regret for or because the price if it for Vacation or Business the staff as well has it’s Room service great , accommodation, accessibility to transportation to the City Shops and food  We had great experience staying there for four nights, the suite room is big in NYC with good conditions. Staff is responsive and friendly. Will definitely consider them again in the future NYC visits.   Paint chipping off the trim. Old furniture in the rooms. Just not what I would expect for a Hyatt Hotel. The 15$ voucher each day you would think to be a nice perk. Except when you see the choices. The people were nice just thought the experience could be better.  The hotel is located next to the Grand Central Station, so it is easy moving in the city. Room was fine and well cleaned, there is also a internal market where you have 15$ credit every day. Reception personnel seemed to be indolent. The hiker is very good located nice lobby area but the room was average nothing to impress and the bathroom the toilet is very low and the vanity was worn out  also I have to live early because the storm caming to New York and I ask if I can get some money back tour my bill sine my reservation wast no refund and they don’t do nothing about oven I was don’t wand any money back and they charge me additional 155 dollar  is all ok but they don’t do nothing to take care me  I stayed here for 5 days around the New Year. The location is convenient to seeing Manhattan. But that's about the only positive. The bathroom is so poorly arranged that there is zero counter space and nearly impossible to brush your teeth over the tiny sink. They gave us one itty bitty shampoo and one itty bitty conditioner, which were never replaced during our stay - they were empty after day 2. I requested daily maid service, and they did make the beds daily. But they only gave fresh towels on 2 of 5 days. The AC/heater vents were caked with dust - looked like a years worth at least. So much stuff permanently embedded in the carpet! Yech. Breakfast buffet way overpriced and just average. I usually love Hyatt, but I would not stay here ever again. Travelled as a family with two children ages 4 & 14.  Booked this hotel with a package from BA. It was one of the cheapest hotels so I didn’t expect much, just somewhere to get our heads down however we were pleasantly surprised, it was fab!  Food in the market was nice (although pricey but everything is in the tourist areas of New York) - pizzas, Mac and cheese, bagels, Starbucks hot drinks etc all available. Didn’t visit to restaurant so can’t comment. Location was perfect, right next to central station. Never heard any noise though! We were able to walk to Central Park, Times Square, empire state, Rockefeller tree. Got a taxi to 9/11 which was easy to get as there are multiple yellow taxis outside the hotel.  Rooms clean. Lovely big bathroom and huge tv. Fridge in room which From the moment we checked in into the moment we left and everything in between our stay was just amazing. The hotel made our holiday even better and we will most certainly be recommending it to everyone who visits New York and will definitely be returning  Unpleasant but located centrally  Leta start with the $40 location resort fee (whatever it’s called). There is NO CREDIBLE JUSTIFICATION for it aside ripping you off with a hidden fee. This is not a resort. There is no amenities. Front desk tell you you get free WiFi, free long distance etc boy! It’s not free if you pay for it.  Rooms are ok. Bare bone. Clean  The market is a tiny place with below average food and above average prices. Avoid it   I am an elite Hyatt member. I tried this one because of the price. Never again. The size of our room was perfect, there was space for luggage and to move around in the room. It was relatively clean and comfortable too. Would be good if they included bathrobes and slippers. Great location. Overall location was fantastic, walking distance to a number of sites including Time Sq, 5th Ave, Rockafeller etc. Services within the hotel was poor, lack of towels in room, rooms not cleaned, complained a number of times before action was taken, bar & restaurant closed over NYE & NYD when the hotel was busy with people!   Well central hotel to everything: access to the subway, meals, stores and other areas. Broad buffet breakfast There are access to many food options very close to the hotel: In case of not opting for breakfast included Good Gym View: regular Only things: 1. I would like to have a coffee machine in the room 2. I would have liked some activity sponsored by the Hotel on Christmas Day and December 31. They did not offer activitities Beware! This place is way to expensive for the rooms quality (old and very dirty) ... You can't get another blanket, they don't clean rooms every day and everything is dirty!!! You can't use lockers because they are not cleaned and everything is damaged!  And they don't like you as customers: they don't even let you leave early! They force you to pay then extra nights so you must stay :-(( very sad to see such a bad customer experience.. we spoke to the manager several times: they will not help you. Our friends should move to another room and that was even more dirty! Such a joke and you can't leave :-(((  It is a total rip off! Stay away ! ... Never again hyatt! The staff was very rude the rooms are dated. I hope everyone one else has a better experience than I did. I for one will never stay at a Hyatt again. I checked out early and found a different place to stay  Recently stayed at Hyatt Grand Central hotel and had an underwhelming experience. The internet was frustratingly slow, the room was overpriced for its quality, noise levels were disruptive, and there were limited activities available. Overall, not the ideal stay for the price paid Love staying at this property.  Very spacious rooms, relaxing lobby, and friendly staff.  This location is right by Grand Central Station where you can easily access multiple train lines whether you want to head out Uptown, Downtown, Brooklyn, and other parts of the city.  Nice restaurants within .5 mile and Rockefeller Center is just half a mile away.  Also, Summit at Vanderbilt is just around the corner, Bryant Park is about 2 blocks away as well as the NYC Public Library.  Times Square, Hells Kitchen are less than a mile away and if you are up the challenge, Central Park is about a mile away.   Not a hotel I would recommend if you have a special event planned. I had a much better experience in a £50 a night Premier Inn than in this $750 a night hotel. The staff were rude and unhelpful. The $35 snacks and drinks was at best average with no variety. We recently stayed at the Hyatt Grand central and we were very disappointed with the service and fees. I had booked a triple deluxe room with my agent and paid extra for this room compared to my sister who booked the king deluxe. On arrival I was given a king dexlue with one bed for the 3 or us. They refused to upgrade my room and wanted me to pay an additional $45 for a trundle. I refused when I had already paid an extra $366 aus for the room. I then was on the phone to my flight agent till midnight sorting out the issue. They managed to pay the hotel for the trundle but had at one stage wanted me to pay it and be refunded at the end. I told my agent an outright no as I don’t trust them after they also made us pay the destination fee again per night which was already paid for Clean rooms and fantastic location. No room service, but can easily go to Grand Central for a quick bite. Staff is very helpful. Breakfast buffet was very good; price was in line with other hotels of sinilar level.  Average but the destination fee is a scam. Everything is average, hotel, cleanliness, furniture but the worst part is on how they rob you with the so call 'destination fee' And you know what at check in they pretend it's a tax. So foreign might think it's a city tax or something similar. But it's not, they charge $39.99+tax DAILY for service you don't need. Like high speed internet, no need I have data plan. Discounts that aren't good and no need I have nyc city pass. And $15 credit daily on your room for the market. Come on I paid 39.90 for that, takes a gun and a mask to more robber than that. Of course Opodo, booking, Expedia don't inform you about this extra to pay \"},\n",

Overall every staff member I encountered was friendly and helpful- you can tell that they are all working very hard to give us a fabulous experience. Thank you for a wonderful stay. I stayed at the Moxy East Village as we moved our daughter to NYC over the New Years holiday. I’m a Hilton Diamond level member so I didn’t really want to try something new, but the Moxy came recommended by some friends and it did not disappoint!  We had two rooms as a family of four, and at every single interaction over five days  - the people were just wonderful ! Coming off a a red eye flight from Honolulu, the Moxy staff were generous with  letting us check in when a room was available. They helped us find places to get supplies for my daughter’s dorm (1 block away), and we were greeted every time we returned for the night.  I’m going back this week & I will likely spend the next four years at the Moxy as a great place to stay and visit my daughter while she is  at NYU. This is the perfect hotel for families! The bunk rooms are brilliant and although small (like every hotel room in NYC) the space is well thought out. Our teenagers appreciated not having to share a bed with anyone!  The location was perfect with easy access to the subway. The staff were very helpful and helped us plan out parking in advance, which made for a stress-free arrival.  I would absolutely stay at this hotel again! Carmen and Andrew were absolutely phenomenal and kind. Great experience checking in with them. They went out of their way to accommodate me to the best of their ability and gave great recommendations for food nearby. Would certainly stay here again. One of the best experiences my partner and I have had at a hotel. I wanted to start wedding year off right with a little staycation so I booked one night at their location. We were greeted in the lobby by Nikki who was so personable. We probably chatted with her longer than we should’ve because she was just so warm and kind. Thank you Nikki!   One of the managers Maria had booked out stay and you can tell she went above and beyond because as soon as we walked in to our room we were greeted with messages on our mirror congratulating us and balloons! It was such a nice touch. At the end of the stay she gave us some moxy swag to take home too! Forever grateful for such an amazing experience. We definitely will stay there again and are thinking about having our out of town guests I regularly stay at the Moxy NYC East Village. I very much enjoy the vibe. Everyone is pleasant and courteous. I particularly enjoy the reading room and  Cafe d' Avignon. The staff there is very nice and accommodating, particularly Conny, Yesenia and Natanael. Their smiles and good cheer help me start my day on a very positive note. I look forward to returning to the Moxy every time I'm in the City. Bed is comfortable, I would say the room is small but the rest of the amenities make up for it. The coffee shop and bar are great hang outs. Most importantly, the tenders are extremely kind and friendly - special thanks to Yesenia, Conny, Romanio, and all the tenders whose name I did not get the chance to know. Paris, the head of security, was awesome. Super friendly and extremely helpful. He helped me retrieve a wallet from the lost and found and I was relieved since I had come in the past but couldn’t find it myself. Top notch service from this gentleman!  The process was very smooth, everything ckean and exactly as described.  Maria at the front desk was amazing, very professional and her energy was just uplifting! I would sefinitely recommend this place if traveling with family, for bussiness or just to relax. Lovely hotel with all location walkable from it.  The Moxy has a great vibe and interesting decor.  The staff here are great and really helpful. There’s loads of nice restaurants attached to it, so if you don’t want to go far in the evening it’s great. Thanks Conny, Romario, Nathanael and team for your excellent service and hospitality. Everyday started with a smile, having breakfast in your coffeeshop. We really enjoyed our stay in New York at the Moxy East Village Hotel. Next time we’re in NY, we will visit you again👍 The coffeeshop in The Moxy East Village is a perfect place to get a good cup of coffee, a nice sandwich and tasteful desert. Service is great and atmosphere is  really nice. So if you’re staying at The Moxy, don’t forget to get your coffee in the hotel. Stayed at the Moxy hotel and went to the Alphabet cafe every morning. The crew there Conny, Romario, and Nathanael were super friendly and worked as if there was espresso coursing through their veins. Polite and friendly is just the way everyone should start their days. Not to mention, the food and coffee was on point! The pastries weee fresh and moist with flavor. This spot is a must visit, even if you aren’t staying in the hotel. They have a welcoming and cozy lounge area as well, where you can even borrow a book to enjoy. Thank you for the wonderful service crew!  When traveling, accommodation is everything. Being right at the start of the new year, I wasn’t fully prepared for my last minute business trip. Walking into this Moxy, I was greeted with a warm welcome and a comforting staff.   Big shout out to Kevin who went above and beyond finding me an IPhone charger to keep my trip in track. We all know how important it can be to have a full charge at the start of the day.   Thanks again, would 100% recommend. I usually stay at the moxy at the East Village when coming for my staycations in NYC. The staff is nothing but helpful and lovely. However during this stay Paris went above and beyond for me when I needed a phone charger that I left in the car. He gave me his own from his office to borrow for the night and didn't make me walk all the way to the garage late at night in the cold. He was a true gentleman.  Connie, Nata,  Yesi Very friendly , excellent service They always greeted us with a smile and made our drinks just as we requested. Everything was always clean and had many choices of pastries to choose from . We will be returning to this hotel and will let our friends and family know about it Ok Place, kind of fancy, but nothing special about this place. Staff obviously doesn’t like it’s job too much and rooms are very small even for NYC. Definetly not ok is charging guests 8 bucks for a cup of coffee and noise level from bar or club until 3am Hotel was super nice and comfy, and Paris (security) made us a huge favour of looking out for our stuff without asking anything in return! Appreciated! We will return for sure!  Central location, metro and bus nearby. Beautiful room and wonderful atmosphere in the entire hotel. All the staff were friendly and helpful (especially Nikki during check-in and throughout our stay). Also very clean and tidy, with housekeeping coming every day. What a gem!!  This hotel may be the best Marriott property in NYC. The rooms were efficient but well appointed and the shower water pressure was like no other. For a family that wakes at different times having a quality cafe on premises was perfect. Staff was very kind and attentive. Well done! Oshyn and Siarra are incredible and definitely made me decide to rebook at this hotel for my future visits. They were extremely kind and helpful. They had great local recommendations and made me feel very welcomed for my stay. Will definitely be staying at the moxy again! If I could give 6 stars I would. Great quality accommodation, great staff….particularly Siarra who was super helpful always!!   Cracking location without the Uptown crowds.   Subway options, excellent dining and shopping options around.  Had a great stay here. Rooms are small but cozy. The bar downstairs is a fantastic space to hang out in, it feels like an extended living room. The week I was there, they had a fantastic DJ and a terrific morning exercise class that really added to my stay. Staff was friendly and helpful across the board, and it's a great location between the East Village & Union Square. Would definitely stay here again! Really fun hotel, well-designed and well-run by very pleasant people. There were 6 of us coming to NYC for a concert given near Union Square, and the hotel location was perfect.   We had planned to have wine and appetizers at the hotel - the oysters grabbed us - before the concert but when we arrived we discovered that the hotel dining venues had all been taken over for a private party.   We asked about possible nearby places, explaining our time constraints and what we wanted, and the receptionists sprang into action.   They arranged for us to go around the corner (to Tiger Lilly, a nice experience also) at the Moxy's expense!   We did so and enjoyed it thoroughly. We found the rooms to be efficient, though we had a bit of trouble with the blinds.   The beds were comfortable, Carmen and team were very accommodating hosts . From understanding my needs to giving great service with a smile, I felt very welcomed at the Moxy east village . Great location and concierge recommendations as well.  This was our 2nd stay at the Moxy East Village and we can’t wait to visit again. We come from New Jersey and love to spend a few days in the city. Perfect location for the village, soho, little Italy, movies and local theater. We love the rooms and especially the common areas. Especially love the friendly and welcoming staff. Thank you Mac and Nikki!!!! Great stay. Had to manage some deliveries to the hotel and when one got sent to the wrong location, Paris on staff was extremely helpful! He went above and beyond to help get those deliveries to an event. Very hard worker, polite, and patient.  I travel to the City quarterly for work and have been staying near Times Square but wanted to try a different area and found this hotel. Amazing stay, great location near Union Square and awesome staff - special shout out to Nikki who helped us check in smoothly and realize our $30 credit. Will def be staying again! Not only was the room wonderful and welcoming but so were the desk workers! They were very generous and let us check in early! I couldn’t be more grateful. The room was luxurious and I loved the stay. Definitely coming again. It was a joy to have breakfast every morning and be greeted by Conny, Romario, and Nathanael. They were joyful and efficient. The food is excellent and it was a perfect space to have a meeting. My room was spotless and comfortable. I would stay here again. Came here on business with some friends/colleagues for a film festival. It's getting 4 stars from me for how pricey it was and how small the room was (but also that's New York so what else is new). The lounge was pricey but great, they had a great cafe/studying section. The decor was cool, they gave us a $30 food voucher every day for the room. The restaurants wouldn't pick up their phones for reservations which was annoying. Overall, not bad at all! ABSOLUTELY LOVELY CUSTOMER SERVICE! Siarra at the front desk was INCREDIBLY helpful throughout my whole stay!!!! 11/10! There was a smoking situation on our floor, night and day staff handled it beautifully.  I had an issue with my reservation and they solved quickly. The attention was really nice and I am very happy to have chosen this hotel to visit New York. I highly recommend it. Also the hotel is nice, and the neighbourhood is chill. I'm so obsessed with My Moxy!!! , I am  the Moxy Diva!!!! I absolutely love, Moxy East Village, I am already booked for Spring, I love the energy, the professionalism, I'm over obsessed with the rooms,My Absolute Favorites are; Ashley, Cristian, Carmen, and Oshyn! They are amazing, Give them a Raise❤️✨️ I checked in to the hotel on a busy Saturday evening. Nothing was really explained to me about the check in process or hotel. They were taking more money as a security deposit but didn't explain any of this. My Mother checked in a day after me and was offered no help and nothing was explained to her either. She was also made to wait a long time and no assistance with her luggage was offered either. Also they appear to have things like yoga classes and other bars but because none of this is explained we didn't ever check them out until the last day when another customer mentioned it.   The rooms were clean and well looked after but the staff on reception is a real mix. The lady working in the morning is great but the rest of the team is not. My Mother who is mid-sixties was badly Maria and Baz!!! I got to experience Maria’s bubbly (? Maybe just awesome) personality today. She whispered that Baz was really the man. Yeah- he’s pretty great! I’m watching Netflix with my Prince Street Pizza with my COLD Fiji water (thanks Baz for the ice)…  I’ve been here for less than 12 hours and you two have made it awesome in just that one interaction. I hope to see you both manana. Clean, fun, and efficient rooms. Super comfortable bed. Croissants in the cafe were delicious too. Staff were helpful and friendly… Nikki checked us out. Didn’t get makes on the evening staff when we checked in, but they were great, too. Highly recommend this hotel! Had the most incredible stay at Moxy. Everything from the location to the service was perfect. HUGE shout out to Alex for being so friendly, funny, and giving the BEST recommendations that made our trip so memorable. We can't wait to visit again!  Very nice boutique hotel. Well appointed with trendy bar, cafe and sitting/socialising area. East Village is a good location to stay when in Manhattan. Nikki on the front counter was awesome and very welcoming. Thanks for a great time and your hospitality.\"},\n",

I only with the rooftop bar would remain open later on weekends so we could stop in for a cocktail after our theater or musical event. The Knick is completely renovated, sleek and modern. We were expecting more of a vintage style hotel (I guess we didn't check out the photos) and it is anything but. Our room was surprisingly large. We loved the bathroom with double sinks, and separate toilet and shower space.   The location is great- right on Times Square but, more importantly, right next to the subway.  The roof top bar is lovely with a great little bar menu. The buffet breakfast was exceptional.   We loved everything about this hotel. and would stay here again in a NY minute.  This was my second stay at the Knickerbocker in New York City and I’m sure I will be back in the future. The rooms are big, beds are comfortable, and the location is ideal. I would have liked breakfast to be included. The bed and the pillows were very comfortable.  The toiletries smelled lovely. The cleaning service did a wonderful job.  The welcoming staff were very friendly and helpful.  The restaurant was beautiful and the food was excellent. The room size is good. It is clean. Front desk is happy and nice. It is at times square near to my office. I enjoyed $50 credit for a nice breakfast at their cafe. I will go there again if I traveled to New York for work We had a wonderful  second stay at the Knickerbocker Hotel this weekend!  The beautiful, clean accommodations set in an ideal location in Manhattan make it our go to hotel in NYC. The staff is welcoming, extremely courteous, professional, and accommodating. We look forward to our next visit back to the Knickerbocker. Great service and the place was beautiful! It was very clean and the room was spacious and a great view too. I would definitely come back when I’m in New York. It definitely gives luxury status!! I didn’t try the restaurant fully but the breakfast was delicious. Beautiful hotel in a great location. Wonderful staff.  This was our second NYE at this location, but have also stayed there numerous times throughout the year. Can be a little but worth it. Room service is very limited,  but Charlie Palmers is very good. The rooftop is amazing. Location is convenient to most attractions. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel and rooms are modern and new it also smells delightful. Interesting that there was no tea &coffee facilities or glasses however the staff were great when this was requested. Great location and would recommend to others I stayed here for a couple of days and it was fantastic. They offered a complimentary gift basket and were really quick when we needed something. I really recommend this hotel, it is the best I have ever been to and I am a frequent traveler. The rooms were lovely, clean, comfortable and well furnished. The hotel is perfectly located in Times Square and close to everything with the subway almost next door. Staff were very helpful. The rooftop terrace is lovely for a drink at night. You would never know you were in the middle of NYC up there! The only thing I would change is providing coffee and tea facilities in the room as that would make a big difference in the mornings. Other than that I can’t fault it and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting NYC.  We are just regular people, this was a very expensive place for us! But when on vacation we like to splurge! That being said at first I felt outta place but they treated us just the same when we showed up in sweat pants and hoodies! lol great place great location! Absolutely loved everything about our stay and how friendly the staff were. We especially loved the local directions from the concierge, Denise. She was very informative and nice to our kiddos.  We loved the location, not a fan of the car horns as wake-up calls, but we loved the ease of getting to other attractions from there.  We stayed here for Christmas for 2 nights. The customer service and all the staff were so polite and helpful. The rooms were beautiful, the valet parking was perfect, the rooftop bar was awesome. Drinks were absolutely delicious. My family will return to this hotel next time we stay in the Times Square area and recommend it to anyone else who is considering it. Amazing NYE party and staff!  I would highly recommend a stay there! Everyone was so accommodating and the location was superb! I hope to return again! Thank you to everyone there for their kindness, smiles and putting me in a NY state of mind! The Staff could not have been more helpful, accommodating, friendly and hospitable!  The hotel is beautiful and conveniently located ~ the staff really made it special!  We were there for NYE with children and they made sure we were well taken care of, knew what to do and where to go and how to have a great experience! This was one of the best hotel experiences we have had. First hotel is awesome. Historic hotel with updated rooms and amenities. Restaurant was fantastic and great with the kids. Rooftop bar was also great with top notch bartenders and great outside patio. Rooms were updated and modern meeting. Blackout shades and very comfy bed and pillows. We upgraded to jr suite and was more than enough room for family of five. Concierge team was great before we arrive and made dinner and limo reservations for us. Made our kids feel as stars upon arrival. Jimmy was an already a great representative for the lobby. Helped us with our bags and welcomed us each time when we come back to the hotel. He was one of the greatest parts of our visit and made us feel very welcome as guests. This was a Excellent stay and location. If you get this hotel for a reasonable price then please do book them if visiting Times Square. Worth the penny. Just 200 mts to the Times. Would recommend for all type of people.  This is by far my favorite hotel in NYC. It's a great location and the rooms are fantastic. On top of the convenience to everything, the entire staff of the hotel always goes above and beyond to make sure we have a great stay. On our most recent stay, we were assisted by Victor, who helped us during check in, check out and the duration of our stay. We're definitely coming back! We enjoyed our stay but we didn’t expect the extra cost per day. Being Australian we weren’t aware of this until paying when checking out. Location, staff and cleanliness of the room were great. The food from the restaurant was yummy and catered for a celiac. I stayed at The Knickerbocker on Christmas, and it was the perfect Christmas ever, I am glad I chose The Knickerbocker to stay for our Christmas. The room condition is really good, and the staff was VERY kind and excellent. Highly Recommended! We had a wonderful festive stay at The Knick. Staff could not have been more welcoming and helpful and they made Christmas extra special for our children. This hotel is a classy gem in a perfect location with first class food and cocktails. Beautiful property i. The heart of NYC/Times Square, great location to get around to all the sites, super comfortable beds, great food, excellent service all around, we had zero issues during our stay…I will definitely return!  Amazing staff and amazing rooms and amenities. I had a nice experience from the moment I walked into the door to the moment I exited the door to go back home. I would consider going back again if I ever return to NYC This place was nothing short of amazing! The venue is completely beautiful and the service is so awesome!! I would absolutely recommend checking this hotel and rooftop out any time visiting New York or exploring the city! Johir is the main man. This guy gave TOP SERVICE!!! This was my first experience here for NYE and he was the best! He helped everyone with our dietary restrictions. 5/5 Also, this time is the best I def recommend it  Johir is amazing!!! Made our night amazing!!! Everything was absolutely spectacular!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So kind so attentive and helpful could not have asked for a better server. Thank you so much for the Knickerbocker for this is experience  and please give him a raise. We had a fantastic stay at the Knickerbocker Christmas week…the hotel is fabulous, the staff fantastic!  Shout out especially to Jimmy and Diane who were so helpful as I showed my 4 grandchildren NYC at Christmas for the 1st time! Great location and the staff are very polite and attentive. We had no issues and would definitely stay again.   Close to Bryant park, Times Square and subway. Easy walk to Radio City Music Hall and Broadway.  Great staff, great room, good food. Stay here every year or two and never  disappointed. Part of Leading Hotels of the World, so we get points and free breakfasts. Location is only drawback. Times Square sucks.  The hotel was awesome!! Big room, exceptionally clean.. they cleaned every day brought clean towels and water bottles daily.. the breakfast was good but ridiculous we had the buffet one plate it was 114.00 for 2  Very clean, comfortable and customer service friendly.   The hotel has a very relaxed atmosphere amid all the hustle and bustle of the city which was wonderful.   The location was perfect and the rooms were modern and clean.  We enjoyed the rooftop lounge, it was perfect to relax with a drink and take in the city lights.  Will stay again. We made our room reservations well in advance and confirmed them twice. When we arrived they had trouble finding our reservation and when they did, they realized they had given away the room we booked so they put us in a smaller, inferior room. The room had one small window that faced a building that was only a few feet away, this blocked the sunlight and caused a dark gloomy, depressing room. We called it the dungeon.  At check in, I asked to speak to one of the managers and the clerk assured me they would reach out to me and make things right, but they never did.  After 2 nights, I received one of those automated texts asking how our stay was going.  When I responded, we had some issues they texted back concerned, but at that point it was too little, too late.  When looking We had a great stay at the knickerbocker, fantastic location, central to everything. Rooms were nice, clean, great amenities. We found all of the staff super friendly except the staff at the rooftop bar, unenthusiastic, rude, overcharged us a couple of times  The staff is amazing, very attentive and efficient. They made you feel welcome and went above and beyond to make sure everything went as smoothly as possible. Clean hotel, comfy beds and pillows. Rooftop bar was nice and drinks were great! I will definitely be back  Overall this is a decent hotel in NYC and the location is great for sightseeing. The hotel is in the ‘Leading Hotels of the World’ group and markets itself as the only 5* hotel in Times Square - This is NOT a 5* standard hotel.   Pros - * Location, perfect for sightseeing  * Housekeeping, the room was always immaculate on our return. * Room sizes, larger than the average NYC hotel. * Noise levels were so low considering the chaos outside.  Cons - * Tired decor in room, carpet frayed at the edges and stained with what looked like make-up. The dressing gowns provided had seen better days and were not wearable. * the rooftop bar, you’ll be lucky to get in as it’s always used for ‘private events’ seemingly at peak times, this was annoying. * No personal touch - because of the way What an amazing experience we had. The location of the building is perfect with subway access right next to the hotel and with a great view to the Times Square from the rooftop.The bedrooms were conmfortable although the cleaning that wasn’t that perfect. Beside this, the breakfast was good with great food but it was’nt much diverse.  In summary it was a perfect New York City experience to have with your family. Totally recomend. Our experience was disappointing, and that the air-conditioning didn’t work in both rooms that we had.  Along with that the TV didn’t work and we had four or five different folks come up and try to fix it. The door on the refrigerator was broken off. Unfortunately, it did not appear that the hotel has kept up with other top-tier hotels. This was a Christmas vacation That we were excited about that did not live up to expectations. By the way, when we called to have the TV fixed, it went to voicemail and we needed to leave a message. We had such a wonderful time.  The Knickerbocker was  amazing.  It was the perfect location to everything!  Walking distance to Bryant Park, Grand Central station, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Rockefeller Center,  Empire State building and Joe's Pizza and of course everting you can find in the Times Square.  The Hôtel was clean and the staff was super friendly.  The views from the roof top bar were spectacular.  I highly recommend The Knickerbocker.   Great hotel and best stuff ever ,  the location is amazing, everywhere is just steps away . This was my second visit to NEW YORK, I didn’t think twice to go and book at this hotel again. Hotel is very comfy and quiet, rooms are amazing , I travelled with my kids , and we got both rooms connected with corridor entrance.  Kids like the rooms facilities .  Thank you \"},\n",

My parents stayed at the Hotel Edison in 1951 on their honeymoon and came back to celebrate their 70th anniversary . They were treated like roylaty by the entire staff and i can not say enought wonderful things about the hotel and the staff . The customer service can not be beat and the staff can not do enough for their guests . The hotel is very old time elegant and the rooms are nice and clean and Covid safe. They upgraded my mom and dad to a suite which was lovely adn due to their age they had a walk in shower , which was very thoughful. Security is tight , you can not get up to the rooms withought a key car , which you also need for the elevator . My parents raved about the staff and the service that they received . The Edison had a team meeting before my parents arrival to Roomy , pleasant, well stocked with towels, water, coffee maker, sugar, coffee, creamer, soap, shower gel etc. Hair dryer, iron, safe, ironing board. Well placed. Helpful, friendly staff. Baggage hold for a dollar a bag for 24 hours. Felt secure as every person was checked prior to using lifts. Great breakfast every morning.  Could\\'ve done with a little better shower pressure and maybe a blanket available in the colder months, we woke up cold in the night a couple of times. But otherwise a  brilliant stay. Would definitely come back and would recommend to others. Thank you 😊 $792.98 for one night and no hot water! Three email requests for price consideration with no response. This is not the customer service that should be expected. Afternoon show time precluded checking in at 3:00. Room down grade with no rate change was accepted, but this price and no hot water is not acceptable. the connecting Family rooms were perfect for group.   He had one room with a King and one room with 2 queens, each with their own bathroom.  We did not feel cramped at all.  The location is excellent 4 times square and Broadway shows.  We used a sound machine at night to block out outside noises and slept great.  All of the staff were friendly.  The included breakfast was such a great perk. The rooms were clean and ours was recently renovated. Only small issue was poor wifi and a couple issues with the room door key but that did not effect our trip much. I would definitely return.  The first set of rooms had no water in one, and brown water in the other. The second set of rooms were better, but the air conditioner barely worked in one, and didn\\'t work in the other so the temperature never got below 78°. We had a great time at Hotel Edison. Service was great, the room was nice. The windows on the upper levels don’t open. Complimentary breakfast means Grab & Go but that’s alright. Restaurants and Bars are awesome. The location is fantastic.  They have pretty good entertainment right there in the hotel around supper time, which makes it fun.  Everything is in good condition. Minor hassles with location of electrical outlets in the room, and hiccups with the check-in kiosk.  I would probably stay there again. I would request a different room. They are working on upgrading their hotel, so it may be better in the future.  They were also working on the lobby area. Hotel location was amazing. I realize it is a very old hotel, but a little more detail cleaning the rooms would be good.  Stayed at Hotel Edison for a week. The location cannot be beat. Rooms are a little small, but very manageable. Beds are comfy. Housekeeping was wonderful! Beds are comfy. Besides a/c troubles, I’d definitely recommend.  This was an amazing experience in NYC on time square. The hotel had so much to offer and I will definitely return! The rooms very very clean and a great size compared to others near by. The Rum House offered great entertainment and bond 45 and friedmans offered great food!! The heater in our room was so noisey with banging pipes and general noise we couldn’t use it over night. The other room we had was fine.  Also the shower took 10 minutes to get hot but again the other room was fine. The reception said it’s the end room and nothing we can do. Poor Location is perfect, staff are brilliant. Really great food in Bond 45 as well. Budget hotel in a great location The Hotel Edison is the best hotel in Times Square and it is all due to the staff. The Edison is a historical hotel, it is affordable, and it could not be situated in a more convenient part of Times Square. It has been redone and is clean with comfortable beds and pillows.  All that being said, the best part about the hotel are the staff. From the bellmen who help you with your luggage to the front desk staff and the cleaning staff.  The one person who made our trip was Mr. Fehat Begolli. He and Gio showed us a level of care and kindness that truly made our NYC adventure. I was there with my family and everyone felt well taken care of. We have stayed here many times before and we will stay here again whenever we are visiting NYC. Thank you Fehat and thank you Hotel Edison! I always get great service at the Edison. Jennifer at the front desk is awesome. Convenient location; beautiful art deco design. Great restaurant and bar with good live music every night and great bartenders. Enjoyed our break in New York  Hotel was great  Good location  Excellent staff Clean welcoming room  Not overly impressed with grab and go breakfast and no where to sit and eat in hotel ended up going back to our room to eat our breakfast  This is THE hotel to stay at in NYC if you are visiting for a Theater visit. We saw 6 shows in 5 days a the longest walk to a theater was 8 minutes. The desk staff and housekeeping were very accommodating and helpful. The concierge was VERY friendly and helped us with dining options, walking directions and was generally a pleasant person to talk to. Very close to tons of dining options and very easy access to a number of subway stations. Hotel Edison contributes to a great experience in Times Square. The hotel is on the affordable side, so the amenities were not necessarily a \\'wow\\' factor, but the staff is very hospitable. Our room was prepared for us well and tidied up well during our stay. The Grab & Go breakfast is a great option to bundle with the room!  Room changes and construction were a problem.  I really should be comped the first night of our stay as we were relocated to the 12th floor where we were the only occupied room. The room was very shabby and we had bugs in the bathroom. Our stay at the Edison hotel was perfect!  We were able to check our bags when we arrived in NYC so we didn\\'t have to lug them around all day until check in.  It was only $1 a bag which is a bargain in NYC. The hotel was clean and comfortable and we had an awesome view of The Barrymore Theatre.  The location was excellent as we spent the weekend seeing shows.  Check out was easy and we were able to use the lobby when we needed a break from the weather.  I would recommend this hotel highly. Chose to stay here again after an enjoyable time last year. On check in, I asked as a returning customer  if we could have a high room with a nice view like last time and was told I had booked a classic room but she said she would we what she could do. she said I have upgraded you from a queen bed to a king. When we got to the room number 533, there was no nice view, only overlooking apartments. The room was very dim with only lamps and was in need of renovation. On our way out we went to reception to ask if we could have a kettle and I jokingly said could we have some candles in which she said  they did not have any. On our return, we found a kettle and another lamp in the room which was nice. Bed and pillows were very comfortable. The security is great as you cannot get to Amazing hotel amazing location and above amazing service . I had a great time at this establishment 30 second walk to time square and in the middle of everything and walking distance to everything you need to see in New York . Restaurant was great and breakfast as well , Thank you so much for my great stay at your hotel Noisy room, rude staff, hidden charges. Good location so close to Time Square and other tourist spots, accessible to subway stations. Room was ok except for the noises that you can hear from other rooms and outside the building.  Disgusted by our stay here. I have a picture of the toilet… front desk took my cell phone to show manager behind a closed door for minutes without even asking. Then manager came out and had zero customer service skills and said it was not there when we entered the room (implying we did it) and then looked at my kids and said… it could have been them!! Never ever again. Central location, friendly staff, clean, comfortable, free wifi, and breakfast included? In a city with so many options, Hotel Edison is a real find. We will definitely try to stay here next time we visit NYC! Amazing amazing amazing , the hotel is right in the heart of Time Square . We loved every moment of our stay , walked right out of our hotel and in the heart of everything . 30 second walk into the middle of time square , valet was perfect room was great and location just WOW  Perfect location, wonderful staff, Included breakfast options are a nice plus.   Only drawback is a tiny bathroom.  There is a lot of construction in the area but that is city-wide and cannot be avoided.   Fantastic location to Broadway and Times Sqaure. The parking is across the street which is full of restaurants. Some of which are connected to the Hotel. The staff is amazing. We had a small issue with our room and it was resolved immediately. The rooms were clean and updated. Also quiter than I expected for a busy hotel in the city. Great experience and would definitely recommend to others. We will be staying there again. If you want location then this is your Hotel. But that\\'s all you\\'ll get. Our room was dark and had a weird smell for whole 9 days.  Heating was super loud and even when turned off would turn on randomly through the night.  Windows have gaps in the seal which let in noise and freezing cold air all night.  All these reasons made sleep a nightmare and basically spent 9 days as a walking sleepless zombie. Location was perfect for us but would not stay at this Hotel again. Way too many negatives.  Location of the hotel is exactly what we were looking for. Room are very nice and incredibly quiet despite location. The only drawback of the hotel is its breakfast. It was announced as included but we had to pay additional 7$/person to be able to eat seated. It is not a buffet and doesn’t fill your stomach. It has deeply decreased our customer experience and unfortunately it will be the thing we will remember of this hotel Was very excited to arrive at our hotel after a 8 hour flight and 1.5 hour transfer, however was given one of the frostiest receptions I’ve ever had. It was like we were inconveniencing the staff by checking in. Was given our room key and directions to the elevators. There is a security guard on the entrance to the elevators who acts like an entitled nightclub doorman when you are transiting through. I understand the security element of non guests entering the hotel but mid afternoon I believe the intensity is not warranted. Upon arrival back to our room after a dinner out, our A/C was malfunctioning and making too much noise to allow us to sleep. I headed down to reception to report the issue but was met with attitude and eye rolling. “I’m not an engineer” was exclaimed to me Ideal location for theater attendees.  Leak near window/furnace made floor wet and prevented us from walking on that side of the room without shoes.  Furnace made loud clinking sound every couple seconds when heat was on. Prevented us from utilizing heat function during sleeping hours.  This was my fifth visit to the Hotel Edison, as it is my hotel of choice when making my annual winter voyage to see Broadway shows.  The location is exceptional.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  I appreciate the breakfast vouchers that are included as part of the nightly $40 fee, but I feel the charge is too high.  With regard to the breakfast options, the Bond 45 restaurant is clearly the best choice.  Both the \"grab and go\" breakfast and the sit down breakfast are exceptionally good. I had an unfortunate situation at Hotel Edison and I have spent over a year and a half simply trying to get a hold of someone to help me find resolution. I have sent several messages, letters and phone calls yet no one bothered to even acknowledge my concerns. I had really hoped to resolve this situation amicably and professionally but instead they are forcing my hand to write this negative review and as reviews are important to this industry maybe one day they will read this note and might actually look at this opportunity to better their customer service and relations.  Simple communication goes a long way. I am a patient and reasonable person but I feel that my business was not at all valued and my concerns ignored.  I travel to NYC several times a year and send my clients, Hannel was the best concierge we could have asked for. He helped us out when we had issues with the kiosk, offered assistance for our bags, and ensured we had a convenient stay. Best hotel we have been to by far. Have stayed here a number of times due to the cleanliness of the hotel and the central location beside Times Square. Rooms are very clean and staff are very friendly especially Michelle (J) who was very helpful and gave us tips on where to go visit which was a nice touch.  Great localisation near Time Square. Great service (restaurants, valet parking service, reception, house keeping). Maybe the rooms should be more isolated from street noises, as there is activity outside all night long. The room was  bigger than i expected the only issue i had was there wasnt enough cupboard space for a family of 4 friendly staff hotel had everything we wanted and the grab and go breakfast was great location was great which was ideal.The location was great for us as we was right next to everything  Took a Christmas tour of NYC the week between Christmas and New Years to see a show and the Rockefeller Christmas tree. We stayed at the Hotel Edison, and could not have made a better choice. Our stay was fabulous! The rooms are very nicely appointed and the bed was extremely comfortable.  The staff is friendly and extremely professional.  Everyone we had contact with was amazing.  The rooms were clean and comfortable.  The shower was outstanding! We had lunch at Friedmans and the food was excellent. Also had breakfast at Bond 45 and again, everything was great. Food at both locations was fresh and prepared as requested. The wait staff at both restaurants was very attentive and good. If driving, i would highly recommend you use their valet parking service and book your staff The staff is wonderful. We loved our room. The location is fabulous. We were in the heart of the theater district and easy walking distance to Herald Square, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, and Hudson Yards. We enjoyed the several great restaurant choices within a block from the Edison. We easily parked in the parking garage across the street. We will be back! Although room was clean the bathroom sink was cracked, the bathroom vent was not working the wallpaper was broken and the window shades were not working properly. Will not stay again.

And I enjoyed the lobby bar for a quick breakfast. The Ace Hotel NYC ….. what comes to mind…. Clean-space- enjoyable- friendly front desk-non hassle-great bed- soft pillows- great water pressure- lovely bath products, I mean they really are stellar-safe hotel- ideal location- what’s not to love. The front desk is always happy to see you- love how I can control how bright the lights are in the room with them all on Dimmer Switches- you control the brightness- every room I’ve had I slept well and I’m a light sleeper and ask for a quite room. This is the hotel for a light sleeper. I look forward to my next business trip here. There is no question where I’m staying I’m staying here!!! My coworker loves to try out different places and complains why change a great thing I’ll stick with my Ace Hotel!!!!  On arrival at the hotel, we were made to feel extremely welcome.  Our late check in went seamlessly; just what you need after a long flight! We were situated on the 7th floor and had a view of the Empire State Building which was an added bonus.  I chose this hotel because of the room sizes and I wasn’t disappointed.  There was more than enough room for the four of us in our room: The room was spotlessly clean too.  The area the hotel is situated in is excellent and we always felt safe.  It is easy to walk to so many attractions and the subway is also close.  We couldn’t have been more happy.  Thank you to everyone at The Ace Hotel for making our stay so special. I wanted to thank the Ace Team for all the little details you considered that made my night at Ace unforgettable and so fun + enjoyable!  I toured a hospitality industry colleague - and she was blown away by the Loft Suite detailing: “they just get everything right!”  I was able to go seamlessly from coffee to cocktails in the lobby, and left my 24 year old nephew there to meet his crew for late night rumpus. Great Location! Cute and quaint.  The perfect stay for my daughter and I.  We were able to walk to everything we wanted to do in NYC. (Theater. shopping, sites, and restaurants). Our room was clean and extremely comfortable.  The lobby reminded me of a cozy speakeasy.  Our check in service from Freddy was superb! He made us feel so welcomed :) We will be staying here again! I had an amazing stay, great location, the room was super comfortable and cozy, awesome view of the Empire state building w/ an amenity meeting me at my room.  Julio greeted me at the door & helped with my luggage & Freddy, Michelle were wonderful @ the front desk & got me to the room that I desired! Will definitely stay again! Freddy at the front desk was so helpful & friendly! We were stranded in the city during the storms, & we were feeling lost & Freddy made us feel very welcome …  The lobby at the Ace is very beautiful- lovely lighting & lots of cozy places to sit … like an old fashioned library …  The rooms had less amenities than our beloved Ace DTLA, but we were glad for the feather pillows & other trappings of familiarity that we love about The Ace .. We had a perfect stay at the hotel.  Matt and Freddy in particular were super helpful.  The location is great, everything was within walking distance from shops, to restaurants, to landmarks and the subway. Our room was spacious by NY standards and it was cleaned every day, spotless! There was a cafe, juice bar and bagel bar with access  just off the lobby.  Would definitely recommend Ace Hotel!  I stay at the Ace Hotel in New York whenever I\\'m in town for business. Instead of gifts this year my wife and I decided to go to the city for a few days of art museums, the ballet, and some great food.  We stayed in one of the corner suites which is more like an apartment than a hotel room. Everything was great and I highly recommend trying out this hotel. The lobby has a vibe each night and a great bar and Stumptown coffee is ready to get you going in the morning.  The staff was great and they even left us a couple of drink vouchers. This hotel is beautiful! I stayed here for a few days while in town for business and it was super comfortable and has kind of an old New York feel. The staff were super friendly and made an effort to make me feel welcome which is not something that I’ve experienced at all of the hotels I’ve stayed here in the area. Will definitely be staying here again on my next trip. My mother is very particular, and every holiday season when she comes to visit the city the only thing more stressful than getting everything done at the end of the year is finding her a place to stay (my apt is not up to par…). I couldn’t be more relieved with the Ace!   While checking her in everyone was super courteous and kind, and the room was so clean - not a single comment from her (this a big deal)! It’s close enough to landmarks and walkable places, but not so busy and in the middle of all the noise.  100% recommend. The bar and staff are really fantastic! There is a great selection of drinks, and the staff is very eager to provide guidance. It has a gigantic lobby, and there are also very cool lounge chairs that are great to hang out and chill with friends in! Went here with friends to have drinks before the holidays and had a great experience. The drinks are always yum and the ambiance divine! Would Definitely recommend coming here for drinks with friends. Make sure to get there early to catch a spot on the couch!! During my recent stay, I was genuinely impressed with the overall experience. The team at the hotel went above and beyond to make my stay enjoyable. From the moment I checked in, their courtesy and attentiveness were evident. They were quick to address any queries or requests, creating a welcoming and accommodating atmosphere.  One aspect that truly stood out was the dedication of the cleaning staff. The room was consistently maintained at impeccable standards. It was evident that a meticulous approach was taken to ensure cleanliness and hygiene. I appreciated the attention to detail, and it significantly contributed to my overall satisfaction during the stay. I wouldn\\'t hesitate to recommend this establishment to others based on my positive experience. I was staying at the Ace Hotel by myself over Christmas, and really appreciated how welcoming everyone was. My family was in contact with Freddy at the front desk to secretly organise a christmas gift for me, and he couldn’t have been more helpful and kind. Wrapping the gift and the personalised note were so sweet, and I am so grateful that he went the extra mile to make my time so special. I would definitely stay again and really value how kind and courteous all of the staff were.  Ace is a great hotel, great staff especially Freddy. He took great care of us for our stay. Room was clean and a good size. It has everything you need. Close to Penn station, it’s a great spot especially to stay away from Times Square  Ace Hotel is in a very convenient area of Manhattan and rooms are large for NYC hotels. Staff are very friendly and helpful. They changed our rooms from the noisy 2nd floor to higher floors. Special thanks to Juan who was  helped us with the luggage and getting a ride to the airport. Will visit again. Visiting the city with my girlfriend for my birthday and decided to stay at Ace Hotel. Glad we did, had an easy and fast check thanks to Jesus. The room was clean and the location was perfect for everything we had plan during our stay. Amazing customer service!!! Jesus, Michelle and Freddy made my stay an unbelievable experience. The room was very clean and bed is extremely comfy. If you are visiting New York or just need a staycation, Ace hotel is the way to go  My trip can best be described in one word... Wow!   Fantastic location, amazing staff, and very trendy loft-style rooms. Like the Empire State Building (which happens to be a few blocks away), the Ace Hotel is at the top of its game. I travel to NYC frequently and was impressed by the elevated experience that the Ace Hotel curated. It is at the pinnacle of excellence, right on the intersection of where comfort meets luxury.   Pro tip: The \"Miss Me Yet\" rye and bourbon cocktail at the Lobby Bar is also a MUST! Needless to say the drink name is ironic because I already miss my exquisite experience at this world class property! During my recent stay, the standout feature was undoubtedly the hotel staff. Their genuine warmth and unwavering commitment to guest satisfaction created an atmosphere of genuine hospitality. From check-in to check-out, their attentive and friendly approach made a lasting impression, turning a good stay into a truly exceptional one. Kudos to the remarkable staff for making this experience memorable. Candidly, my recent stay surpassed expectations. The room was spotless, offering a refreshing sense of cleanliness. The staff\\'s genuine warmth and attentiveness were standout features, creating an inviting environment. Positioned in a prime location, it effortlessly combined comfort and convenience. This hotel has earned my enthusiastic recommendation for those seeking a delightful and hassle-free stay. As always-- the ACE delivered in spades. Fantastic location, spacious and comfortably eclectic room-- and an engaging staff that were the highlight of the experience. There was an aura of safety, security and privacy at the ACE during my stay which I greatly appreciated. Special thanks to Juan, Julio and Roy for the kind assistance-- hope to be back soon in 2024. By the way, the French Onion Soup at the Lobby Bar is a must. thanks to the stuff for making sure things went RT for my family and I, big shout out to Freddy, he went beyond duty to help us out. Front desk service was amazing and the hospitality was top tier. Great job The Ace Hotel New York offers a vibrant and trendy stay in the heart of the city. The industrial-chic decor, combined with attentive staff, creates a unique and inviting atmosphere. The rooms are well-designed with a mix of modern amenities and artistic touches. The on-site dining options and bar provide great culinary experiences. However, some guests may find the rooms a bit small. Overall, a stylish choice for those looking for a distinctive urban experience in New York City. Kodie is a great addition to the team, she was so helpful and made our stay extra special. My girlfriend and I had the best stay. We met up with other friend couples in NYC. The location is amazing and the staff were incredible. Big shout out to Kodie, she hooked us up with some great restaurants to go to. Will definitely be back! So happy that The Ace continues to be the hippest, friendliest and most welcoming hotel in NYC. I have stayed here three times already this year and looking forward to my upcoming stay over the Christmas holidays. The staff, many of whom have been there for a long time, are absolutely the best and always go out of their way to ensure an amazing guest experience for all. First and foremost, I rarely leave reviews. But I felt the service I received from Freddy deserved recognition. Upon leaving my room I placed the “not now” magnet on my door as I did not want service on my room. When I returned my room had been serviced and most of my personal items moved. I went to the front desk to discuss this issue, and this is where encountered my guy Freddy. Freddy was very understanding of the situation, assured me the hotel would provide the necessary support (investigating/checking cameras) if items were missing from the room, and made sure I felt the situation was being handled appropriately. He also phoned housekeeping, and discussed their side of the situation with me. Freddy was great to work with and has the guests best interest in mind! Highly Comfortable room that easily accommodated two guests — more spacious than other places I’ve stayed in NYC. Well appointed. Great staff. Convenient location. Good for business or personal travel. Would definitely stay here again on a future visit. The location of the hotel is very good/central. Close to Broadway, 5th Ave. etc. Walking distance to most things.  However, the hotel itself is overpriced for what it is. The rooms are dark, small. Electric window blinds that constantly break, the taps come off in your hand when turning them - it\\'s just and/or trying too hard to be retro/old style. It\\'s very dark, lighting is bad in the rooms. The beds are not comfortable. It\\'s just not a practical hotel - e.g. the TV is situated in the room, around the corner from the bed, so you can\\'t even lie in the bed to watch TV. No ice machine on any floor, you have to go downstairs. Nobody answers the phone at the frontdesk, or rarely does / long waiting time to get any pickup.  I will say the cleaning staff are prompt and do tidy the I enjoyed a truly phenomenal stay at The Ace. I hadn\\'t been for many years, and was so happy to be back. The location is excellent, very close to subway, bed was incredible, and even with a buzzy lobby vibe, my room was quiet. I actually felt restored after spending a night here which doesn\\'t typically happen in city-that-never-sleeps NYC. Great hotel, fantastic location for all the tourist sites in NYC ,  5 minutes walk from the Empire Sate building ,  25 mins from Central Park. Really good bar and adjacent restaurants. But stay in an upper floor room and try to be courtyard facing- we stayed one night on the 4th floor and it was really noisy from local builders / deliveries first thing. Saying that the staff we amazing, moved us right away with no fuss. I’m hooked!  From the incredibly friendly staff to the little room perks, the Ace Hotel in NYC is my new go to when I’m in town. The lobby vibe is something to be experienced. The transformation of the lobby to an eclectic people watching scene come evening time is a highlight.   Rooms were quiet and comfortable. The cute bath robes were a nice touch as well as the stocked fridge.   The front desk staff, especially Freddy, made sure I had everything I needed and then some. I look forward to getting back to NY soon! Loved this hotel! Perfect location! Perfect place if here for work or fun. Staff was great. Freddy at the front desk was especially wonderful and very helpful during our stay! Wish I could’ve stayed longer.  After the long flight from the west coast to JFK I cannot begin to sing enough positive praises of the warm welcome from Michelle at the front desk here at the Ace Hotel! In a world full of so much negative I applaud & will tell the hotel manager they must give Michelle a raise & make sure to show here this review! Thrilled to be staying here again & cannot wait to have my morning coffee in the super hip library-style lobby!  Stayed overnight with my family of four (two teen boys) in two rooms - one medium king, one with bunk beds.  We loved it!  Cool, stylish boutique hotel.  Warm, welcoming staff.  Rooms well-appointed with vintage fridges, turntables.  Eclectic range of art - there is something to look at or read everywhere - so many hidden gems on the walls.    Centrally located but also hidden and quiet.  Can get to any other neighborhood easily and within walking distance of Penn Station and Grand Central Station. I had a wonderful stay at the Ace in November 2023. It\\'s always my hotel of choice when I travel to NYC, but this visit was particularly special. My room was so comfortable and the bed was fabulously cozy, with really good pillows and soft sheets. The bathroom had all the amenities, and of course everything was super clean and well appointed.  Also they even left me a coupon for a complimentary drink at the bar, which was thoroughly enjoyed. I also loved that they had the radio on with music playing when I arrived to my room. It just added to a feeling of being welcomed, like I was coming home. Such a nice touch!  I particularly appreciated the warm and authentically friendly service at the front desk. I was greeted immediately upon entering with smiles and offers of assistance. I stay at the Ace every other month when I go to New York for work and I love it.  It is in a great neighborhood, surrounded by great places to eat and ease to get all over the city by subway.  The staff is awesome and the rooms are clean and quiet.   As always, no mistakes here. The room carries all you needs The lobby makes you liveable and young The location is perfect to go anywhere in the city. The staff is always helpful and friendly, especially my man Freddy  Ace Hotel New York - Excellent service ., Fantastic location , Functional and a lack of insulation on the windows and thin walls .The decor is funky rooms. Up graded rooms and original artwork , fridges and turntables. The rooms are fully air conditioned. Fully accomodating staff. Neat and clean sorroundings. Very fresh and classic. And also the restaurant  is so accessible and presentable.'},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': \"Beautiful Hotel, staff is very accommodating, prime location, clean rooms, great security. We can't wait to come back in the Fall. We spent only 2 nights before leaving this time. Easy access to trains, shops, landmarks and restaurants. Glad we stayed here. I will not visit this property again.  The room couldn't be any smaller.  The hallways are dark and dirty with carpet taped together.  Prior to arrival I had the option to pay an additional fee for a room upgrade (slightly larger with a city view).  My view was of an alley and the room was much smaller than the pictures online.  The front desk was not helpful in resolving this issue.  The location was good (close to MSG and Penn Station), but not worth the stay at this property.   The location was great, the neighborhood was nice and lively, the hotel was only a few minute walk to the train station.  There is a subway stop right at the same corner as the hotel.  Their Tick Tock restaurant was more than adequate (hash browns were not the best tho).  The $5 bag hold service was super useful to keep my suitcase the day I checked out, while I enjoyed the city. The location was amazing. We exited Penn Station and were looking right at the hotel. It couldn’t have been easier or more convenient. We were early for check-in, but we were allowed to check in anyway. The staff was super friendly and upgraded our room (it was my birthday). The rooms are a bit dated, but immaculately clean and very comfortable. The view was outstanding. We loved security being at the elevators checking key cards. It made us feel very safe and secure. The Tick Tock diner in the lobby was awesome for breakfast or a snack at the end of the day (try the Nutella and banana French toast; your taste buds will thank you). The bag check service was super affordable ($5/bag) and allowed us to spend our last few hours in the city (after checkout time) without our heavy We spent a significant amount of time dealing with reception staff over a mixup in our reservations and billing. This took up a significant amount of our time and impacted our overall satisfaction with our stay. Upgrades were offered but unavailable, and alternatives were also offered but then unavailable.  Beds were confortable but very small for 2 adults - doubles only - which impacted on sleep. Some rooms were very noisy - we had one near elevators which made noise all day/nigjt. Also, hotel run down and needs some maintenance doing - walls painted, carpet replaced etc. Secuiety excellent and cleaning staff very helpful. Not great value for maney as we paid $14,000 AUD  over Christmas/New Years  for 10 nights , so with this level of fee would expect hotel to be up to date This is our 4th stay at The New Yorker. From the moment the courteous doorman welcomes you, to the minute you step into the lobby, you are transported back in time. We love the vibe and layout.  The front desk employees are always professional, very pleasant and will help you with whatever you need.  Yes, the rooms are definitely small, but they are CLEAN!  The beds have always been comfortable.   We have never had one issue staying here. I feel safe having security in the lobby.  The bar is always a good time and I love the convenience of a diner inside the building. We stay here when we come to see Broadway Shows.  The location is convenient, and the rooms are reasonably priced. We'll be back for sure! Despite emailing the hotel several times since booking 6 months ago. We got no response and even the email address on wnydhams main website is invalid, for this hotel.  They were more interested charging us for early check in and to leave luggage and to upsell us to upgrade room.  Location is great though Great location. Very clean rooms. Great view. It is definitely a hotel that I will visit again. The personnel were very friendly and helpful, it was a real pleasure to be there. The bathroom was outdated but that just added some charm.  Beautiful nostalgic hotel!   We thoroughly enjoyed our stay during the holidays - the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The hotel staff was friendly and very helpful especially with food options!   Located within walking distance of lots of good shops/sites including Macy’s and Madison Square Gardens. Subway lines are very close by. Highly recommend this hotel!  Great location but that's where it ended.     We arrived later than expected due to our flight being cancelled and had to re-route to Barcelona and then onto New York, on arrival late in the night, reception proceeded to tell us that there was a problem with the room, believed there had been a leak (later told our agent they just gave our room away), so after 24 hours of travelling, our two bed family room wasn't availablle and they only had a box room with one bed and our son (15) had to sleep on the floor.  We were asked to vacate in the morning so as could find alternative room so couldn't unpack.  We were promised a refund of the room, which we only spent 7 hours in which the management later renegued on, the Guest Service Manager viewed after the event and we had left for This was my third stay at the New Yorker Hotel. It is centrally located and is in walking distance to Time Square, Broadway, Macy's, Bryant Park, Hudson Yards, Rockefeller Square, Empire State Building..... the list can go on. It is also right across the street from Penn Station which is great for getting to and from the airports and accessing the subway. I have always found all staff from front desk, housekeeping and security to be very friendly and approachable. They are quick to assist such as requesting a blanket, a room issue or information.  The hotel itself is quirky in areas of the room because they have kept true to the hotel's original architecture, room layout and size which is so much part of its charm. The hotel is very clean and well kept and some of the views are The New Yorker has been our go to hotel in New York for several years. Location is perfect for getting to from the train and an easy walk to anything we could want. Mohammad at the front desk made this trip extra special going out of his way to provided everything we asked for and more. We look forward to returning. The hotel is on the dated side but for what we paid for it we were happy enough. Rooms are small and basic but bed is comfy and shower pressure was great which is all we needed as we didn’t spend much time in room. The rooms are in definite need of an upgrade, however it’s your typical old New York hotel. Service from the reception was great. There is a CVS just across the road, completely ideal. Train and sub stations right next door. Would definitely stay again. For the money, the New Yorker is a great option in Midtown Manhattan.   We had four rooms and each one of them were different in terms of what had been renovated or updated, so be aware that the hotel is in the process of updating.  Every room was clean as a whistle and the cleaning staff were always super nice and helpful.     The staff are what make this hotel.  Everyone was super helpful and nice to deal with.  They all seemed to truly enjoy working at the New Yorker.  Ms Linda H checked us in and could not have been nicer.  She has been in hospitality for 32 years and it showed.  She embodied the positive attitude and friendliness that we received from all the staff.   From the doormen, the cleaning staff, or a random person in the hall, everyone wanted to make sure we were This hotel is a great disappointment.   The best thing about it is its location; as mentioned by many others, Penn Station is opposite and the subway from there goes all over the city.  The hotel claims to have undergone a programme of refurbishment. I was struggling to identify where. Our room (22nd floor) has not seen any refurbishment for some time and the bathroom was from a different era. It was also very small. The common parts too clearly need some attention.  The lobby of the hotel is small. It is always busy and there are few places to sit. There always seemed to be a queue of people waiting to check-in/check-out/speak to reception. The reception staff were not the most friendly nor helpful and the duty manager was downright rude: when I talked to her about those I The hotel is a piece of history.  We travelled with virgin and stayed here on the reps recommendation,  I’m glad we did.  The hotel has a grand feel and old world charm.  Check in was easy and the lovely reception lady up graded our double double standard to a room with a view and it was fantastic.  The rooms are small but it didn’t matter as we were only there for 5 days and there was only my son and myself.  The rooms are tired and dated and the carpets in rooms and halls need refreshing but the rooms, beds, and towels were spotless and cleaned daily.  My only real criticism is that the bathroom really smelled of sulphur and was really unpleasant on a morning but that maybe the drains?  To me this hotel was perfectly situated,  not too close to the madness of Times Square but The New Yorker boasts a fantastic location across the road from Penn Station and just minutes from Times Square and Macy's.  The hotel lobby is accessed via very grand revolving doors or extremely heavy doors which are near impossible if you have luggage and often there is no door person available so will depend on luck if there is assistance or not.  During this stay on numerous occasions there have been significant queues waiting for the front desk to check in and out, Although from my  experience the staff I dealt with were very friendly and welcoming.  Security do check room keys as you enter the Elevators and these are separated by express for higher floors and lower floors, although it's has not been unusual to have long waits at busier times, so allow plenty of time.  On Stay away if you don’t want to be humiliated by these goofy employees! They don’t know how to do their job and on top of that they’ll embarrass you in public around others! Simply because you ask something more than once or tell them it’s their mistake for mixing up 3 guest names about 3 times!!  We went for the Rocketts Christmas show , it was wonderful. Saw many other sites . My grandchildren had a ball. Lots to see, food was very good . I would recommend the New Yorker and stay again. Weather was mostly good .  We stayed here for 5 nights over Christmas, the hotel is in a brilliant location with penn street station right outside making it incredibly easy to get around. Close enough to Times Square to walk, but far enough away that the crowds aren’t so big, plenty of bars, stores and eateries around.  Rooms are a little dated, but they were clean, tidy and comfortable, exactly what you need for a stay in the city. Our 2 queen room was clean and comfortable. It was cleaned regularly and early in the day. The staff was friendly, helpful and efficient. The linens were sparkling white and the beds very comfortable. Great location, friendly and welcoming staff but bedrooms decor and facilities shabby and tired! Brown carpet, brown furniture, poorly insulated and heated room and just generally needs a good upgrade.  The location, price, room, restaurants and amenities were outstanding. I didn’t realize the history of the hotel until I was there - such a cool history. Also as a woman traveling alone the security process and presence was incredibly comforting.  I appreciate there were three restaurants to match the atmosphere I needed for that meal.   The only thing I could ask to improved (in general) would be more gluten free (or even gluten conscious) meal options and snacks - both in the restaurants and at the coffee cart. I can only eat so many salads in 3 days. The location was great. Having a restaurant to order food was great as well. We had a wonderful time. Rooms were ok for such a old hotel. The Comic Con was a bonus. We will stay there again. The pillows were soft. The bathroom needs updating.  Hotel Location is amazing! The hotel is historic, but still very beautiful!  The check-in experience was absolutely terrific! The gentleman who checked us in was so helpful and nice! Our room was not quite what we were expecting, so they switched us to a new room the next day, and it was absolutely wonderful! I can’t say enough of how nice everyone was at the New Yorker. I would definitely stay here again! Our new room was on the 29th floor and these were our amazing views! I highly recommend! This was our second stay at The New Yorker Hotel because our last visit was amazing. It is centrally located and a great value. We had a stunning view of The Empire State Building. I don’t think we will stay anywhere else.  Great hotel for a solo woman traveller. The facility is gracious, artistic, a lovely atmosphere all round. The rooms have old world charm and comfort. I always feel so safe and taken care of here at the New Yorker Hotel as the front doorman and elevator doorman look out for all the guests. Also, you have three dining options within the hotel; The Tick Tock Diner, The Butcher and Banker, and the Trattoria Bianca. All unique venues. This beautiful old hotel still values the lobby experience with comfy chairs and quiet corners to take a moment. The New Yorker still charms me every time I visit.  Very expensive cubicle! The bathrooms did not have a place to put my personal hygiene products; I had to use the top of the toilet seat. No refrigerator in the room. I could not control the room temperature, so the cold draft blowing in from the window made the room cold.  21st floor. The hotel is old and needs updating.  If you don't care about ambiance, this hotel is centered around the main attractions in Manhattan. The place is steeped in history! Iconic Hotel in NYC! Warm welcoming friendly efficient! I love this hotel and will always stay here when I’m in NYC! The exceptional one was Jonan! Upgraded me and made some great offers I could not refuse! He was very accommodating friendly and helpful a real asset to the business! I will definitely be back soon!!! Just recently visited New York and my 2nd time staying at the New Yorker. The hotel is lovely, our room was spotless and the staff were all very friendly. The location of the hotel is excellent with madison Square Gardens just across the road and times Square just up the street plus a 34th Penn st metro right across the road with access to uptown and downtown. I didn't take any pictures inside the room however here is one of the view we had looking onto The Empire State building. Ok good points first, the location.  Bad points. The hotel is very outdated. The rooms tiny, the shower just spat water at you and was like warm at best.  Check in staff I dealt with was a lovely guy (didn’t catch his name unfortunately) however we did have to pre authorise a card for a deposit which was not aware of and they would not accept cash.  security staff we came across again all friendly enough.  Be very wary of the young lady on the desk opposite the check in, we were totally duped into 'free passes' if we gave up 2 hours to go and view another of their hotels I quote 'they just want to show you around there’s a lovely rooftop bar etc rtc' what this actually is is trying to seek you a timeshare and viewing one of their apartment blocks, there was no free champagne as Stayed at The New Yorker Hotel from 7/12/2023-14/12/2023. This was my second stay at this Hotel, and again it did not disappoint. Special mention to Charmaine  at check-in. Thank you for allocating us room 1911 . The room was spacious for two people, we had two large extremely comfortable beds, we had a closet each, great for storing our stash of shopping. This room also has a view of The Edge. Also a mention to Marguerita from Housekeeping who did a great job! Thank you for helping me to the elevator with my luggage. The Hotel is within easy walking distance to many sightseeing attractions and shops. There are Subway stations very close by also. Overall we had a great stay, and look forward to returning again on our next visit to NYC NEIDA was amazing. She was helpful in every single way for every aspect of our trip. She offered expertise and advice for our trip and made a reservation for us at the Blue Dog Cafe which was incredible.  The hotel is very well located but in need of some updating. My biggest gripe with this place is the awful customer service when something goes wrong. I left something in the safe by accident and spent £40 on phone calls with 4 promises they would ring me back but not one phone call or reply to e-mail. I know they blame Covid but quite frankly it’s a non existent service.  Attended NYC for the first time for our daughters 16th birthday between 10-14 December and stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker and have to say the location was ideal. Very close to the subway, which is relatively easy to navigate or alternatively a great place to stay and get your steps up each day.   As it was our daughters birthday we decided to pay extra for a room on the 40th floor (4006) and we were so glad we did as the view was fantastic. The Empire State Building was right there every time we looked out of our window, as was a brilliant skyline. The rooms are dated but this adds to the delight of an older hotel. Our room had 2 comfy beds, plenty of drawers and wardrobes, 2 TV’s, 1 in a small sitting room and also a decent bathroom. The room was tended to each day of our Breakfast was included but it consisted of one croissant and glass juice nothing else , location good rooms tiny and decor out dated and no tea coffee facility in room either and then they put 185 pound added at end for city tax and use of facilities and there isn’t any facilities there wouldn’t stay again I cannot, and I mean cannot recommend this hotel enough! We arrived and our room was not quite ready yet so the lovely lady at reception said we could store our bags free of charge. Within 5 mins she advised the room was actually ready so we got our key and headed up to the 40th floor. All I can say is wow! The view from our room was spectacular, comfy bed, comfy pull out sofa and tvs in both the living room and bedroom (we had a queen suite as there were 3 guests). The hotel and rooms are not very modern but I wouldn’t say it’s a bad thing, it felt like the hotel had some history! They even have a little “museum” about the history of the hotel one floor below the lobby.  The tik tok diner adjoined to the hotel is amazing as well, we had breakfast there every day and sometimes The hotel itself is a little dated but the location is excellent, next to penn street station and about a 20 min walk from time square.  The beds are really comfy and the pillows are great.  Bathroom a bit dated too but shower was powerful. Overall a good place to stay for the money and would go back. I went on the 7th to 11th December 23 to New York for the 1st time and stayed at the New Yorker hotel in midtown Manhatten - room was small but it had a comfy bed with nice pillows -  running hot water for shower and bath - TV - phone and wardrobe and drawers it catered for what we needed the room for as you only need it to sleep in - who goes to NYC to spend a lot of time in the hotel room - the staff were very pleasant and helpful - you have access to the tick tock diner and a steak place as well - LOCATION is brilliant very central and subway just across the road to get you further afield or if your not good with walking loads - If i was to ever go again to NYC I would be more than happy to return to this hotel again  not the best hotel in the city.  paid a fortune for a 3 star suite. there was not even a box of tissues in the suite.  the balcony that was feature in the website look nothing like it was. There was nothing to sit outside it was bare.  why offer a balcony suite when you could not even see the city.\"},\n",

Room was small but very clean.  Convenient to everything we were doing.  No need for us to look for different property in the future. When we head to NYC, this will be our go to hotel. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel very much. Our room was very clean and spacious for NYC. The location was perfect—close to Times Square, Central Park, and Rockefeller Center but not right in the middle of the crowds and noise. The front desk and doormen were always friendly and helpful. We will definitely stay here again. This is my second time staying here at the Ameritania and will not be my last! The location is great, nestled within walking distance of areas like Rockefeller Center, the Theater District and the south entrance of Central Park. There are great restaurants and bars nearby, as well as a vast options of nationwide franchises (for those who just need a familiar meal). The rooms are well-equipped with what you need for a stay in the city.  Don’t forget to pack your earplugs, NYC is loud at night! The room and  bathroom were very clean. The beds are confortable. The staff were polite and helpful. I missed having a fridge in the room. There were two bootles of water free in the room during all days, that was good. It was really convinient the umbrella available in the room. I would be back for sure. ⁰ The service was amazing by lipa, Mohammed, majid. The hotel is located near everything. You can walk to almost every must-see In NY. The perfect hotel for your vacation you won\\'t regret it. I would recommend you stay here for your next trip. I know I will I stayed almost a week at this location and it was amazing, the hotel is located just about near everything. The room was clean the room service did amazing job every time we stepped out , the two gentleman at the door were very friendly and hopefully, the front desk were very helpful with reservations since my flight got canceled they made everything more easier and stress free. Majid,lipa,Mohammed were all very friendly and helpful made the stay even more enjoyable. As a person who travels a lot I recommend this hotel . Excellent service and no issues at all with the room . Hotel is well maintained and comfortable. Central location to a lot of the points of interest.   Arrived early and was able to get my room as it was ready. I arrived at 11 am . Very nice surprise! I believe that this is the best option for you and your family in the whole NYC. The location is perfect, you are near Times Square, Central Park, subway stations, car rentals agencies, great restaurants, what more can you want?  Great rooms with lots of space to accomodate your things. The staff is really awsome, they do everything and then some for you to feel comfortable and welcome. A special shout out to Khaula, Sahid and Sebastian. We had a wonderful 3 night stay here. The location is perfect. Close to Times Square, but not right in the middle of it. The hotel was clean, comfortable and updated. We had absolutely no complaints. The staff was courteous and helpful. Jeff, the doorman was the best. He greeted us as soon as we got there and helped us through our stay. He was a pleasure to meet! Wonderful stay in an incredible location. Room was always clean. Fitness center was awesome with great machines. Jeff helped us out a ton on the bell staff service, never had to worry about a thing!! Will definitely come back! Everything was great and the location kept us just out of the busiest of Times Square/New Years Eve traffic. The first room was small but we were quickly upgraded to a decent sized one only a few minutes later. So, thumbs up! Had a pleasantly wonderful experience at Ameritania! My expectations were low because it was in Times Square (expected it to be loud, touristy), and because the price was low (expected it to be cheap). It was the opposite of those expectations! It was a beautiful hotel, well decorated, clean, and welcoming.  Khaoula was an excellent front desk help, getting us checked in and settled quickly and efficiently. She was kind and helpful.  The room felt like a boutique hotel experience - we had two full beds and the room felt huge for NYC accommodations! The bathroom and shower were modern, lots of storage space in the closet, and the room came with a complimentary umbrella for use. Great view of the city, but was unfortunately partially blocked by some scaffolding when we were there. Lovely stay at the Ameritania while visiting for a short stay to go to the nearby Met at Lincoln Center.  Nidel at the front desk was incredibly helpful with all of our needs.  Room was clean and well appointed - on the smaller side, but to be expected in Midtown NYC.  Definitely will return.   Best service , best room , they are the best hotel in New York. Definitely recommend in a very good spot close to everything !! I called them to tell them about me proposing to my girlfriend at there hotel and they upgraded our room and gave us drink vouchers and managed to keep it secretive from them. We are front spain and is out fíes time in USA. We were there at Christmas time. The hotel is very well located.  At reception Gaula was great with us and helped us a lot.  She give us an upgreat for free. She is one angel.  Ameritania at Times Square is one of the best hotels I have stayed at. Bed was super comfy, temperature of room perfect, room darkening curtains made for great sleep.  Location is perfect.  The staff goes beyond with their helpful suggestions of where to go,guidance with subway and transportation, arranging taxi to airport, and best recommendations on where to eat.  Angelo\\'s around the corner is superb. Angelina has wonderful Italian desserts & gelato.  I want to commend all the front desk staff and bellman, and especially Said.  He was so very helpful from the time we arrived to time we departed.  Thank you Ameritania! Great location, short walk to time square, Rockefeller and other attractions. Comfortable room and bedding. Bathroom was a good size. Jeff at the front desk was fantastic, helping organise our transport around the city and to the airport. Highly recommend.  Really great (and quiet!)  little hotel in a very convenient location. It reminded me of the European hotels I’ve stayed in. In fact, many of the other guests had various European accents, so they must get that sense too. Loved it and would definitely stay here again! My grown kids And I loved this iconic classic hotel ! Jeff the doorman made everything run smoothly and we felt like we were at home ! The lobby was modern and had a bar and fireplace! Rooms were quiet! Room was clean, Hotel is conveniently located as we were within walking distance of many \"must see\" NY spots. Our bellman Jeff was great, he was able to get us a shuttle back to the airport at a discounted rate compared to Uber or Lyft. All staff were friendly and helpful.  Been going here for years. They never disappoint me. Jeff the concierge is like family to me. He goes above and beyond to help with whatever we need. Nidal the front desk receptionist made our check in a pleasant experience, kudos to her and her help. Would highly recommend. Great location and convenient to everything. Will be going back next year  We had a great experience with this hotel for our visit. Staff and management were very kind and accomodating for us and our stay. They really went above and beyond our expectations and really made our first trip to New York one to remember  As always, Americana Times Square Hotel was wonderful. My husband and I stayed here 2021 in December.  The room was very nice and the bed was extremely comfortable.  Jeff, our concierge was was very helpful in getting our cab. He suggested Iguana Restaurant for lunch and it was great. I had Salmon and my husband had Prime Rib. Carlos, the Mgr really has a superior restaurant. A thousand thanks to Jeff and Ameritania for a great time in NYC.  Debbie Brincefield from NC  Hotel was in a perfect location, 5 minute walk to Times Square. The hotel was clean and staff were very friendly. Room had air-con which was good. The hotel provided complimentary tea/coffee in the morning and bottled water. Perfect hotel for a city break and would definitely recommend and stay here again! Just did a three night stay at the Ameritania. This location is very close to a lot of attractions. The staff was able to hold our bags prior to checking in which allowed us to explore without carrying our luggage. Overall very pleased. Jeff was very helpful and friendly, always greeting us and assisted with transport to the airport. Great location very close to Lincoln Center,  MoMa and many ither atractions. Also pretty close to subway entrances. Room soundproofing is not the best, but it’s very common in most NYC hotels. Interior rooms have no views , but pretty good soundproofing from exterior noise. The bathroom has been remodeled and is really great. The location is great very central especially if you want thr Theatre district. A very comfortable stay the beds and linen are great. Hotel staff really helpful and friendly especially Khaoula. We will return and recommend to our friends  Most comfortable hotel beds and the waterfall shower head was amazing. Room was clean & continously stocked with waters & towels as we were out & about. Staff was nice & welcoming. Great location too. Great location with lots of sights and restaurants close and very friendly staff. Jeff was helpful in setting us up with airport transportation which was cheaper than a cab or uber. They also offer luggage storage which is a big help.  The place is super well located (in the middle of Manhattan) near Central Park and Times Square. Also what really made difference for me was the treatment given to us by Khaisula  ( really corteous and always ready to help us with our needs - she was awesome :) ). It was an extraordinary experience.  Julia e Arlindo   The Ameritania was a great stay! It was close to everything we wanted to do in manhattan and the staff was very friendly, especially the bellman Jeff! From the beginning of our stay until the end he took care of us! I would definitely recommend staying here. The rooms are clean and spacious. The whole experience of staying here was wonderful from the ever smiling and friendly staff to its wonderful location make this a really great place to stay when in nyc!! Also very easy to get most anywhere!!  We loved this hotel. Took a lot of searching to find something that would suit our needs that wasn’t astronomically expensive.  Rooms are possibly a little tired but they give you everything you need and the beds were fantastically comfortable with great bed linen & good pillows. Bathrooms are a good size. Water pressure was a little sketchy once or twice but only at peak times. We asked for rooms near each other & on high floor away from the lifts which they sorted out for us. There’s a comedy club near the hotel which we could hear at night but given the location it wasn’t too noisy and we slept well.  Free coffee and tea in the lobby every morning. No machines in rooms but it’s easy enough to go get drinks and take them back to the rooms. There’s a bar in the evenings but Amazing support and help, the staff is really great, especially the help from Keenan Davis, really on top of everything and always ready to help. Thank you for making our stay amazing! The location is great and you will be in the heart of NY! Enjoy this amazing place.  Really disappointed and the staff didn’t seem to care. We paid so much money for this hotel and it was a 3 star at best. The room was TINY, considering we were there for 5 days and I asked about an upgrade before arrival and didn’t get a reply I was annoyed. The clock on the wall was broken, mirror not on the wall just leaning against it, toilet door handle broken. The bar closed at 10pm and the person serving was really rude about it, couldn’t wait to leave with the person waiting at the bar for her. Disappointing no tea or coffee making facilities in the room. Room was also so hot and the air con was louder than the traffic from outside. We were met with scaffolding when we arrived and this is all we could see from our window. For the price we paid I am extremely disappointed Actually went on a school trip. This place was fantastic. They couldn\\'t have been more helpful. Looking after our passports ( a lot of them!), helping unload and load the coach, sending maintenance and housekeeping really quickly when one room had a flooded bathroom and broken toilet. The rooms were great, really clean and spacious, drinks in the lobby and plenty of space to gather our party. The location is perfect. Walking distance to anywhere you need, including the metro. A Starbucks, Pret, Macdonalds and a great mini supermarket with deli/coffee bar for all your breakfast/snack/food needs. I would absolutely stay here again, even without 30 teenagers in tow! First I want to mention Jeff one of the bellmen was fantastic! Very helpful and friendly. The hotel overall, our room AC wouldn\\'t work and was stuck at 77 degrees making sleeping not fantastic. Room was clean, lots of attractions nearby. One other minor complaint is we had to replace our room key 3 times because it would stop working, even though we followed guidance of making sure it wasn\\'t next to any cellular devices or credit cards.  This was our first trip to NYC and Ameritania made our experience wonderful. Everyone was so friendly and so helpful. One of the doormen, Jeff, was particularly amazing! He was always greeting us and helping us navigate to where we wanted to go. He remembered us by name and helped us get transportation back to the airport. The fireplace in the lobby was cozy. The room was nice. The shower was hot with good pressure and the pillows were comfortable. We enjoyed our three night stay! My family and I really enjoyed our stay. The staff was amazing and the hotel is located in a great and convenient location. We wanted to give a shoutout to Keenan Davis for his great recommendations and excellent customer service. We will visit again soon!! Hotels in NYC are not cheap, especially for such a good location. It is just a few block from Times Square which is perfect for restaurant and Broadway shows (the main purpose of our trip).  So, this is not a cheap hotel but not outrageous. The problem is that for this price, I would expect a room that is in better shape. The room is small as expected but the furniture is damaged, the mattress is old. The toilet did not flush properly and the shower has no door meaning water all over the floor no matter how careful you are. But this is NYC and you can\\'t expect a 5-star room at this price. My main beef however was check-in. I can\\'t understand why it was taking so long. This is the slowest check-in I have had at a hotel in years. '},\n",

Would definitely recommend this hotel. The HVAC system in this building is not properly functioning. It was 30 degrees outside and despite turning the heat up as high as the system would allow , the room was still too cold for comfort . Unfortunately, we slept in sweatshirts and sweatpants, which is absolutely unacceptable , especially considering that this is a multi billion dollar company .  In addition to the lack of proper heating , the elevators , wifi and their database wasn’t working , which created a less than appealing experience .

Keisha at the front desk was amazing and helped answer many question on my end. She was extremely kind and professional and definitely made us feel welcome. The hotel is conveniently located within a block from the subway and the stay was quiet and relaxing. Considering very good price, location is great (4 subway lines just round the block), room was large to Manhattan standards, perfect and large king bed, a little less comfy the sofa-bed for the children. Good Gym and relax lounge on 12th floor with very useful computer and printer available. Microwave was made available in the room on request (useful to avoid having to eat out every night). Above all extremely good to Manhattan standards, but very good even for worldwide standards, was the crew. Everyone was always greeting us warmly during all our stay.   In particular I\\'d like to mention a lady called Mimi that was on reception on our arrival: I was impressed being warmly greeted and witnessed while waiting  a show of efficiency and kindness. While managing checkout of a large Great experience  Everything was great  Location was great close to Rockefeller center walking and to time square to subway station in the midtown  room was large compared to NYC hotels  Good ,service  clean  room  If I stay in NYC again will try to stay there  Thank you all Julissa, was very helpful and personable. We had the best time ever. She took great care of us during the check in process, and each day she was on shift during our stay. Our flight was canceled on Monday and Mimi helped us out with more accommodations. We were able to stay in our sane room with no issues. I would definitely recommend this property to anyone who is traveling to NYC in the future! The staff was very rude and dismissive.years.    I have never been treated so badly at a Marriott hotel and I have been a member for over 20 years.  I checked into the room and found the sheets were dirty and there was a roach in the room.  I call the front desk about it and they pretty much called me a liar and took almost an hour to get me another room. I would never stay at this place again.  Avoid it at all costs!! We travel to NY City frequently and this is our \"go to\" hotel.  The prices are reasonable (for NY City) and the rooms are definitely larger than the average Manhattan hotel room, but it\\'s the people who are employed at this hotel that keep bringing us back.  Sami Popovic (Assistant General Manager) and Mimi Fernandez (Front Desk/Reception) are two of them who consistently go above and beyond the normal good service to make us feel welcome and keep us coming back.  They take wonderful care of us and make us feel so welcomed and appreciated each and every time we return.   Our experience couldn’t have been better. We have been to the city numerous times but this was our first time at this hotel. It definitely won’t be our last! We had a Junior Suite and it was the biggest room I’ve seen for a NYC hotel. We had my husband, myself and three teenage boys and we never once felt like we were stepping over each other.   The staff was incredibly friendly, taking the time to even learn my boys’ names. They were helpful, welcoming and even when police started shutting down streets around the hotel because of an underground leak, the staff went out of their way to make sure we didn’t feel put out by the inconvenience. I’m sure they were stressed even though it was no fault of the hotel itself, but they never showed it. Guided everyone through a different What a delightful and accommodating stay at this Courtyard! As a family of five, the double queen suite, complete with a sofa bed, provided ample space for us. The front desk staff was exceptionally welcoming, and the breathtaking views, coupled with immaculate cleanliness and proximity to everything, made our experience exceptional. We wholeheartedly recommend this hotel and certainly plan to return! We had a wonderful stay.  The front desk crew were so friendly and helpful.  And we met Sammi, who was delightful.  She was so friendly and chatted with our grandsons and offered us a snack.  Perfect location.   We will be back!    This is my go to hotel in NYC. It’s has it all. Great location, big comfortable rooms and most importantly a friendly and efficient team to care for you. Easy to get to all of the sites in the greatest city! The lady named Aixa was an amazing Guest Service Agent. We immediately felt at home upon arrival in the lobby. She took care of us from A to Z. We highly recommend this property and look forward to our next stay.  Excellent stay at Courtyard Midtown NYC. Michael at the front desk and the team at the Bistro were excellent.   We had to reschedule our trip last minute and there was a little confusion on the assigned room when we arrived but Michael took care of it right away!  Also the room was quite spacious for NYC. Alexi was as professional as they come! He was helpful, attentive, and offered me a wonderful corner suite with an excellent rate! He also helped with my luggage. As for the the room it was huge, with a high ceiling and stunning views. 1 of the biggest hotels rooms I\\'ve stayed in in NYC. It was an awesome stay.  Hotel great but paid for extras in cash then was charged on my credit card! Took it up with the manager but never heard back. Location wasn’t a problem for us as we love to walk everywhere and found great places to eat. Once you’ve worked out the trains it’s easy to commute too Here for 8 full days on business with a lot of down time. (This is my 2nd time staying at this location) I feel this is a no frills hotel and room. Which totally works out as I’m sure most are here for business and to site-see! The rooms are clean, tv is big, bedding nice! The staff here is just phenomenal! From the moment you walk in, to every time you pass by the front desk they are extremely friendly. The crew on the 12th floor is super friendly when you stop for a coffee, and my housekeeper for almost the length of my stay m, Joan, is amazingly nice and accommodating! She addsTLC to your o and always has a smile and nice works when you see her! She was a delight! The whole staff was! Thanks Courtyyard Team for making me feel so welcome! I totally recommend this hotel for the We had a group at this hotel, fantasic service. Zachary Kranitz in Sales to Farah Aoucher Group Sales Coordinator both made everything seemless. All my clients said staff was extremely friendly, rooms very nice. We will be hosting all our NY meetings at this property moving forward.  From a super speedy pickup by James (our knowledgeable friendly driver) to the final checkout, our brief stay here was fabulous. A warm smile and hot chocolate welcomed us and the rooms were clean and tidy and only a short hop from JFK. Just want to thank Mimi at the front desk.  She went out of her way to arrange connecting rooms for us.  Really appreciate her help.    On a separate note.  Wish the hotel would have self service laundry machines.   We came down from New York on my birthday and the staff was super friendly and polite when we arrived! We arrived fairly early and was able to check in early and got an upgrade  to the room as well! Got a beautiful city side view! Will be returning here! Thanks for the professionalism!! Our meeting location fell through a week prior to a quarterly board meeting in NY.  I worked directly with Farah Aoucher who was accommodating and very helpful with finding us space for our meeting as well as all of the technical needs and food.   The hotel was clean, location was superb, and the overall service was 5 star!  Thanks Farah One of the best hotel experiences in a long time. Housekeeping was excellent and room was always nice and clean. Front desk staff was amazingly nice. Location is great because you are close to everything and across the street from the subway but it was actually nice and quiet at night both in and out of the hotel. Fifth avenue was a five minute walk away. Didn’t use any of the amenities at hotel other than luggage storage. Breakfast was not included but not a big deal. Would definitely stay here again. This is a great hotel. About half a mile from La guardia (just be weary of traffic hour it’ll take you over an hour…not the hotels fault but just fyi)). This hotel was very clean, had a floor that sold coffee and breakfast items, is close to the subway and other places and had the nicest staff (especially Sabrina which helped us first timers know which subway train to take) and very safe. I would definitely stay here again.  I am a veteran event producer who made this Marriott my production teams home for several days. I am so tremendously grateful to Zach Kranitz and Farah Aoucher for their incredible hospitality and professionalism in organizing my large group of 20 rooms plus. Besides their amazing efforts to make all of our needs smooth, the free 12th floor office space in the hotel was a crucial bonus to setting up our 400 person event nearby. And ofcourse, my room was large and perfect for my long stay. Comfortable beds too.  Check in staff were fun and lively. I am so grateful for this wonderful team and experience! Front desk service was outstanding!! Location is great.  Very clean, neat and spacious rooms.  The size of the room exceeded my expectations, since it\\'s in Manhattan I wasn\\'t expecting to get such a large room.  The hotel has Starbucks on 12th floor.  Lobby has a room with snacks, drinks, ice cream, and basic essentials like pills for headaches and cold. I will definitely be coming back again! And I highly recommend this hotel.   We were supposed to stay 2 nights, but something came up and we had to leave early. Without us asking the front desk issued a partial refund! I was shocked! Never expected that, and was embarrassed to even ask if it\\'s possible! They did it without us asking.   My wife and I took two of our children and my daughter\\'s friend.  The room was comfortable and clean.  The hotel staff was very friendly and responsive.  The hotel was located near many major attractions.  We were within walking distance of Grand Central Station, the Chrysler building, and 5th Avenue shopping.  The subway station was across the street.   We were able to jump on and off the subway to get downtown and to other parts of Manhattan and NYC. The rooms are very large (which is rare in New York City) and the staff was so friendly and helpful. For breakfast they have their own Starbucks on the 12th floor! We will stay here again. Alexi at the front desk took great care of us! Really comfortable hotel, good location. Rooms incredibly comfortable and well kept and cleaned. Beds very comfortable. If I had to find any fault, it would be that I would have liked more water pressure in the shower, but what there was wasn’t bad. When I arrived, Julissa Diaz couldn’t have been more helpful. I was by myself and she offered to come out to the car to assist me with luggage. She then checked me in and brought my luggage to the room with me. My friends arrived later that day and the next day. She continued to check on us and offer us waters and her assistance. Guest services and the room attendants were also amazing. We were more than pleased with our stay and Julissa clearly contributed to that.  This is the most convenient, centrally located hotel for anything you\\'d like to do in Manhattan! All staff we encountered were pleasant and accommodating from the front desk to the breakfast restaurant. The room was clean and very comfortable and the view for rooms on the south side is amazing! We will be back! Great location, friendly staff - very helpful.  Rooms serviced alternate days but that was not an issue.  Clean tidy with good facilities.  Like all big cities homelessness and drugs are a feature.  This was not an issue for us but always be mindful Beyond the good midtown location this hotel is one of the most poorly run and maintained I’ve stayed in in years.  Even for a Marriott this place is bad. The lighting in the rooms is nonexistent, particularly in the bathroom. Easy to cut your face shaving because there’s virtually no light over the sink.  Toilet didn’t work right no water pressure in shower.   There is a gym, but I would call it a fitness closet. It is so tiny that when three people are in the place it’s hard to move around and not functional.  Personally, I’d give it a rating of “avoid” unless you needed to be in that neighborhood. I would not recommend staying here. And the prices are upwards of $500 for this. Essentially low level budget hotel. Great location for a budget-friendly Midtown hotel. Room was fine but what makes this a great place is the awesome front desk staff. Giving a big shout out to Mara in housekeeping. I was there less than 24-hours so while I didn’t experience housekeeping service, I did meet Mara who was so friendly and warm with her greetings and it really helped start my day off right! Thanks Mara!  Also, I witnessed the front desk team manage a guest whose baseline temperament appeared to be rude and entitled, she even cut in front of me in line to checkin - but the team was kind and handled it with grace.  I had a great stay and Henry was very helpful! Staff have been friendly and hotel is very clean. This is a very long min word count for a review and I don’t have much else to say except that I would stay again  This was our first school visits for my daughter (St Johns , Fordham both Manhattan and Bronx campuses, everything was close , we were able to get in some family time for ourselves and unwind. for 2 adults and our teen a king bed and sofa was sufficient it allowed us time to go over everything we observed at the schools together. I would recommend Courtyard New York East to anyone needing a stay in NYC , the Staff was more than accommodating at all times The staff was unanimously friendly, helpful, and understanding of this family of 5. The room was clean, the cleaning staff tucked in our toddler’s snugglies, we had a great view, and the location was great for subway rides to Central Park and Penn Station, and walks to both neighborhood restaurants and all the stores of Midtown. Lovely and efficient front desk! Little shop with essentials before you go up to your room. Rooms nice clean and large. Great location to access subway and other attractions in nyc. Many great restraunts within walking distance. And room was quite! Perfect location with metro around the corner. Staff was amazing, very courteous and promptly complied to our requests of extra sheets and towels. Plenty of places to eat next to hotel.Beds and pillows were comfortable. We have been staying at this Courtyard Marriott once a month for the past year.  Midtown Manhattan is a very busy place, and this is a very busy hotel.  However, there are several staff people at this hotel who make all the difference in the world.  Mimi, Adwoa and Julissa, each of whom are at the front desk, are simply wonderful.  They remember us when we arrive, and are warm and friendly.  They make us feel so welcome -- like family.  I can\\'t say enough about them.  This hotel wouldn\\'t be the same without these extraordinary people.  '},\n",

Excellent location and rooms . Lovely reception and seating areas and lovely staff everything you need in a room in such a central location . Easily accessible for all subway journeys and close enough to most attractions to walk  I am so confused as to why there are so many negative reviews,  We arrived at the hotel at 1pm due to an earlier arrival on our flight,  I was stressing because I knew check in was 4pm but I thought I would ask if we could leave our luggage somewhere for a few hours, The receptionist actually checked us in to our room 3 hours early, and not just me, but every guest that was on our flight,  I was very grateful for this!  We were also able to keep our room until 2pm for an additional fee, Yes, we had to pay Tax, but going into New York this is obvious, You pay tax on the majority of stores in New York, so why would a hotel be any different?  The rooms are small, they are basic, however they come with a lot of additional facilities,  A large tv with cable, and a variety of this Hotel for the prices is very good great location to Times Square and the theaters in the area.  close to subway stations and bus routes.  room was clean and for just me was a good size nice bathroom  Was in a good location, 1 min from times square. Friendly and helpful staff. The hotel was dark inside, but was lovely. Rooms where also a good size. And the beds where comfortable. The hotel was on the same street if you where wanting to see a broadway show.  This hotel is in a great location, right near times square but beware that it is a very very busy road that gets stuck with both works, cars and people! The foyer is very nice, clean and plenty of seating but the rooms need updating and refreshing. The beds are comfy but the bathrooms need things fixing. This hotel is ideal for exploring NY and just needing a bed for the night. The staff are not overly helpful, we had an issue with our air con unit (in their extreme humid heatwave) and we asked someone to look at it twice, and no one ever came!  There is also a long wait for lifts if you leave in the morning or come back at certain busy times. Great place to stay no hassle rooms are nice all refurbished beds are comfy bath and shower on hand staff are nice plenty seats to make your self comfy while you wait on your taxi or friends plenty off lifts to take you to your room rooms are nice and warm would definitely stay again If it\\'s your first time, this hotel is a good choice since it is 30 seconds from Times Square. You can easily access all the important places and broadway is right across the street. If you\\'ve been to NY before I don\\'t believe this hotel does enough to justify you spending money there. There are many other options for the same price but with much better value. Unless you value the time to get to Times Square, I believe there are better options. I have stayed at the Paramount several times before and I like it because it is very centrally located, convenient to all the theaters and the restaurants on 8th and 9th Avenues and is a very comfortable hotel. The staff is very helpful. I was travelling alone and stayed in a single which was fine and suited my needs for the time I was in NYC. The single room is small and during the rest of the year would be no problem but in the winter, there is really limited space to hang up coats, etc. The closet space is limited even for one person. In terms of bathtub safety, either a grab bar should be installed along the back wall /side wall.  Decals should be placed on the floor of the tub or a rubber bath mat provided to avoid an unfortunate accident. Another thing which would be ideal Morbid charm but still clean, good mattresses and very friendly staff. Recommendable if you want to stay in midtown manhattan. The construction site across the street will take some time but does not really bother. I wasn’t looking forward to staying here as some of the reviews were awful. I stayed with my two granddaughters and it was a two double bedded room. I found it perfectly adequate for the three of us. It was clean, the towels were changed daily. The shower was adequate, plenty of hot water. When we arrived the room safe wasn’t working the maintenance man came straight away but he couldn’t fix it, so they bought us a new safe. The reception staff are very pleasant and helpful. The reason for only four stars, we were on the front and there was quite a draft from the window which made the building work sound even louder, also there was quite a smell of weed throughout the hotel. Other than that I would certainly recommend this hotel and if I’m ever in New York again would certainly After reading recent reviews I was pretty anxious on arrival with my husband and 2 daughters. But reception checking was very quick and easy, our 2 double bedroom was grand, not huge but never expected it to be big in NYC. All clean & comfortable. We were at the front of the hotel in 12th floor. Building site opposite started each weekday morning at 7am and as the air con unit is part of window it sounds like window is open. Thankfully I’d brought ear plugs so we were fine (and awake early too with time difference from home!)  We used the gym each day and was great. Location was unreal, 30 sec walk to time square. Perfect for what we wanted. Staff all very friendly and nice coffee shop on corner as you walk out to right for breaky each day. I would certainly stay here again. First, the location is excellent, very close to Times Square.  I stayed in a single room.  Of course, it was small, but it was clean and convenient.  I recommend this room if you travel alone.  The staff were very kind.  I left my luggage bags in the hotel after checkout, and they charged only $3.     OK so I was very very nervous about this hotel after reading all the negative reviews. But in all fairness we arrived at 2.30 & was checked in quickly reception lady was very welcoming & friendly, we were given a room upgrade. Our room was a decent size a large double I\\'d say, was clean & tidy & did us fine for our stay we took a travel kettle & hot drinks which was a life saver if you are desperate for a coffe before heading out in the mornings, otherwise theres no cups in the the room, there is facilities for cold/hot water also ice machine on the 4th floor, we had fresh towels & room was cleaned  daily, We didnt use any of the hotels facilities so cant comment on those but its very dark (dim) in the lobby & throughout the corridoors, The location is the key factor, its This hotel is a nightmare, we visited here from the 31st-7th of January 2024 travelling all the way from Scotland we were very excited about the experience, we paid roughly £2000 for this hotel for the week, once we arrived we were told we had to pay an extra £300 which was a “maintenance fee” after being given our room key and reaching our room we were shocked to see the state of the room and the size of it, we could each every corner of the room from the one place, not only that but the place was filthy, and the tv was broken, after complaining we were told that they couldn’t move us that night due to being fully booked, and we were left to spend new years the most important night in a tiny, filthy room with no tv. This trip was for four friends. Room experience not that great. It is for small families does not work for large group of people. I wouldn’t recommend for friends. No amnesties included. No free breakfast or parking. Had a brilliant 5 night stay at the paramount. Fantastic location. Very good value for money. Very clean and friendly staff. Would defiantly recommend to friends and family and when we hopefully return again to NYC will stay here again.  Checked in and started to look for another hotel straight away , hotel smelt of drugs throughout , room disgusting , dirty, mould, bed all ripped, no heating , safe broken . Found another hotel for the following 9 nights . Still waiting call from hotel manager 7 days after I left him voicemail, do not stay here  Website photos made the rooms appear larger and nicer than they are in actuality.  Our carpets were a little bit stained.  People were smoking quite a bit of weed in the hallways but it\\'s New York City and that appears normal.  Overall our stay was good and the staff was friendly.  Thanks! Too much to comment on, location is the only positive for this hotel. Broken, dirty, run down, not secure, outdated, poor room layout, lacking amenities. Sketchy people ride the elevators with you. Lack of attention to detail in literally every way.  Spent 5 nights here with my family. Staff were very nice. The hotel was always clean with fresh towels etc. The loction was perfect and you got value for money. All other bad reviews do NOT reflect my experience.  If you want 5 Star luxury then pay for it. Just one point. Rooms are small for a family of 4. Beds could have been slighly bigger.  Thanks Paramount.  The room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was small but had plenty of hot water and good water pressure. My only complaint was the thermostat in the room didn\\'t work. It wasn\\'t set on \"heat\" when we checked in. I changed the setting and increased the temperature a few degrees. The temperature in the room never went up all night long. In fact, it went down a degree instead. Otherwise, loved the location as our theatre was right across the street and the beds were comfy for us to spend a night in. Location is great, staff is helpful and friendly. My friends and I felt safe with the door guard during the night. The room is your average hotel room in terms of space and comfort - it’s clean and not noisy.  The place is in great location (46th st.) and the checkin and check out fast and accurate BUT due to the construction site right in front of it sleeping after 7 o\\'clock was almost impossible. Not having even a pare of glass for water in the room was also very \"unexpected\" and when I tried to get it @ front desk they told me to \"try the bar\" (??) - Not whats I was expecting to get from the Hotel staff :-(  The location is good, but the customer service is terrible, we complained to the night manager and he only told us what we wanted him to do!!! that he couldn\\'t control it, but for 05 days and they can\\'t do anything, that\\'s incredible, We really enjoyed our stay, the rooms were small however we expected this prior to arrival. The resort fees for 5 night were 89 dollars and 1 dollar charge for damages. The staff on reception were extremely friendly as were the maids bar staff etc the only downfall really was the noise at night but suppose this is to be expected in the city that never sleeps. We will deffo return thank you. Great location! In the middle of Time Square, accordingly very loud in the evening. The beds were very comfortable and you got new shampoo every day, etc. Wenn man sein Gepäck dort abgeben möchte, dann kostet es pro Gepäckstück 3$.  This place is terrible! The rooms are cramped and dated, there isn’t even any water on the rooms. The bathroom was dated and old and smelly as the fan didn’t work. The windows didn’t fit properly and the road noise was awful. We were booked for 10 nights, we had to leave after 3 as we were so miserable.  My family had a great experience while staying at the Paramount for NYE. No complaints and the staff were extremely helpful in making sure our stay was memorable. The staff were very accommodating in making sure we had an excellent night. Highly recommend. Let\\'s just say I believe that this hotel benefits from it\\'s proximity to Times Square (less than a block) and regardless of what I say, people will continue to book rooms here b/c of it\\'s location alone. Sadly the hotel amenities, which looked amazing from the hotel\\'s website were not as advertised. First off, the lobby lighting was like \"club\" lighting 24/7....why so dark ALL THE TIME....and the website touts a bar + game room, which due to traveling with another family, and wanting to have a common meeting area and area to possibly kill time (without spending money at a restaurant/bar) is NO LONGER a hotel amenity...the hotel bar is but doesn\\'t open until 5 pm but the \"game room\" area has been walled off and is hotel storage.....The hotel doesn\\'t seem to think the year is 2024 The hotel is located in a strategic position, the staff is helpful and the romm is small but confortable. It is ideal for a stay in NY; the hotel is near times square, broadway, central park, Moma etc.. You can visit the city on foot.  Ugly, bad bedrooms. Booked 4 nights for a good an amount of $ but had to move rooms twice due to various problems with amenities; then eventually had no choice but settle down to get through the time: outdated ugly bedrooms lacking basic amenities, Smelly bathroom (fans not working), sink and bathtubs damaged; rooms are super small with no actual view; no water and coffee in the room, limited towels. Unfriendly staff. Felt like a cheap hostel in bedrooms, although lobby looks fancy. Weird!     What an amazing place for the amazing price. As soon as you walk into the lobby it takes your breath away. Very nice. The lift was a little dated. Now the room again couldn\\'t ask for anything more for the price it was a great room and bathroom, the view.. there wasn\\'t one but oh well.   it was excellent I loved my stay there and I will be back soon by the way there was a lady at the reception she is impeccable a very young lady i dont remember her name the welcome was very warm I congratulate the team and the service is impeccable This hotel is in a fantastic location, if you want to be in the centre of it all then this is the hotel for you.   The hotel lobby is beautifully decorated and the check in was smooth and the staff were friendly.   However, the rooms are tiny and are in desperate need of updating. We upgraded to a Queen Superior Room and still felt like this was tiny. Nowhere proper to store away your clothes and leaving your suitcase out takes up most of the room. The thermostat was useless, difficult to control and turn on/off.   The plug sockets are awful, make sure you take a type B socket as otherwise the plug will fall out of the wall. My hair dryer didn’t work so I had to use the one provided by the hotel and my partner had to hold the plug in the wall!  Even though you’re not allowed to We were overall pleasantly surprised by the Paramount Hotel Times Square.  Great location and the staff were all so friendly and helpful.  Room was very small and there weren\\'t many amenities (no water bottles - was directed to purchase a water bottle from the bar).  It would\\'ve been nice if the bar served food.  The rooms and elevators could be upgraded a bit but they were fine, especially for the price.  We asked for extra towels and pillows and they were delivered to the room, which was wonderful.  Again, overall, it was a great experience and we will most likely return.   I stayed at this hotel back in January 2023. I was glad to pick this location because it was super convenient to all the limelight Times Square has to offer, including fancy restaurants, broadway shows, etc.  The customer service was very professional, and the staff are bilingual, so any native Spanish speakers would be comfortable staying here. I am not sure if they speak other languages, but English & Spanish are definitely the primary ones in this hotel.  Upon entering my room, I felt a bit of regret for choosing this place- It was so SMALL! I had to laugh to hide my pain.  Although I was a solo traveler, I never had a room as tiny as this. A small, twin-sized bed with an even skinner closet (some of the space being blocked off by a safe). The bathroom wasn\\'t inviting at all, Awful smell and DIRTY room, no drinking water, NOISY Air Conditioning, NO HOT WATER IN THE BATHROOM. The kindness of the front desk staff does not make up for the low quality of this establishment which is not worth the price charged. greedy, cheep, junk  staff n0 personality where is  my money as resort fees , even thought reservation said everything included ac n0izy  continues headache thieves bad experiance i as0 saw an0ther sh0cked cust0mer at recipti0n Would not recommend this hotel  Rooms are shabby, dirty, noisy and expensive. It needs a refurb or a deep clean. The photos on the website must have been taken years ago and are very misleading. Stay away '},\n",

But we didn’t get any of the things it lists on their website. The internet was This is my second stay here. Great location right next to Times Square. Got a free upgrade for my birthday which was a big plus. The room in the 18th floor was upgraded and modern. Bathroom lovely with rain shower head and good pressure. Not alot of counter space though. Room very clean. Front desk service friendly and helpful. Although no valet, parking easy just around the corner. Easy to walk to many places from this hotel.  This is my second stay at this hotel. I would stay again. The non upgraded rooms are a bit more aged but we’re still clean. For me, you aren’t going to NYC to just stay in the hotel, but this is a very good one at an affordable price point.  The air conditioners are so load that you’d think the building was about to take off.   The walls are thin enough to hear the conversation from the adjacent room.   The plaster from bathroom ceiling was falling down. The key cards didn’t work half the time, the receptionist were rude and not helpful at all. Be aware.  All staff are great and very friendly.  Breakfast was an added bonus just agrab and go pastry, fruit and drink. The beds are super comfy. Good TV and powerful shower. Downsides... do not stay on 5th floor there\\'s a noisy generator. We had to change rooms and moved to 14th floor which was great. The drains need sorting the sink drained so slowly  and when.you showered a load of drain dirt, come up into the bath.  With a bit of tlc this hotel could be amazing. We had a good view out of our window. If you are just in need of a place to take a warm shower and a quick nap while you are in the city then this it. The hotel staff is great, but the actual hotel is blah and the walls are thin! Trip of a lifetime turned into a NIGHTMARE   My Daughter and I stayed at this hotel from 2.1.24 - 6.1.24. On our arrival we were immediately charged 200 dollars we were not expecting this payment as we believe we had paid in full prior to the trip. There was no disclosure there were going to be any additional charges. We were then escorted to our room on the 8th Floor. I have never experienced such an appalling room. Dirty, Stains on carpets, Dirty walls, Hair in bath, Plugs sockets that did not work, along with a TV which did not work. You could hear conversations through the walls from other residents. This was meant to be a trip of a lifetime it was quickly becoming a NIGHTMARE.    We went to reception and requested an upgrade we paid an extra 626 dollars and were told once The Manhattan at Times Square has been my go-to spot to stay in the city for the past few years now and I don\\'t see that changing any time soon!   The attached parking garage makes driving into the city a convenient and affordable option, the location of the hotel could not be more perfect if you\\'re in town for a show, and the staff are consistently kind, helpful, and accommodating at all times!   It\\'s not the fanciest spot, but it still has lovely amenities and it definitely gets the job done. I highly recommend! So I spent 7 days at the manhattan hotel it was nothing like what we believed was booked.  We understood we were in an apartment rooms large enough for a 69 year old lady and two 30 year grandson.  But it turned out to be a small room we 3 were so shocked we went straight down to reception to complain.  The receptionist was helpful but I was I was shocked by her suggestions.  I should let my young grandson help me out of the bath I was not impressed at all.  It spoilt our time in New York and I would not go back nor recommend anyone stay here if you do check the room you book and check it again then get it in  writing before you go to be safe. So very disappointed.  DO NOT GO HERE! This hotel is absolutely terrible. Absolutely appalling customer service from the outset. When we got to our room, the bathroom was covered in mould and the bathtub had filthy muddy stains. There was also no air conditioning. We then moved to a different room after informing the manager. There was no air conditioning in this room and it was extremely stuffy and unbearable. We contacted the manager who called the engineer. The engineer came to assess the situation, however his response was \"hotels in New York do not have air conditioning during the Winter\", which is a completely ridiculous and false statement to make. I responded that I understood it was Winter, but people adapt to differing climates differently, so the option of both heating and air conditioning I don\\'t even know where to start. At check in, we were told that they had overbooked and so the 2 rooms with double beds that we had PREPAID for would be single rooms with cots. Then we had to bring our luggage back downstairs the next morning so they could give us the correct rooms the next day (we were without a room at all while they got the correct rooms \"ready\"). The first rooms and second set of rooms were dirty, dilapidated and not even stocked with \"amenities\". You would think that after having to inconvenience us so much, they would give us a room with more than one coffee cup, more than one towel, perhaps a room with a LOCK or a Do Not Disturb sign. We didn\\'t have a radio and when we asked for one we were given a power strip. The bathtub dripped nonstop... literally We wanted to come see the city for the first time. We couldn\\'t have chosen a better hotel. The location is prime and the rooms are perfect for a getaway. The rooms aren\\'t huge but they are clean, cozy, and quiet. Overlooking the city and a short walk to Times Square we were in the heart of all the action. Firstly we booked a room for a family of 4. At check in we were told they didn’t have a room for 4 people . After an hour we had to split up 1 adult and 1 child in one room and the other adult and child in another  .  The rooms we were given were dirty, old and not fit for anyone to stay in . Dirty carpets , electric extension leads and cables all tangled and across the floor so dangerous . Curtains hanging off rail , massive gaps under the door so noisy all night from the corridor . No toiletries , tv didn’t work and wallpaper hanging off the wall . We had no choice but to try and sleep in them for our first night as there was no alternative .  Based on this experience I would not recommend this hotel . We have seeked a refund but have been told this was a standard room and The worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in  Had to move rooms because the smell was so bad, smelt like a chain smoker lived in the room. Next room was OK but to be frank we were just delighted to be away from the smell, anything was an upgrade at this point. the hotel is so dated it’s not been updated in probably 70 years (no joke) and the pictures are very deceiving. Not very clean and the bathroom had stains all in the sink, dirt all round the corners and the ceiling looked like it was going to fall down. The reception is nicely done but that is frankly as far as it goes, even the hallways as you come out of the lift are a major dive and the white paint has turned yellow at this point. You can book many hotels in the same area for the same price if not cheaper with way better reviews   Don\\'t spend your money in that Hotel the rooms are horrible the hotel it\\'s so old a looks like never had Maintenance and the person that make the check in and check out. It was so slowly and there was only one person We arrived early evening and was informed they needed to take a credit card as there was a $250 tax to pay, but we would receive $45 back on check out, still not received this. On entering the room, it was obvious it was only set up for 3 people and there was 4 of us. The room was very dirty.   Speaking to reception next morning they said we could move rooms, the new room would be ready around 2pm.  At 2:30pm we spoke to the manager and he said he would sort out the room, he then gave me the same room that we had moved out of that morning.  I informed him that this was not acceptable as it was not big enough for the 4 of us and it was dirty.  The manager then spoke down to me and over me when I tried to speak.    The manager’s shift finished at 3pm, the replacement manager said The location is the best. The hotel is in need of repair and renovations. The room had old carpets and no controls for air and heat. While the room was warm it is nice and an amenity to have control access to temps. My initial room had a random bug on the bed. I was promptly moved to another room. That room had no temp controls & stained curtains. The walls are thin. The staff was very nice. I would give the hotel now a 2 ⭐️ star. It has potential due to the great location. Needs updating ASAP. I called it the Red Roof Inn of Times Sq.  DO NOT STAY HERE - My goodness, Where to start. I can’t express enough to not pay a penny for this place  Photos on their website are completely false of the room we got.  As a family of 4, 2 young teenagers and mum and dad.  First impressions were ok, foyer reception area looks standard and relatively clean.  Waited an hour for our room as the receptionist said they were overbooked. When we got to our room, it wasn’t dirty, it was filthy. The door didn’t lock at all. Carpet filthy, hot tap didn’t work, rusty bath plug surround and the beds were disgusting.  We were staying for 6 nights and after going back to reception we were informed unless you were on the one floor with new refurbished rooms, all rooms were like the one we were put in. They couldn’t offer us a different room Fantastic hotel, excellent location.  Beds comfy and cleaning service excellent 👌  rooms cleaned everyday.  Breakfast every morning at the take away coffee Dock. We meet a lovely gentleman  named Shamu Choudhury who brightned our morning,  looked after us really well. Highly recommend this hotel  Dilapidation is the best way to describe all of it. The room, staff, cleanliness, check in process. Everyone seemed tired and bored and interaction was a chore for each. You could clearly see the preference of each staff member to be left alone, unbothered by these things called guests.  Booking through an online service? They cite that to be the reason they are incapacitated for whichever thing you might seek.  Did not get the rooms reserved and prepaid for the first night. Was given rooms with uncomfortable cots in rooms that were too small for them. Was without a room for 4 hours while they switched us on the second day. Rooms need renovation. Could not plug in the lamp, telephone and coffee pot all at once. Day manager was nice and tried to make things right. Night manager was “busy” and refused to appear to speak with a long line of unhappy guests or to help check in guests.  Was looking for a place to stay for a first time visit to NYC. So happy to have found the Manhattan at Times Square. Absolutely great experience in perfect location! I was traveling with 2 children, very family friendly. Checkin was absolutely amazing. No wait and Allison was wonderful. She helped us a lot and gave my daughter a sweet gift.  The room was nice and clean. We went out for the night as it was Christmas season and returned around 7pm to put my daughter to bed. We heard a bunch of loud construction going on in the room above us and I figured it would end by 10pm. At 10:45 I called down to ask when it’ll stop as we couldn’t sleep. They said any minute. I called back down at 12am and was told a similar story and that the rooms were all booked and I couldn’t move my family. At 1:20am I was told that she “already talked to you and I don’t know when it will stop”. The lady offered me $35. I spent over $800 on the room for the night. We finally dozed off around 3am due to exhaustion. We had Visited New York for my 80th birthday. Fabulous place . We were upgraded to the executive suites. Stunning !  The staff were so friendly. The rooms were huge. Comfortable bed. Shower room was  unbelievable. Fresh towels and lovely toiletries every day. Can\\'t wait to go back   Rude and do nothing to help resolve your request.  Do not answer front desk or housekeeping calls, ever!  Room temperature goes to 74 and they have heater on.  In order to cool the room, their solution was to open the windows and gave me a box fan.  It felt like I was in South America. My parents stayed here for 3 nights right before Christmas. I met them to help them with their bags and check in and get settled. Check in experience was fine but on arriving to the room on 5th floor, I have to say it was a bit of a shock. I understand that the Hotel was built in 1962, I didn’t realise that meant nothing had been upgraded since 1962 either. The room was dull, dated and musty looking and smelling.  Shortly after getting them settled we noticed blood on the pillow and pillowcase and had to phone reception to ask for a new pillow and case.  The Receptionist had warned that the air con in the room was a little fiddly on check in - what this actually meant was that it was broken. On their last night they had to change rooms which took hours - the cold had simply We didn\\'t know we had breakfast until our last night there I was told we had to pay for parking. Later on, our last night we found out we had free parking For the price we paid we should have had bett  Arrived here and was pleasantly surprised - the room was spacious and comfortable and had everything we needed for a few days before we flew to our next destination.  Central and close to all the amenities.  Very helpful and friendly staff.  Family holiday so split over 2 rooms but on the same floor.  Would stay again. I checked into The Manhattan at Times Square Hotel on  a Friday night for a weekend stay.   I had no idea what this hotel was like.  It was my first time staying there.  Photos and descriptions can be deceiving at times.  I was running out of time in booking accomodations, when \"The Manhattan\" came up on a web search.  Their rates suited my budget.  I was impressed by  the photos of various rooms.  And, I did read a few reviews.   Most were good, but there were a few that were critical of various  things.  Here are the things I like about this hotel:  Awesome location on 7th Avenue is just a short walk to an MTA station.   The staff at this motel (Front Desk, Housekeeping, Stewards and Attendants) were just awesome.  The Manhattan at Times Square Hotel is listed as a 3 star We booked 2 rooms and requested 10 months in advance  adjoining rooms as had 2 children. When arrived did not get. Told ‘sorry’ only a request. Would have moved hotels then and there but non refundable. Walked in to room wanted to walk straight out. Wanted to cry. So disgusting.  Rooms were disgusting. Old and dated. No bar fridge. Wall paper peeling. Bathroom disgusting. Overcharged resort fee as what was stated in Agoda booking. Do not stay here!!!! Staff at reception rude and not welcome- response to questions ‘next’. This hotel was absolutely filthy I checked out after one night. The receptionist who checked us in (Raquel) was so aggressive and rude. The room was filthy and the bedding had an awful smell. We were kept awake all night by the industrial freezer outside our room along with shouting and banging. This was not helped by the fact our room door had a huge gap at the bottom. There was a constant smell of cannabis as well. The hotel shop assistant was so rude when I purchased water, the whole experience is the worst I have ever encountered. I paid a deposit for “incidentals” for the week and after checking out early after 1 night I was advised this would be refunded in 3-5 business days and I have still not been refunded. The only helpful and kind person I encountered there was Check in was friendly and efficient porters took cases to room immediately rooms are dated and everything above the reception area requires a good overhall and decorating but can they afford to shut rooms down. Location is 20 / 10 on the corner of 7th Avenue 51st Street a short walk to Times Square enjoyed people watching when other customers queued for their breakfast. Hotel was extremely busy as 3 weeks to Christmas when we stayed here. Yes we would stay here again it’s clean and the beds were very comfortable. Just back from 5 nights here, no way is it a 4 star,  they lady who checked us in was abrupt, the room had a musty smell, there was things broken, the only thing this hotels got going for it is its location, but don\\'t expect too sleep, between the pipes sounding like there\\'s a ships horn going off and the noise from everything else round about its not very relaxing, but I do get its new york , the lifts are a nightmare, 20 minutes i waited with my cases but eventually had to drag them down the stairs, I\\'m sure there\\'s better hotels for the same money, this hotels seriously needing renovated  Honestly had no complains, nice cosy clean room which was attended to and beds done every day we was there. Beds are so compfy we all slept like babies.....Hot running water, fresh towels. Only negative the check in staff wouldn\\'t know customer service if they tried  After reading the negative reviews was quite concerned about just how bad this hotel was.   Pleasantly surprised. Yes it’s dated, but our room was clean & comfortable. Room was cleaned every day. Staff were friendly. Grab and go breakfast was included.   Location is ideal.   We have all agreed that if we were to return we would stay here again.  Room was dated but clean & comfortable, carpets on corridors need replacing, we had no complaints staying here we didn’t go to nyc to spend lots of time in our room so a nice warm comfy bed & a hot shower with clean towels was all we needed. We did have breakfast included in our package but didn’t receive our vouchers until the last night they was pushed under our door so can’t comment on breakfast as we didn’t have it . The location of this hotel is perfect . I would stay here again for the location . Do not stay here! There are bed bugs and the housekeeping staff are not interested. I’d seen reviews about peeling wallpaper and leaking showers, but I think I’d have coped with that.  My son and myself were both bitten, with my son’s legs covered in bites! On first glance, the room looked ok, although in need of some updating, but closer inspection showed that it didn’t get cleaned properly.  The bathroom was probably the only reasonable part of the room! The room tax was $50 per night, which for the standard of accommodation is exorbitant.  I definitely wouldn’t recommend staying here, even though it’s in a great location  I suffer from fibromyalgia and neuropathy and I needed a hot bath and the water wasn’t heating up fast enough it was like 3AM an I went downstairs an Adam was amazing he offered to move me rooms and send someone to get my bags I decided not to move an Just wait for the water to heat up. Adam is sweet an friendly Just came back from staying here. Amazing location. Basic & outdated  rooms however not the end of the world. Breakfast was like a tuck shop.   Had a mostly very pleasant experience here with great staff however one bad experience with a particular staff member Josephine on reception left a very bitter taste. Sarcastic, belittling and condescending. It is somewhat outdated in rooms, breakfast is grab and go no real restaurant For location, ok, because work was in area and at price point hard to find decent hotel but would rather stay in hotel system that had membership in (ie Bonvoy, IHG) and use points if pricey for vacation trip Downstairs as you enter was lovely as are the staff. Location is great too but do not believe the photos of rooms on the website. I think they may be the executive rooms. Our room was only surface dusted. Plenty more could be found. Rops/marks on the wallpaper. Plug socket falling out of the wall. Bath had large crack and was covered in marks. Carpets wrinkly.  I did see another review saying they could imagine the kid on the bike from the shining pedalling these corridors, can\\'t disagree. Overall very tired and worn. Needs a total freshen up'},\n",

We were told by the front desk that we had 18 dollars food credit per person each day and plus 35 dollars per day for giving up extra honors points. So the lady in the front desk wrote \\'71 dollars credit per day\\' to our key holder. Thats why we spent that amount with breakfast (which didn\\'t even worth 45$ per person. Worst breakfast I have ever had in a Hilton brand hotel)  Anyway I did my checkout thru mobile app and dropped the keys and left. Afterwards when I checked my receipt I saw that I only got 35 dollars for credit instead of 71$ which dissapointed me and I got in touch with an agent thru app to create a case.  Hotel changed my receipt and I was told that I will receive total of 72 I was very pleased with my stay at the Hilton Times Square.  First off, the location is perfect, right off of Times Square as well as the subway connection there is perfect to be able to to anywhere in the city.  So this hits all the points for location.  Next, the Hotel rooms, spacious, well appointed and on floors 22 -44, so great views, particularly on the upper floors.  I was on floor 36 with a great view south, Empire state building right outside my window.  Staff, all great, respectful and were always glad to assist; great team.  I was recognized as a Diamond member; check. The only downside was the price of a full breakfast; 50 USD (plus tax).  that I find a bit pricey, but the only minus point.  I fully recommend staying here. I visited this hotel back in 2014 and was blown away. It was clean, stylish, luxurious and the staff made you feel like you were a valued guest. This is not how my recent experience went. I travelled with my husband and two year old son. As you can imagine, when travelling with small children you would have more luggage ie a travel cot and a case for my son as well as his stroller. When we entered the area prior to taking the lift to reception (whilst my husband and I struggled with our bags, not one of the bell boys asked if we needed a hand. Instead they watched as we struggled which put me off straight away. A fellow guest offered to help instead. On check out again we had an issue with our bags and this time I called to ask the bell boys for help and they advised me they Amazing stay! The room was way bigger than we could have imagined and was well equipped, clean, very friendly and helpful staff (except one miserable woman on front desk). The hotel is a dream being so perfectly located, and there\\'s a nice social buzz at the bar. Would definitely recommend staying here. We checked into the Hilton Hotel at 1.30 pm and had already been told about an early check in fee of $50.00 if you arrive early as rooms aren\\'t supposed to be ready until 4pm so decided to pay this as not to hang around waiting. Our room was really nice on the 24th floor with a nice view spotlessly clean with 2 Queen size beds and a massive TV and fridge in our room.   We could not fault the service of the staff at The Hilton Times Square although we didn\\'t speak to many of them , the gentleman serving in the convenience shop in the hotel was delightful and so helpful.   As far as we are concerned I would definitely recommend The Hilton Times Square the location was absolutely perfect really close to everything most places were within walking distance and the subways only a few First time in New York & chose this hotel due to location - Times Square, Rockerfeller centre all a short walk away. Travelled as a family of 2 adults & 1 teen so booked the 2 x double beds room - as this trip was for our 25th wedding anniversary I emailed ahead & requested a high room with a view if possible. At check-in we had been upgraded to a corner room on the 34th floor - amazing views! The room was spacious & clean & yes, the bathroom could do with updating but it was fit for purpose. We had housekeeping everyday including clean towels. There is a daily resort fee of €30 however you are given €30 credit each day to spend in the hotel - the fresh pastries & breakfast bagels in the Herb & Kitchen restaurant were delicious & were ideal to grab along with fresh coffee before I used to look at Hilton hotels as one of the leading hotels for quality and customer service in the industry but after this stay I will choose any hotel chain besides Hilton.  I called Hilton to book our rooms as I needed connecting rooms and was told it was all set and given the price.  The night before travel I was notified for early check in on the Honors App and when I went to check in it showed three rooms and none of them were connecting.  I tried to call the hotel 4 times and never got an answer.  I then reached out to Hilton Honors and they could not reach the hotel either.  Finally reached the hotel through chat and they said they did not offer connecting rooms even though they saw that in my reservation.  After quite a bit of discussion they finally came back on the Very bad experience. Bad breakfast, rude people At the front desk, also have charges of 5 dollars a bag to store when you check out. Horrible rooms.  Very old. Good location. But not worth the experience for the price. The guy at the bar is the only fellow who smiled and spoke. Rest of the staff were almost unhappy to be there. We had such a wonderful stay! The room was spotless, the staff was amazing and the amenities and views could not be beat! We visited the week before Christmas so the Hilton was the perfect escape from the crowds. Highly recommend! The city is extra busy during Christmas and Ciro Alarcon makes you feel like you are the only one in the restaurant. I am flattered by his attention.   More people should be as kind as this man.   Thank you Ciro.  Ciro Alarcon was amazing with his great service and pleasant attitude. We enjoyed the attention and service. It was very busy and he made certain that we were taken care of in every way.   My husband was five weeks out of chemotherapy and radiation and unable to eat much. Ciro bent over backwards to see to it that he was taken care of.   Much appreciation to Ciro Alarcon for his excellence in service.   He made our visit very special. Great location with terrific staff and great amenities! Rooms were incredibly clean with stellar views. The staff was polite, professional and very helpful. Even with it being directly in Times Square it felt like you really escaped the hustle and bustle of everything when you entered the hotel (which was needed at times!) The interior of the hotel was beautiful and impeccably clean. Staff was friendly, accommodating and helpful. The rooms are modern and comfortable. We had food and drink at the hotel and both were fabulous! Would highly recommend this location for a one-of-a-kind Times Square stay! We chose this hotel due to other positive reviews and that we could book connecting rooms. Sadly, both were inaccurate. We landed in NYC to find our booked and selected via the app connecting rooms were no longer connected. We were traveling with 2 young boys and chose Hilton as it allows booking rooms as such. We called the hotel, the manager said he would call us back in 5-10 minutes. We never heard back. 50 minutes later when we arrived at the hotel, we waited in line and then waited another 20 minutes at the desk while they tried to figure out which rooms to give us. We ended up with two rooms on the same floor but not connecting. So, one parent with one child vs a more family friendly stay. The lobby is nice, Stephanie at the front desk was helpful. The rooms are run down: Hotel is situated in a great location.  We went to NY to see the Rockettes  About a 15 minute walk to radio city.  Another two minute walk to Rockefeller Center.  Hotel was clean and room was quiet.  Went to the front desk to ask where the business center was to print off our boarding passes for our flight home.  Was told “we don’t have a business center, use the app on your phone.” Raquel was very rude and not helpful.  I stated” a Hilton without a business area”. Raquel said “we just re-opened two years ago and it is being remodeled.”  It takes 2 years to put up two computers and a printer. Breakfast was $45 for a buffet.  If you can wait till 8am Applebees is on the street level. Dunkin’ Donuts close by at 6 am.  Victor Gotay at The Market is the best. He went above and beyond to accommodate two different food allergies we have. This is rare these days. The dining staff were very friendly as well. The hotel is decorated very festive for Christmas.  Clean room ,clean restrooms,  the food was good and the staff nice and respectful . The  stay was welcoming- we will definitely return here once more ! The staff helped us book a musical and a dinner for a birthday occasion I appreciate everyone here for welcoming us from California Enjoyed the stay.  Staying in Time Square is very much advised especially if you wanna feel the real spirit of NYC.  The hotel staff was very jovial and respectful. The warm service of Ciro and Jose at the restaurant was one of a kind.  I would like to acknowledge the five stars service provided by the Runner Ciro Alarcon at our breakfasts during the whole week at this Hilton. He always guided us promptly to a good table and offered nice treats. That service is key for our return to this Hilton in the future. The worst ever reception staff both day and night I have faced in my life. They were rude unhelpful & ignorant. The calls made multiple times from the room to the reception or any area of the hotel were never answered. The house keeping staff always forgot to clean the room although we inform at the reception. Hilton times square is home away from home. Go for the high floors bedroom with south view, you won\\'t regret it! But my favorite thing is the staff. Stefanie at the front desk, and of course Gazi and Francisco for the morning coffee and breakfast. Not mentioning the team at the bar, the cleaners. Everybody is amazing. Thank you!  Do you enjoy paying for random and hidden fee\\'s or predatory pricing similar to those of ultra low cost, de-bundled style airlines? Come stay at the Hilton Times Square in NYC and enjoy $21 coffee!!!  Four of us stayed at this Hilton for a single evening, sharing a room for a quick, impromptu trip to NYC from SoCal, having paid four hundred dollars for the single Tuesday evening. Across the dozens of Hilton properties across different states, countries and continents, this Hilton is a lot like the gum on your shoe. You don\\'t see it, but once you step on it, you just got to deal with it.  Let\\'s start with the fee\\'s. Some are published, most are not: - Early Check-In, $50 - Late Check-Out, $50 - Luggage Storage, $5 per bag each time. - $35, per day, per room charge/fee but you can Thanks ciro for helping us. Very helpfull. Great experince staying hilton times square. Food very good. Room very clean. Nice environment. Very2 helpfull staff. Cashback with 35dollar everyday that i can choose from convenience store Foods was good.  Thanks Ciro Alarcon. Very helpfull and friendly... Recommended to others.  The team all very nice. The grocery shop was good. Provide us with fruits everyday .  Very nice place to stay. Hotel is good and over expectatation. The food for breakfast is good and some is halal. The waitress Mr. Ciro very helpfull and commenddable. I will recommend this hotel to other person and will come again in future. See you Hilton and see you New York City.  The view from our room was fabulous, and the staff was competent and pleasant.  However, there were several issues:  The thermostat could not be adjusted high enough to be comfortable, and we were chilly most of the time.  There was no end table or coffee table near the sofa to place a drink or anything else.  The room needed repainting, as there were many chips and scrapes, especially in the bathroom.  No room key card was required to use the elevators, which was a security concern.  Anyone off the streets could freely travel up and down the elevators.  In fact, late one night a man banged on the door to our room, demanding that I open the door.  I told him to go away, but he continued to knock for several minutes.  This was rather unnerving. Let me just start off by saying Flakron and Ciro are the best workers I’ve ever came across. I’ve been to many hotels and I’ve never felt more at home. They made sure we all felt comfortable and had everything we needed. I’d definitely come back After reading previous reviews, I was worried about a couple of things when staying at this hotel.  The first was a musty odor mentioned several times in the reviews and the second was the worn furniture, carpet, etc...  I was pleasantly surprised when I entered my room to find no odors and the room seemed to be updated.  Elevators were fast, never waited longer than a minute or two. I used the $35  daily credit towards snacks and drinks daily from the store onsite. It\\'s handy to have snacks while walking around the city.  I stayed in a Studio King Corner with Sofabed. Be advised, that this specific room category does not have two walls of windows.  it is simply a larger King room with a sofa bed that is located on the corner of a building.  These room types overlook the Empire Flakron was super nice and accommodating. There was about five mins left to breakfast because we came down late and he was super quick to get our orders within the time. I would definitely go back!!!! The room itself was great and comfortable even though it seemed like there were some minor room blemishes when I got there like the wall/ door in the bathroom and things like that but nothing too crazy. The people above me were super loud, the walls were THIN. People on my floor were fine. However I don\\'t understand how I could hear people coughing above me. I checked out but the hotel not only hasn\\'t returned my deposit hold, but charged me 103.43 which hasn\\'t been returned to me. And have not even said what it\\'s for. I didn\\'t damage anything so not sure what the problem is. And trying to get in touch with this hotel is IMPOSSIBLE. I left a voicemail or two. No reply. Emailed a few times. No reply. My best luck at reaching anyone is support on chat or phone support where they Poor communication, lack of transparency and out of pocket.   Hotel room was clean and had everything needed. Windows were dirty so poor view from window.   Told on check-in that we had a complimentary $35/night to spend at the hotel whether at their bar, restaurant or marketplace - asked for clarification as had not booked this and wanted to make sure that this was legit, apparently so. No upfront payment of “resort fee” which is also unusual or any mention of it. Spent slightly over the limit one night so when checking out (final bill not posted to room) so wanted to finalise bill and pay outstanding balance prior to leaving. Rude worker told us to just post key in the card drop as we wouldn’t be seen to and that our bill would be emailed to us. Over a week from our departure Ah Bab was such a wonderful bartender.  He was always ready to pour and his drinks were perfect.  We had the Old Fashion, the Espresso Martini, and the Manhattan.  Be sure and ask for him when you come!! We have just spent a fantastic stay at the hotel for our anniversary.  The hotel is close to Time Square and all the shows on broadway.  The hotel is clean and the staff friendly always checking with you that your stay with them is ok.  The rooms are large with views of the city, there is tea and coffee making facilities and large tv in the room.  We paid for breakfast which was plentiful and good quality.  Would we recommend this hotel yes we would, would we stay here again yes we would Stayed for 1 night for business meeting in midtown. Lobby was nice but rooms very dated and in need of refurb.  Check in was uninspiring - diamond member and no recognition. $18 credit offered - didn’t even cover the cost of 1 drink, which when you’re paying nearly $500 for a room is disappointing.  Room did have great view of Empire State Building and beyond. Scam avoid this place at ALL costs if you can Tired dated smelly and dirty. Recently I believe this sham was taken over by another manager or owner I\\'m not sure. BUT this was a hotel booked as a package. So all was, prepaid prior to arrival. When we arrived to check in we were informed that we were being charged a destination \"fee\" Of $35 Or a resort fee! A resort fee for what a pool? No Parking No So what amenities am I actually being charged for? After a quick google search I found that this fee\" was actually not really a legal requirement there’s a grey area and the people in charge are trying to get this banned (people of the government) BUT they force you into paying it or no room. Then they dress it up as some resort credit. Basically loose it or use it. So basically you Days before arrival I was offered a paid upgrade. Upon checkin, same upgrades available, none given. Hyatt always upgrades before even checking in.  Giving up on Hilton as being a Diamond member gives you little to no satisfaction The best thing to say about this hotel is that the rooms are strangely large especially by New York City standards--I did not expect that from a Times Square hotel.  That said, it\\'s loud and the room itself is pretty sparing: moderately comfortable bed; Crabtree and Evelyn \"awake\" bathroom amenities (with bottles locked to the shower / sink areas); no robe and pretty threadbare towels.  But at least the room was quiet from hallway noise (and it was a corner room, which was nice), though one could still hear the streets below even above the 30th floor (it\\'s NYC, I get it).    Check-in was quick--digital key does not work on the elevators, but at least I could check in early and chose a room at the end of the hall which was great.  Check-out was easy and fast even at 3.30am.   The staff at this Hilton are phenomenal in particular the breakfast and lobby bar. Very customer focused!! I would highly recommend selecting this hotel for your next visit to  New York City. Nothing like being in the heart of Time Square I had dark brown water running from the tap in my bathroom. It was absolutely disgusting, the color of sewer water! I have videos and pictures. I went to the front desk immediately and showed the clerk the videos and pictures. She was not all that friendly, and didn’t even apologize at first! She then said her manager was in a meeting and would contact me. We left the hotel, later that day the manager, called to tell me it was a “routine issue” that there was a boiler shutdown. I was appalled that I had paid for a higher end hotel, travelled to another country, and was told brown water is a routine issue! I spent 2 weeks in Portugal this summer, have been on 5 different vacations this year alone and have NEVER seen this in a hotel. He then offered to credit all bar/store charges This location felt like a complete scam. We arrived at 1:15pm for check in and were told the room is ready but only at a USD $50 charge. Being Canadian and already having spent USD $396/night, we were not keen on spending more. We were told by the guy that we should have booked the room the night before (at USD $350) to ensure we got early check in or pay the USD $50.   This made no sense and I wished he stopped talking. We were told it\\'s hotel policy for early check-ins. This was a first for me - I have travelled to 32 countries and have not experienced this and there is no information about this additional cost in their policy documents or website. We were told the room is ready but you can\\'t check in unless you pay or you can wait 2 hours. Also, our room was not a king size'},\n",

Bed is comfortable though very low to the ground. Trendy opaque glass between bathrooms and bed... not great for more than one person. And the low ambient lighting sucks.  Staying at Dream is like when you meet someone trying way too hard to be cool.  However, more importantly, if you book via Expedia or whatever, you will find that you have a nightly destination fee of $57.  When you ask for an explanation, the person at the desk will search his or her mental index for reasons, including \"the pool\" in the middle of winter.  One last point is the internet connection sucks. The check-in staff was so great and very courteous, he made sure my stay was comfortable and enjoyable.  The location is unbeatable. I stayed in January, the pool in the courtyard would be amazing in the summer.   The hotel is very clean and quiet. It is very close to the city center and can be walked. It is also very close to the subway station. I will choose you again next time I travel to New York. The staff is also very enthusiastic and professional. It is great and worth recommending. All of the staff were super friendly. It was easy to find the hotel and parking was available across the street. Check in was quick. We also stayed for their New Year\\'s party where we were treated like royalty. They were attentive to us for the whole night. Our room was clean and comfortable. It was a nice modern setting. The bathroom was good sized with a big shower area too. I would definitely stay here again We arrived early and were able to pre-check in and store our bags, however, when we returned there was a fairly long line at the front desk and only one person working behind it. The public spaces are clean and well maintained. Our room (double queen) was larger than expected for NYC. The bedding and bathroom were clean, however the carpet looked like it hasn’t been updated in a decade. It was seriously almost worn through in the high traffic areas. It made us wonder how and when it was last cleaned. Carpeting in the hallways are also worn, torn and frayed. A request for extra pillows was fulfilled quickly by a friendly staff member. The extra pillows were much better than the ones in the room – fluffier and firmer. Mattresses were very soft (good for me, meh for my girlfriend). I would have liked this hotel a lot better if they discussed ameneties with me during check in. I see there\\'s a pool in the picture? But I wasn\\'t told about that.   The good:  Nice location Seems to have an interesting restaurant Nice bar  The bad:  Cold water showers. Absolutely no hot water during any shower in the four days we stayed. A group of people partied from 1-6am on our floor. I called the front desk who \"sent up security\" - party still didn\\'t wind down until 6 am. No cups for water? No coffee? Nothing in your room? Weird buttons that control the lighting - most of which barely worked. Not user friendly.  Great addition to the Hyatt brand, Dream Downtown is in an excellent location within Chelsea Meatpacking District. Super close to Hudson Yards and the village. My room was a balcony king room which was worth the extra for the space and outdoor area. TAO Downtown and Philippe Chow is around the corner. PHD is amazing with the rooftop views. Excellent coffee at Natura Cafe (Brenda is the BEST). Definitely returning.  Refrigerator was broken. The shower valve would not maintain temperature, had to continuously adjust. It was either hot or cold. Storage for clothes was one small drawer and very small hanging bar. The mattress was beyond crappy, all springs and noisy. Unbelievable that any hotel would have this bad of a mattress. The TV signal would freeze every one to two minutes for 5 seconds, made watching football really frustrating. The room is very small. The view of the pool.... Skip this room. The view also includes the other side of hotel, so no view. Balcony is small chair wide by 6 feet long.  We couldn\\'t believe the view of the city we had from our room when we arrived! It was spectacular. The room was cute and clean and in a great location. From the hotel we walked everywhere and had access to everything we needed in a short radius. The Chelsea Market is right across the street which has so many great food and shopping options! We were within minutes of great breakfast and coffee spots we found as well, and we had so much fun just exploring Chelsea. We walked down to the waterfront and enjoyed the High Line, all just a short walk from the hotel - and for such an incredible price compared to other hotels we were looking at. We paid WAY more at another hotel later with no where near as good as of an experience as we had here at Dream. It\\'s such a great value! We would The Dream Downtown is steps from everything that Chelsea, Meatpacking and the West Village have to offer. There are few good hotel options in this highly desirable, residential part of town and the Dream is hands-down the best. Clean, comfortable rooms, good design and excellent service (especially Anthony at the front desk!) make the Dream a no-brainer. We\\'ll be back! I attended the hotel for a work meeting. It was very fun and modern. Everyone seemed very nice. It was a very short visit so I cannot comment on the food at all. We had a dinner out somewhere else as well as breakfast. Location was perfect for what we needed near the Fig and Olive and Chelsea Piers. The staff at Dream Downtown are incredibly rude and have little to none customer service. Do not stay at this hotel if you would like a friendly, warm atmosphere as you will be sorely disappointed. Upon check in, the lady barely looked at us. Anytime we asked for extra towels or why our room had not been cleaned, we were greeted with hostility and a sour attitude. We spent as little time as possible in this hotel and will not be returning.  WOW what a great hotel and above and beyond service, will defiantly Stay again thank you Ester for helping me out for this stay and many more to come, Great Location, close to trains and very clean hotel  The property is in a good location, and it is kind of a cool vibe, but that is the end of the good part of our stay at this hotel . We booked a higher end large king room with a view on a higher floor spending over $900 A NIGHT.  We stayed for 4 nights, nights 1 and 2 were great, but night 3, Wednesday the nightclub at the hotel opened and we were WOKEN AND THEN UNABLE TO SLEEP FOR TWO NIGHTS IN ROW. Night 3 we beared through the pounding as we didn\\'t need to wake up so early, but night 4 we were very tired AND NEEDED TO WAKE BY 5CLUB WOULD PLAY MUSIC UNTIL 4AM that night !!  They gave us another room at 12:30AM TO THE 7TH FLOOR BUT THE THUMPING COULD STILL BE HEARD.  This place ended in a flop, and we will never stay here again. We are fighting to get some portion of our stay When you spend a substantial amount on a luxurious hotel stay, you expect a certain level of satisfaction and service. However, this hotel disappoints greatly in that aspect. The manners of the staff, particularly the receptionists, are appalling. The lobby, which transforms into a nightclub, exacerbates the situation, leading to an unwelcoming atmosphere akin to that of encountering nightclub bouncers. The hotel is just short cab right away from everything. The hotel staff has been very friendly. Our thanks to Esther Song for setting up the room and the amenities. I would highly recommend this hotel. The room is clean and tidy. The bathroom is large. The lighting is good. There is an excellent security system for do not disturb and made service. What a terrible hotel and customer service.  Apart from generally a poor hotel, they hosted two hiddeous \\'events\\' directly under our room that meant the entire hotel throbbed and shook until 4 am 2 nights in a row. This was not the club, which we knew about (and carefully booked a room to be away from) but additional events.    Obviously we complained and were slightly pacified when they said they would refund those 2 nights (we stayed a total of 8 - and honestly most of the trip was ruined because we were wall eyed zombies and thoroughly miserable from no sleep).  But now they are refusing to make that refund!  We have been battling for 2 months via expedia - initially they claimed they\\'d refunded but hadn\\'t, then they finally refunded 10% of those nights.  It\\'s so disgusting - This is a beautiful, hip hotel in Chelsea but what you don’t know before you come is that there is a club that plays music into the early morning hours every single night. You hear the music & vibrating bass all night & some of the of the hotel goers come home from whatever bar/club & talk loudly down the hallways going back to their room. This will be my 3rd night here & I haven’t gotten any sleep on this entire vacation. Worst part is, you need all the energy to walk miles & miles throughout the day in NY & with no sleep it completely ruins your energy level to enjoy the city. I’ll never stay here again. The hotel was beautiful and a good location. Staff was friendly and informative! We came for the Thanksgiving parade and some shopping and the location was perfect ! Good location to restaurants and lots of site seeing! Is a beautiful hotel, well located in Chelsea area, all we needed. Does not include breakfast but there are some options near by. I would like to have better lighting in the room, mostly for doing my makeup. You have infront the Chelsea market and the highline.  The front desk staff were nice enough to warn us of the music from the rooftop dance club and suggest that we move from our 11th floor reservation down to the 9th floor. However, the music was still loud enough to keep us awake (mainly the bass frequencies). The club is loudest from 1am - 4am. Suggest staying on a lower floor if you’re sensitive to noise or a light sleeper … u less you’re a night owl in which case it won’t matter! We were traveling with a toddler so it wasn’t ideal. But the room was beautiful, the hotel is super cool and the staff were amazing. Fantastic location.  While clean and very modern, the Dream was too much of a boutique hotel for anyone over 65. The bed was VERY low to the ground, no towel racks or hooks in bathroom, large porthole window required a heavy curtain that you had to pull over the couch, in front of the window, to insure privacy making the couch useless. It may be a very nice hotel for a younger, trendy customer but not a Dream for us.  Conveniently located. A good variety of places to eat and shopping nearby. Staff is professional and go out of their way to assist. Rooms are spacious, extremely clean, comfortable, and quiet.  Pool area way closed for the season, but it looked very nice.  Amazing hotel with easy check-in, friendly staff, awesome rooftop bar/lounge. Can\\'t beat the location. Would definitely stay here again. Room was clean and efficient for the amount of space. Hotel bar opens at 5.  I booked my 5 nights stay through AMEX corporate travel and was surprised to be told that it is not eligible for Hyatt points. Usually corporate travel bookings are always eligible at other chains. So after spending $3K for the stay, I came away with 0 points. I would not have booked this if I had known, and will avoid for future business trips.  The hotel is also not very well designed and maintained. My towel rack was half broken and unstable. The shower curtain is this metal mesh material that is both hard to manoeuvre and terrible for shower since it is harsh and cold on your body if you accidentally come in contact with it. The noise insulation was not good especially for a hotel with a nightclub attached.  Stay somewhere else is my recommendation.  Enjoyable stay. Nice view. Good desk staff made check in/out very painless. Only complaint was that the bed was a bit uncomfortable though. Definitely would stay here again though.   …………….:…………:.::.::. To the \"DREAM TEAM\" :  As often as I travel, the last thing I need is to have an unpleasant lodging experience at the hotel I\\'m staying with. My team and I had to make a last minute decision to stay at The Dream Hotel in Chelsea. Where as we were accustomed to staying at some of the other formidable competitors. TOTAL GAME CHANGER!  The entire staff took great pride in executing their rolls with excellence. On the day of our check out, I wanted to make a point to speak with a manager and that\\'s when I met Randy! Good dude! I see where some draw inspiration in regards to taking pride in their jobs. I simply wanted to commend them on such a great job. I wanted to remark on the exquisite job Maria does while on her post. Not only was she amazing with us but I had moments to observe I will stay here again on business because it was so convenient, but I will not choose it for personal travel because the room was cheaply put together. The AC clanked, so I had to turn it off. The drawer broke. There were not outlets on both sides of the bed. It just felt cheap, sadly.  The rooms have basically no noise isolation. I could here everything happening outside my room. From waking up at 6am one day because the couple in the room next door was arguing to staying up until 12:30am the next day because my other \"neighbor\" was having a conversation over the phone with a friend (who I could also hear over their speaker phone) We paid for a silver room but received a bronze room. The shower set up wasn\\'t ideal because the shower head hose was constantly in the spray of water. The light switch by the head of the bed is constantly lit so we had to cover it up with a towel while we slept. The beds are very low platform beds so if you have a hard time getting up this might not be the one for you.  I stayed at the Dream Downtown for 1 night this week. Initially my Internet in the room did not work. And my phone service was not working in the room. Later this was fixed. The fire alarm went off at 6am. And I could not hear the PA announcements in my room. I had to dress and go down to the lobby for information as to MY SAFETY. And then my shower had no hot water. None. When I later asked at the desk on my way out she said, \"They were supposed to turn it on at 4am. I don\\'t know what happened.\" 2023, New York City, no hot water? TLDR: overpriced for super small rooms. There are much more affordable hotels with nicer ameneties within a few blocks. Go to one of those.  This place used to be the spot 10 years ago, but now it stands boldly un-updated, deteriorating on the coattails of its former glory. The rooms are very small and poorly lit. I was using my phone flash to find things. There are 6 buttons for 2 lights, but only 2/6 do anything. The button labels have worn off with age. The bathroom door is hefty, like mean hefty, and the bathroom walls are transparent -- thankfully, because the light spills into the darkness of the bedroom, helping to compensate. When I asked the front desk person via the telephone in the room for a food recommendation, he said he didn\\'t know. I later discovered the hotel Overall, it\\'s a place to sleep. However for the price we pay and the lack of amenities(no great place to work outside of your room), privacy (thin walls, club entrance in the lobby, etc.) I would consider staying elsewhere in the future especially if you\\'re visiting for work. The hotel isn\\'t the best for extended stays. Better for a weekend getaway to party in NY versus a professional hotel where you can have a comfortable place to work, etc. I will say the staff were friendly and did the best they could!  The overall experience of the hotel would be much better without the rooftop hotel. I was 3 floors down from the club and I could not fall asleep because of the music until 3am. That was on a Wednesday! Completely unacceptable and should be disclosed ahead of time. Overall experience was great. Easy to check in and out, staff was very friendly. And the rooms were cozy... Stayed here for a work trip. The hotel has several restaurants within feet which was a plus. It is also very close to 2 Starbucks and that is a must when I travel! Though they have a great cafe connected to the lobby. Amazing hotel Best location  Room was big and great. Bathroom was very nice and big. At the hotel is a small coffee shop and nearby is Chelsea Market.  Close to the metro, blue and red lines.  Even the price was reasonable  I shared my many complaints with the front desk.  The staff at the front desk couldn\\'t find me when checking in, even though the reservation was made through my corporate travel agency.  I was there for 30 minutes and had to reschedule a meeting.  The room was rather dirty, had no trash bin, a TV service that wasn\\'t working (even though I called ahead of my trip to ensure it was as it was essential to prepare a presentation on a big screen), and old TV and barely working remote.    I was on the 3rd floor and the music was so loud I couldn\\'t sleep.  I asked for water and ice and never received it.  It\\'s like I was screaming into the wind.  I asked for washcloths (the weren\\'t restocked) and never got them.  I came back on day 3 of my stay to a rollaway bed (even though I was I stayed here for a work trip for 8 nights. The mattress was very springy and uncomfortable. The front desk staff was helpful, but not friendly. It’s really hard to find water in the hotel so I would recommend bringing bottles water with you for your stay. The room is primarily metal and concrete, so if you’re looking to feel at home, this isn’t the right hotel for you.  Nightclub on 12th floor was open until 4AM and music was so loud it pounded through my 11th floor room. Staff did NOT inform me of the club when I arrived and didn’t seem to care about my complaint (“Hotel is full. Sorry, can’t change room.”)'},\n",

The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance of Broadway shows, restaurants, Times Square and subway stations.  The staff was welcoming and accommodating.  The lobby is very nice and doors are locked - no entry without a hotel key, which made us feel very safe.  The rooms were clean and roomy for New York with a small refrigerator for our use.  Very nice benefit was having a hot breakfast each day from 7:00 am - 10:00 a.m.  Would definitely stay here again! Myself and my 2 sisters stayed at this hotel mid December and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Room was really spacious with 2 large beds,the room was cleaned every day and we had fresh towels every day too. Hotel staff were lovely and friendly. Lovely clean hotel and very quiet area which was good when sleeping. Breakfast was good which set us up for the day and a good variety. Walking distance to Grand central Empire State Building TOTR Bryant park  and Macey’s  such a great location. I would highly recommend!! This hotel was what we expected from a Hampton Inn - clean room, basic amenities (soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, coffee/tea), and decent breakfast (cheese omelette, sausage, potatoes, yogurt, fruit, bagels, cereals, waffles, coffee & juices). The location can’t be beat - 41st street and 7th Avenue - just a couple blocks from the heart of Times Square! We had 10 minute walks to Broadway theaters and Bryant Park, and 15 minute walks to Grand Central Station and Radio City Music Hall. We were disappointed not to have a fridge in our room - so our leftovers were bad by morning. This was the main reason not to give 5 stars. Make sure to visit the roof (R in the elevator) for a wonderful view of the city. Great place to stay with free breakfast included. Conveniently located- able to walk to many places from here. Staff lovely. 2 huge comfy beds with good pillows. A shallow bath and shower with great hairdryer. A little shop and coffee area in lobby for snacks. There is a lounging area in lobby and small rooftop access open until 8.30. Great value Perfect location and so easy to get to all parts of the city and many of the main tourist attractions.  We felt safe during our visit. Checking and everyone at the desk desl were great, the breakfast far exceeded our expectation and the people helping and taking care of everyone were outstanding. Our room was a little on the small side - hello New York but was clean and we always had what we need for our stay.  Met with Karen and discussed Hilton Rewards options. She is wonderful and was great with our family, especially our kids!   Lloyd was great at check in and so helpful, just friendly and welcoming!   Hotel was great for our stay and nearby everything.  Amazing hotel with a great price and location! Blocks away from Times Square! Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Great for families, friends or a business trip. Definitely would recommend to anyone traveling to New York City. Would stay here again! This Hampton Inn is a great find! Clean, quiet, FANTASTIC roof views and wonderful location! Next door to the Nederlander theater & less than 5 minute walk to Times Square, Bryant Park & the Subway.  A continental style breakfast is included which allowed a fast start to our day. The real gem of this hotel is the staff! They became family in just a couple of days! If something isn’t to your liking, just ASK! From the smiles of the front desk staff (Kiefer, Lizbeth, Joshua, James to name a few), Stephania our floor’s housekeeper & of course, Eddie, the bellman/concierge who can get you a car service, directions on how to navigate the Subway or walk to Macy’s with equal ease, the staff  made our visit easy & memorable! We can’t wait to go back. Thanks to Shane (and Eddie) for starting our trip off in such a helpful, fun, stress-free way! I was greeted with a smile and Shane went above and behind to ensure our requests were met to make our trip memorable! Staff was friendly, especially our breakfast attendants—felt safe, secure and looked after! Will definitely visit again—great location!  I had a problem at my house that prevented us from staying there, Booked a room at 6:30 PM (Handicap for wife) Put us in a room for the night and changed rooms the next day, Total 3 night stay.  Special shout out to Kimberley who went far beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable.  The price is too high for the service provided. Only good things about this hotel: location and cleanliness. Breakfast is terrible. no cheese or ham. Boiled eggs are icy and very overcooked. The breakfast room is small, about 50-60 seats, and the hotel is on the 31st floor. You have to wait up to 30 minutes to be seated, some eat at the reception. There are too few elevators, because going down from 7:30 to 9 in the morning you may have to wait for the elevator for 20-30 minutes. The windows in the room are leaky, so there is noise from the air conditioners of the buildings here around, making it impossible to sleep. The room is cool and the heater is so loud it's hard to have a conversation. We asked to change the room, they refused. Great location. We were able to walk to many places. Multiple subway stations and restaurants are nearby. The hotel was very clean, and the lobby was decorated for the holidays. We each received a free bottle of water at check in. Breakfast was good and the ladies who work the breakfast area kept it well stocked. Everyone at the hotel was very kind; The manager saw us sitting in the lobby and introduced himself. I would recommend. Terrible experience (and I am a Hilton Honors Diamond member!)  Called around to find a room with two queen beds + sleeper sofa for party of 3, two being seven-foot basketball players.  Made reservation with Hilton Honors 800 number for room as specified.  Got to hotel and there are NO SUCH ROOMS at this property. The manager was totally uninterested in helping us (again; HHonors Diamond). First night was so bad (two of us in one queen bed and the sever-footer awoke with terrible back pains that we canceled the second night of reservation. It took FOUR months and countless emails on my part to get the 80,000 points returned to my account. Asked for additional points for how we got screwed but Hilton not interested in making such a gesture to a loyal guest.  The kicker: I got 2-3 Stayed here in August 2023. Chose this hotel because I had tickets to see Some Like It Hot on Broadway and have Hilton Honors. Staff were friendly. Nice clean lobby. Never felt unsafe. Stayed on the 8th floor and hardly heard any city noise considering I was super close to Times Square and Port Authority. I had a king room and for a NYC hotel didn't feel cramped but same time not too big either. Just perfect. Nice comfortable bed and air conditioning was very nice. I just got back from a business trip to NYC. Being business, my schedule was a bit tighter than a leisurely trip. I needed help with my accommodations and Shane and Lisbeth were so helpful. They turned a stressful situation into a great experience. All of my needs were met and they really exceeded expectations. This will be my new “go to” hotel because of Lisbeth and Shane! We have stayed at this property multiple times over the past decade.  So when we arrived this time, we were surprised to find that the hotel had been refurbished.  And this change was not for the better.  Rooms are significantly smaller.  In fact, the King size rooms are just big enough for one person to walk around the bed.  There are small shelves on each side of the bed,  one shelf below the window, and a few small shelves next to the window.  This means there is very little room for comfort much less luggage.  The bathroom open area is big enough to turn around in.    The breakfast area has been reduced and is no where large enough to accommodate the large crowds coming and going for breakfast and offers very few seating options. The water dispensers were empty all morning.  Karen was AWESOME! I arrived on a whim and she greeted me in the lobby. Kind, courteous, beyond friendly and she informed me of offers and deals for which i was eligible. She is definitely a bright spot in this location.  It was a nice stay in this Hotel, rooms clean and God thank you for the coffee in the lobby, Karen is an amazing employee and so charmin’. Five star experience here and continue to give this type of attention to the guests!  Despite some negative reviews we had a great stay at this hotel. Clean room with comfy beds (every day clean towels and beds made). The breakfast buffet was good and sufficient but more fruit and fresh yoghurt would make it even better. Other hotel facilities are basic but clean. Staff is friendly. Good Wifi. Times Square is just around the corner but not causing any noise (but we had a room on 24th floor). A lot is accessible on foot. Good connections to bus and metro. Overall I was happy with my stay here. The hotel  is in a great location if you’re planning to see some shows. My room was spotless and the staff was very friendly, particularly in the breakfast room. I do wish they had more space for people to sit at breakfast as it got very crowded. I also got a good deal of street noise coming in, even though I was on the 21st floor. I know, it’s NYC, but I’ve been in other Times Square hotels and the rooms seemed better insulated from street noise. Maybe the Hilton needs to invest in some better window glass! I also wished my room had a refrigerator. My stay itself was good.  The location was convenient and the room was nice and clean. The reason my rating is not higher is that the congestion when using the elevators detracted from our trip. Only 3 elevators for a hotel that holds that many people is not a good plan.  Long lines would form when trying to go up or down.  We had to allow extra time to come and go from the hotel for this reason.  Also, the congestion in the room at the breakfast buffet made the buffet almost impossible to use. Excellent hotel in a perfect location and we couldn’t fault it . Rooms were more than enough in size for 1 adult and 2 kids shared a bed in a twin king room. Breakfast was more than adequate but get there prior to peak hour (7-8 ) is the best time after this it gets crowded.( 8-10 ) as expected. Laundry was excellent @$6 a wash n dry in a very larger commercial washer n dryer . The gym / lifts / room service / doorman /  Reception was excellent and very friendly service  Water coffee / tea  station on ground floor reception area . The location was 3-5 minutes walk maximum to the bright lights of time square . This hotel location is perfectly tucked away from the craziness and noise of time square. Great security hotel with a key pass to enter after dark and key pass to the hotel Pre Cuise Stay- ANY NEGATIVE REVIEWS ARE COMPLETELY WRONG‼️  From the moment a very GREAT UBER DRIVER UNLOADED our luggage on the ride from JFK AIRPORT ($140)  The HOTEL was perfect for our 3 night pre cruise stay.  Kimberlii at the front desk was SO NICE... as ALL THE STAFF... I knew  I HAD DONE GREAT when I overlooked the few Negative reviews that gave me a little concern.   THEY WERE WRONG & Obviously TRAVEL SNOBES.   I worked on the road for 50 years.  Hotels are HOME‼️. And as a HILTON GUY this hotel in the center of NYC IS GREAT.   I am from the South and HOSPITALITY and just good manners with easy going demeanor took me around the WORLD discovering THAT ALL MANKIND CAN MAKE OUR LIVES MORE ENJOYABLE - Even in Tough Times -that 99% of humans respond WELL given the respect I picked Hampton Inn /Times Square Central because we wanted walking distance to theaters, food, Times Square, and Broadway shows.  It was the perfect spot! Joe's NY Pizza was around the corner, we right near Times Square, went to Broadway show, Crispy creme doughnuts, M & M store - all within waking distance! The free breakfast was good and plentiful! We got rooms on the second floor - so no wait for elevators! The people who work for Hampton Inn were knowledgeable and very helpful. They hold your bags for no fee! It was nice to have cold water or hot tea or coffee in the foyer to take to your rooms. Rooms were clean with plenty of fresh towels. I was able to get a refrigerator at no charge to keep my medicine cold! I would HIGHLY recommend HamptonInn Manhattan/Times Square From the moment the checked in (super early) and they let us have our room to the moment we checked out the customer service at this location was top notch! All the staff, every shift was lovely and friendly. The night shift however, Rochelle, Kimberli, Carlos and a gentleman whose name escapes me ( but you know who you are) were SO AWESOME! They went above and beyond for us and especially for my kids. Giving them treats and walking them around and just interacting with them and making them feel special. It was a stellar experience and we will for sure visit that location again. Also the location of the hotel is perfect.  the hotel is very clean and i feel safe. the location is great as it is right around the corner from times square! the staff are AMAZING!! they are all so friendly and helpful! if i come back to nyc in the future, i’ll be coming back here!  We were in NYC last month for2 days and nights prior to a cruise.  The last time that we were in NYC a number of years ago, we stayed at a Hampton in mid-Manhattan because of the location and was looking to do so again but that property was no loner there / not a Hampton.  After a quick search, I found this one that was a few blocks more west.    We had an early Saturday morning flight from Orlando and made it to the hotel around 11:30am.  I had requested early check-in if possible but didn't expect to be able to get into the room this early but a very nice front desk clerk was able to get us in a room right away which was great.  The room with a king size bed was very comfortable.  The property seems to be fairly new and in good shape.  We asked for extra pillows and they were I loved staying here. It's such a convenient location, and everything is walking distance. There was complimentary breakfast provided. All the staff were very helpful and friendly. My hotel room was clean, and there was some rooftop access as well. Albeit, there were no chair or tables on the roof, and it was a bit of a small space. Checking and checking out was a breeze. I'm happy I chose to stay at Hampton Inn Manhattan and would most definitely come back.  Location is excellent for Times Square, Central Park and subway stations. Hotel is good value, basic breakfast, rooms are clean and quiet. Hotel staff are professional, friendly and provide excellent customer service. A block from Time Square but not in the high pedestrian traffic way. Front of house staff not very accommodating. Elevators are often full and took long to get up and down from our room.  Breakfast was nice.  We had such a pleasant stay that I was compelled to write a review.  The staff at this Hampton Inn is top notch.  Over and above friendly - and always looking for ways to help or improve your stay.  I have never experienced a more accommodating and happy staff - excellent experience.  Thank you!! Great location, nice breakfast although very crowded. Clean and comfortable although very small rooms but typical for NYC. Had some difficulty getting on elevators at times so the lower floors to use the stairs worked out well. Also recommend rooms to the back of the building away from the street noise which was nice and quiet. Would definitely use again. This hotel was perfect for me and my two teenagers.  We had never been to NYC before and wanted to do all the tourist attractions and spent a lot of time on the subway. 42nd/Times square is a major stop in that line and it is literally across the street from the hotel. We also were within walking distance from our Broadway show, and dining places (you need a slice of Joe’s).   The staff was so pleasant and treated us with the utmost respect. There is a convenience store in the lobby which made it so great to just run down for a water or cokes. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. My two favorite things are the free breakfast and the fact that they stored our bags for us after we checked out since we had a late flight. Concierge also made arrangements for a car Great Location. Half a block from time square, subway and bus services, Perfect for taking a bus if going to Met Life Staduim. Rooms where nice and very clean. Breakfast was good but too crowded and difficult to find seating. Overall a very good Hotel and Location. Great service from front desk staff. We stayed in this hotel for six nights on our first NY trip as a family. This is the place to stay in NYC for many reasons. Centrally located in Times Square, the Empire State Building, and all other attractive places in NYC.  Most importantly, first-class hotel service with complimentary breakfast, super clean rooms (cleaned daily), and friendly and professional staff from the front desk to the breakfast bar. I can`t remember the names of two smiley ladies in the breakfast bar who provided great hospitality.  If it was not that standard you can`t enjoy a week's holiday. The staff, breakfast, and cleanliness were first class. We had an enjoyable time on our NYC family trip and the hotel was one of the great parts of it. It is a lifetime memory. If I go back, I would definitely This was a good hotel to stay at for the night before our cruise left from the Manhattan Cruise Terminal.   Being in the Times Square area, there are a multitude of places to visit and eat at.   The staff was friendly and there was good breakfast in the morning so didn't have to go out and find something.  The room was comfortable and quiet.  We have no complaints about the hotel and would stay there again. A great hotel Centrally located in NYC Times Square. Front desk was friendly at checking. Coffee , tea and water available In lobby. Breakfast 6-10am in large room features waffle irons , egg,sausage,potato, cereal breads and pastries. Breakfast staff helpful and works hard to keep everything well stocked. King room was small but didn’t spend much time there. Bonus. Rooftop view was nice I love staying in hotels that provide me a adequate breakfast for free! Every morning there were eggs, either bacon or sausage patties, waffle makers and the accompanying condiments, yogurt, oatmeal, muffins, bagels, and toast…on and on and on! The rooms were clean, tidy and spacious, and the staff was amazing! The front office supervisor Jose Taveras was accommodating as well as the entire front desk staff and Security. This is THE place to stay in NYC.  Centrally located at 41st and 7th next to Time Square, the hotel provides all of the services you need, to include a concierge. The complimentary breakfast is first rate, the rooms are super clean and cleaned daily, and the concierge service is invaluable. It seems that anything you need to help make your stay more enjoyable is a basic part of their job description. \"},\n",

Great location right in the middle of the tourist craziness. Tip: if you are parking a car go online to Icon and prepay your parking. You’ll get a discount by doing it ahead of time.  Choose the lot at 1601 Broadway. Our car was safe throughout the stay, despite our initial concerns about leaving it in an unattended, albeit enclosed lot overnight. Upon check in they weren’t able to get our family on one floor, but an extremely helpful front desk lady made quick arrangements and got us switched to connecting rooms immediately. I only wish I got her name to personally call her out and thank her, but I hope she sees the review Do not stay here.  The rooms are unbearably hot and they will DO NOTHING.  Front desk is terrible and managers are no help.   I eventually was able to get a fan but stay was still miserable and there are so many better options around and for less money Pros: Great location Spacious, updated room Friendly and helpful staff Bar and coffee shop in lobby Cons: Terrible lighting in the bathroom Took forever for the water in shower to get hot and didn\\'t last long The overall location is fine depending on where you want to be, but the entrance area can be difficult to find and navigate. The rooms were good sized and clean. There is not a fridge in the room and they said they had none to bring. It’s supposed to be a non-smoking hotel, but that is not enforced even when notified. Here is the reason we will never stay there again. Each of our 3 nights there we (2 of us) both experienced complete loss of hot water only about 5 minutes in to our showers…every time without fail. We notified front desk on each occasion with no new results.  I stayed here over New Year.  Worst hotel i have ever stayed in in terms of service and being lied to by hotel staff, including management. Since the bankruptcy of this place, it seems they only want you money. Bad customer service, bad attitude when you ask them anything, and poor service.   I am an IHG platinum elite, which allows me to select a free drink or points on check-in. I was not even offered that, then when I asked, they stated they had not got the vouchers. What vouchers, surely they could print them up. In my opinion, they just wanted to save $$.   I thought I would then ask for a late check out. They then said they were fully booked, yet when I tried to reserve a room, there were plenty available. Yet again, another lie. I phoned for an additional blanket 3 times, Very rude staff and long wait times. The only decent aspect of this hotel is the location. Would not recommend at all. Staff is slow to attend to basic requests such as extra soap or towels. Hotel is grossly overpriced without the most basic of amenities. Room is not soundproof so it is noisy and hard to sleep at night. Rooms are clean however. While this hotel is in a great location, it was a very poor room. The  shower plate was falling off with dirt falling in the tub,  the phone was dead and the bathroom was unclean. There was no microwave or fridge. For $500 a night it should have at least be clean and have a working phone for emergencies. The check in staff did not seem aware that 20 feet from them was an in house restaurant. No recommendation to stay here. Find an alternate!! Unfortunately this hotel was a disappointment for us on our honeymoon to New York! Thankfully we were only here for 3 nights and went to a different hotel in soho! The reception staff were rude and rolled their eyes when we asked them to organise/ring a taxi for us to bring us to soho. They said “there are hardly any taxis here and it is very hard to get a taxi” even though this hotel is based just off Times Square!! We will not be staying here again.  I love NYC! And if this Hotel wasn’t located where it was. I probably would not ever stay here. First off the Rooms were HOT HOT HOT! Not a good hot, but the room tempt was set @75. And no way to lower it. The Men in charge of luggage were not nice or pleasant. We called @7am to have our luggage brought down. After waiting 2 hours we decided to bring our own down. When asked the men standing in front of the luggage room why there was not help provided when we called the front desk.? The Hispanic man in the suit said oh well.?! What a nice response to a guest who spent 5 nights in your establishment that you work for. I\\'ll start positive with the location. The location was great if you want to be in the middle of everything and walking distance to a lot of shopping.  The negative is we went the week before Christmas so the temp outside was mid to upper 30\\'s. When we checked in our room was 74 degrees so we immediately turned the thermastat down and left to explore the city. We came back the room was still 74 degrees and very stuffy. Called the front desk, they send the maintenance guy who tells us the whole hotel is the same temperature and told us to open the window. We opened the window and he turned our room unit off. The room stayed 74 degrees. We barely slept because it stayed so stuffy even with the window cracked open.  We went to the front desk the next morning and heard a couple We had a reservation with a late check in. They ran my cc but my bank thought the $1700.00 was fraud, told bank it was good BUT the hotel cancelled my reservation with no contact or anything. My cc was fine if they would have reached out. Terrible customer service! I booked this place for convenience during our trip. I saw some reviews that were less than outstanding and I have to say my expectations were EXCEEDED. Our room was plenty big. The bathroom was spacious and clean (and I get weirded out by hotels and cleanliness). The staff was so nice and the check in was fast. Elevators are fast as well. I would definitely recommend and stay here again. The price couldn\\'t be beat and the proximity to everything was ideal! Thanks for a great trip! Booked for 5 nights via British Airways. Paid extra for Times Square view which was definitely worth it. Hotel  was in a great location for getting around Manhattan. Room not as big as I was expecting but defintely adequate. Clean, comfy, what more can you want. We all had the best nights sleep for a long time. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful and a credit to the hotel. We would definitely stay here again! A truly wonderful stay at Crowne Plaza Times Square.  We asked for and got an upper floor room with a view overlooking Times Square.  The room was spacious, the bed comfortable, plenty of hot water, and daily maid service.  We asked for a blanket, and it was promptly delivered to our room.  The  breakfast “cafe” had many and delicious offerings.  It’s not truly a cafe, as there is no seating…it’s grab and go which is perfect for an early start to a busy day of sightseeing.  The hotel bar had great service, truly friendly, and had food offerings as well.  Everyone was helpful,  and the doorman (?) gave excellent directions to these first-time visitors as we navigated the city.  Great location but with that comes massive crowds.  Our stay was the weekend before  Christmas so a This hotel did not let us down. We had been warned to be aware of small rooms in other places, but this room was to the back of the hotel with a view between buildings of the river. The room was large and clean and the most comfortable bed. Staff were so helpful and lovely. The room was done everyday and spotless. Right on Times Square ideal for everything to get to. We would have no hesitation in returning. It was recommended to us and I’m now passing on the recommendation. In house diner would have made it perfect but did not spoil our experience. Pros: Great location very conveniently located to Times Square and subway station. Escalator on street level to elevator/ lobby makes room access easy and fast. Elevators were extremely fast, never had to wait longer than a few seconds. Cons: We paid extra for a Times Square view room. I didn\\'t see it being worth the extra cost with the room/view we had. Our room stayed 85-87 degrees the entire stay. When we called maintenance, we got a vague explanation that there is no AC and to just open the window and they could provide a box fan. This made the stay very uncomfortable. The beds were terrible, stiff and dirty. No microwave or mini fridge in a room when you\\'re paying this much is crazy. The hotel and rooms especially are dated and not a reflection of the prices they charge to DO NOT STAY AT THE CROWNE OLAZA TIMES SQUARE! Crowne plaza calls itself upscale and sophisticated but they are far from it! Disaster from the moment we arrived. First they couldn’t find one of the rooms we paid completely in full for, a month and a half prior to our trip, BUT most important….  WE HAD NO AIR CONDITIONING IN OUR ROOM for the three days we stayed there! We brought this up multiple times to the hotel and they did NOTHING. It was 76 degrees in our room the entire weekend for an $800+ a night hotel! Aside from that, the tub was old and delapidated, the sink filled up with water and the counter top looked disgusting, the ice machine on our floor and soda/water machine were both broken. The concierge told us to go to other floors to get ice and the floors we visited Lobby decorated beautifully.  Joanie V. In the cocktail lounge was top notch.  Room clean however room temperature would not go below 72 degrees.  Multiple calls to have fan brought to room fell on deaf ears.  Ive machine on floor was unplugged and not in service.  There was NO HOT WATER in the shower morning or night. Only warm sink water first night we were there.  Help desk answered calls but didn’t do a thing.  Very dissapointing.  We took a cab from Penn Station to the hotel which we now know was stupid.  The subway is just a short walk from the hotel and a lot less money. Took that route to go back to Penn. The hotel was a bit hard to locate but with a little looking up we did find the sign.  The cab had dropped us on the Times Square side of the hotel not near the lobby entrance. We arrived at the hotel about 11 am but were told we couldn\\'t get into our room until check in at 2.  The lobby was so full of people waiting so there was No where to sit. So we checked our bags and headed out. The room was a typical high traffic tourist hotel.  Not very modern, a little run down but the bed was comfortable and it was in the heart of the action.  They are in the process of doing major renovations to the All systems down at the Crowne Plaza but the worst was the treatment of all the guests who couldn\\'t check in.  Arrived early and it was $75 to check in but guaranteed at 300.  By 330 no systems up.  Got on phone to main help number as front desk said it would be hours and my associate and i had flown in for business.  After being hung up on 3 times with customer service (all nice people but after each transfer we were then transferred to a completely new person).  Tried to get another IHG hotel, any hotel, to get ready for an early evening business meeting.  The 4th try got a lovely customer service rep who asked to speak to the manager as she had had no luck reaching them.  I took the phone to the manager who was very frustrated as customers were all asking when they\\'d get a This was a last minute booking as initially we had booked another IHG hotel but not as central. We liked this hotel, lovely view of the cruise ships (we were in town for 2 nights before we got on ours) and we woke to see here the morning we were departing. The bed was huge and so comfy! Bathroom clean and nice walk in shower. 1 small gripe the towels were too small for coming out the shower, they hay went round me and I’m just average build. I have marked 4/5 as what really frustrated me was our key was clearly only programmed for 1 night. We got back from a day of sightseeing, all the way back to the 44th floor and red lock, key not valid! We go all the way down to reception and ask them to reprogram it, they did (but they didn’t) back up to 44th floor and still not working. Bad experience on my trip. I recently stayed at this hotel Nov 29-Dec 1 2023, and was very disappointed. I had NO HOT WATER for 2 days the ac/heat did not work properly. The worst part of my stay was the loud noises from the vents. It sounded like the vents were breaking or gargling for 2 days... we weren\\'t able to get any sleep. Just all around very uncomfortable. I paid $450 dollars per night for such a terrible experience. Not to mention the amenities are none existent. Not even a robe or microwave unless you want to pay $30 extra. I brought my son so he could experience the Rockefeller tree lighting hoping to have a pleasant and peaceful stay. That did not happen. Rockefeller was great but the Crowne Plaza hotel was a huge disappointment. This is unfortunate because I wanted The computer system has been down for 3 hours as of this time 6:00pm.  We cannot check into our room…. We are exhausted and they have no back up plan.   There are over 100 ticked off people waiting in line.  There is currently no one at the desk as the staff are seriously hiding from telling guests that they cannot go to their rooms.  No back up system when their computers go down?  The STUPIDEST thing I ever heard of.  Also, their own staff said that this has been going on for weeks and they have not fixed their computer system! Arrived late at night and was greeted by a somewhat convoluted entry, greeted by a suspicious doorman who had to guide us to the front desk, located somewhere in the middle of the building.  Front desk staff was adequately functional, but not what I would describe as \"friendly\" or \"welcoming\".  NYC culture, I guess.  That said, the night janitor who was cleaning the floors was super helpful and friendly. Move that guy to the front desk!  The building has a split tower layout of some kind so you have to switch elevators, mid-travel, depending on where your room is. Confusing and something the front desk staff might have mentioned.  Arrived in our $450/night room, which was permeated by an offensive odor, had a poorly patched up ceiling,  was cramped and was filthy.  The mattress I was treated with hate and racism. It\\'s hard to admit that I was in tears after speaking with Sheena! And I\\'m over 40 yrs old. Our family has a lot of traveling experiences, therefore meeting someone like her in a hotel of global recognition is a shock. Her attitude is next level of treating guest disrespectful. When I tried to contradict her, she started threatening me with security. She practically decided in advance to NOT help  and was enjoying all my growing frustration. The situation was of technical matter and I\\'m convinced we could\\'ve solved it in any other hotel with normal management. I\\'m  surprised to read older bad reviews about Sheena, and yet she\\'s still there. IHG Hotel please do better with choosing the right employees. This room had an excellent view of Times Square, right in the center of the action. Close to Times Square Station where you can pretty much connect to the whole city. The staff was very accommodating and gave us a stress-free check-in.  Arrived at the hotel on day of check-in to be told that they did not have any of the room type we had booked (and paid extra for) and that they would have to downgrade us for the night and we would need to go back to reception the next day for them to move us to the room we actually booked and paid for. I did say that I wasn’t happy to be told that there was nothing they could do apart from maybe waive the nightly facility fee which I had already paid in full for our stay through Booking.com. We took the downgraded room as we had no option and when we arrived, the room was filthy, it had a dirty, old wash cloth over the shower head, blood on the bed sheets (I have photos which I also sent to the manager), the lamps did not work and neither did the hairdryer. The USB charger on Gabriela Peraita, she gave great!! service , paid attention to all our needs , she went above and beyond all needs and  services. You need more people like her 1st class service and very polite. I can\\'t say enough good about her. The Crowne Plaza has a great location - it is within easy walking distance of the 50th Street \"E\" line subway which connects direct to the JFK Airtrain - manageable even with a bag. There is parking on site if you are driving. All the theatres of Broadway are close and there is a CVS opposite, so it is very convenient.  The front desk staff are friendly. There is a gym nearby at a partner hotel and a bar on site for evening drinks, but not restaurant. For breakfast there is a takeout coffee shop  at the back of the lobby with salads, wraps and French pastries. That was fine.  The rooms are spacious and high up (starting 28th floor to 40+ floors) with very comfortable beds and large bathrooms. Rooms were clean and quiet with efficient wifi. No complaints. It wasn\\'t cheap, but This is my second time staying at this hotel and it was another comfortable experience. Sandra at the front desk was so kind and answered all of my questions. I really appreciated the great customer service after a long day of travel.  They did return my security deposit .They charged us 50 dollars per night !   Charged on 4th october till 9th October . I stayed 5 nights under the name Raafay Israr & Mahnoor Fayyaz . Its been over a month now . Need to resolve this asap ! My email address  Mahnoorf@hotmail.com. I was surprised to see that I never got my deposit back from the hotel. I\\'ve tried numerous times to get in touch with them regarding this matter, but nothing happened up to the moment. I\\'ve never encountered this and I cannot see any rational reason about it.  Third time I stayed here, but the hotel is in need of a renovation. The room we had was with partial Times Square view. The view is amazing. I had mailed the hotel to be able to get an upgrade with better views and higher floor. They mailed me back and told me to ask at checkin desk.. there they told me it was impossible to change room.. never heard that before. Didn\\'t feel ok.  Will not stay here again, way better options nearby in the same price range Not one hot shower was made available for any of the 3 nights in Oct that i was in NYC.   Asked to transfer to new room...non available.  Talk about an issue taking the fun out of a \"fun trip\".  Waited for GM to return emails regarding this issue...did not happen...poor customer service...too busy I guess. Great location.  Fair priced.  Not the friendliest of people.  Some minor issues - ice machine didn’t work for three days.  No refrigerator in room.  Poor customer service - took three calls to get a late check out and the operator was very rude!  If you don’t mind the poor customer service it is an excellent location! Location is convenient for shows and getting uptown and downtown, so that’s why it has 2 stars. We didn’t have a warm shower any of the 3 nights/4 days we stayed here. We finally asked the front desk to have someone take a look at it. So they took away our bath mat instead. Being from Minnesota, I admire the passive aggressiveness of that. The hotel is horrible. The temperature was 77 degrees in our room. Too hot to sleep. Too hot to rest. When I called the front desk, I got told the heat is on and the operator hung up. I ended up having to contact upper management multiple times before the issue was addressed. Eventually, a service man came up and opened the unit. The filter was filthy. When my partner tried to photograph the filth, he literally ran away. It took over 3 hours to get the heat addressed. It took hours to cool. The thermostat doesn’t work in the room. Someone in the hotel sent room service to our room at 11:30 at night to antagonize us, because we complained that it was too hot to sleep the night before. Piss poor management. Avoid this place at all costs. Rude unprofessional staff. I could go on I am used to New York hotels, that are often of rather poor quality compared to the rest of the world, inevitably due to the high number of tourists all year round.   I was staying here for 3 nights on a long weekend to visit friends. I paid for this hotel with my IHG points, and even with my Platinum Elite status I was not provided with an upgrade. I was assigned room 3715, a rather shabby room redecorated perhaps 20 years ago which reminded me of a much lower category of hotels. Nonetheless the room was functional, but lacked a fridge (or a mini bar), slippers, bathrobes, and to my surprise not even a bottle of water. There was a coffee machine of sorts, with barely drinkable coffee.  As I arrived to the hotel late afternoon after a long flight from Europe, a bottle of water We were very happy with our stay at the Crowne Plaza. We had a corner room which was much bigger than your standard New York hotel room. We also had a good view of Times Square. The bed was extremely comfortable and we had maid service every day.  No breakfast but, there was a coffee shop in the lobby, as well as a really nice bar overlooking Broadway. We found al staff to be very helpful.'},\n",

We did not eat at the hotel, only because we were too This beautiful old hotel was the haunt of Elvis, the Beatles, Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant (born Archie Leach from Bristol), and now the Z list celebrity author of this review.  Very comfortable room, helpful efficient staff.  Catering not sampled as we ate elsewhere.  Relatively low rise building showing its age in places, windows a tad draughty, heating eccentric.  Minor issues sorted swiftly by staff, and the cystern fixed by myself.  Say what you want, but Americans know the value of excellent service, pulling out all the stops to earn their tips, unlike in our creaky, on life support, home country UK.  Highly recommended and will visit again next time in NYC.   While the hotel is old, it is well maintained. The suite, looking at 6th Avenue, was excellent in size. Also, considering it is in a busy area, relatively quiet. Front desk personnel were terrific and the hotel location was perfect.   The downsides were minimal, including some burnt out lightbulbs. The bathroom was tiny - there was no place to even lay out your clothes. Other than that, a great find. A friend and I travelled to NYC for the holidays and stayed at the Warwick.  I lived in NYC for a long time and am familiar with the area, and I did a lot of research before booking this hotel.  We had a wonderful stay at the Warwick!  The location is ideal for the holidays.  We saw the Rockets at Radio City Music Hall a few blocks away, and we were able to walk to both Broadway shows we saw.   Very close to Bloomingdale\\'s, Serendipity, FAO Schwartz, Central Park and more.  The hotel is a few blocks north of the busiest areas, which was helpful for getting around if you want to avoid some of the walking traffic during busy seasons.  Room was clean, quiet and quite spacious for NYC.  We had a city view room, which was lovely.  I joined the Warwick Rewards Program beforehand, Suppose to have 2 rooms with views, both looked at brick walls, courtyards of concrete. Nov 2021.. Elevators; when hotel booked may wait for 2-4 elevators. Staff not as friendly as in other boutique hotels. I love the proximity of this hotel to place to eat and things to see all a short walking distance away. MOMA is just around the corner. Central Park a few blocks away. The bar can get a little noisy, but the staff always recognize you when you return a year later.  Plus of course the Warwick has a great history. The Beatles stayed there and Dylan visited them. Cary Grant lived there for 12-years. Just spent 3 nights here with three others for a girls weekend, in two rooms. Both rooms were very nice and comfortable.  Both faced a brick wall, which others have complained about- but the upside is there’s no street noise at all.  All of the staff we interacted with were very helpful, friendly, upbeat.  The location can’t be beat.  I don’t think I’d ever stay anywhere else in the future.  Only downside is at busy times, it’s hard to get an elevator..but we learned to use the service elevator- problem solved William Randolph Hearst built this hotel so that his girlfriend Marion Davies and their other famous friends would have a place to stay in New York while she was performing down the street at the Ziegfeld Theater. Now that’s a baller move!  Cary Grant lived at the Warwick and the Beatles stayed there in the 60s. Flash forward to today and you have a moderately priced, clean and comfortable hotel right in the heart of midtown. I am always reluctant to suggest diamonds in the rough like the Warwick as I want to keep the secret to myself but here you go. My only critiques are the lack of cocktail options in the hotel and the elevator situation. The bar is only open 5-11pm daily and I went to have a Bloody Mary for brunch only to learn that they don’t serve until noon. Elevators are My husband and I spent a week at the Warwick at the end of October. Our room was large and comfortable and we had a pleasant stay. The hotel is well located and walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, Broadway and Rockefeller Center. The MOMA is around the corner. The staff were friendly and helpful. The elevators are small and in high demand in the mornings but the staff showed us to another set of elevators as we were departing which made it much easier to manage with our suitcases. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel as it was pricey, but there are several nearby options.  This is not a new, modern, hotel but an older building with history, charm and a few quirks. We found its room rate to be relatively reasonable compared with similar properties and would be happy I have found a home for my future New York City trips!    The Warwick NY was the quintessential hotel ...... exceptional staff inside and out, classy hotel, fantastic location, interesting history, and gorgeous room with balcony. We arrived quite late after a long flight and the hotel staff were really warm and welcoming. We’d read reviews about the hotel looking tired and dated but in all honesty we thought the original features all added to its charm. The rooms were clean and whilst we did hear some beeping from cars outside it didn’t keep us up at night.   We were in the city for the marathon and it’s location is really well placed for getting to Central Park. There’s also a number of underground stops nearby so nothing had to be a long walk if you didn’t want it to be. 5th Avenue is just around the corner and Times Square about 10mins walk away.   We chatted to the staff throughout our trip and they couldn’t do enough for you when needed. Id left my AirPods in the room and only noticed when I’d A historical hotel right in the core of New York city, very central and in an excellent neighborhood. The room was very comfortable, and extremely decorated. The staff was very nice, and helpful. Definitely a place to stay in New York! Although is an historical hotel, it has accompanied the evolution of times and preserves its main decor lines. There\\'s no place quite like New York City. The world-class museums, amazing food, and unforgettable views—there\\'s always something new and exciting to discover.   We love the awesome architecture and parks, taking in the city’s grandeur from observation decks at icons like the Empire State Building and Top of the Rock, or on a stroll across the Brooklyn Bridge or Brooklyn Heights Promenade.   Stayed on this hotel during a business trip. Convenient location but the facilities are very tired and in need of refurbishment. No towels in the bathroom. Tiny gym.  Location is convenient if you want to be in that part of Manhattan but extremely noisy - avoid rooms facing 6th avenue I travelled to New York from Australia for my Birthday. I mentioned this to the Cabin Crew on Qantas, who presented me with a bottle of Champagne to drink on my Birthday in 2 days time. Upon arriving at The Warwick I asked if there was a fridge in the room for my Champagne. The Receptionist explained, No, there wasn\\'t a fridge, but I could hire a small Bar fridge from them. On relaying the Qantas Birthday present story to him, he waved the fee as a Birthday gesture from the hotel. The hotel is historic, elegant, comfortable & in the most fabulous location. Times Square, Central Park, 42nd Street, 5th Avenue are all minutes away. The Randolph Bar off the Lobby is elegant & full of Business Execs relaxing after work. My room was large & looked onto 6th Avenue, for people watching. Very helpful staff, rooms have a historic feel, nice decor and quite spacious. Internet worked well. The lobby is lively. The hotel charges $2 per bag for storage. Walkable to most things to see & do in NYC. Would suggest to upgrade the room TV to smart TVs. 1) The bar does not open until 5 PM.  Strange.  Several times we wanted a martini in the afternoon and had to go to another hotel bar. 2) The closet door in our room had a large hole in it- it had been patched, but now that was deteriorating. 3) The restaurant charges $6 for EACH ice tea.  No free refills. 4) our room was OK, rather bland-  the bathroom could use some updating. 5) Great location, nice staff, clean.  Found The Warwick to be a charming hotel in a fantastic location - walking distance to Central Park, Bryant park, 5th Avenue, Broadway, Times Square, Empire State Building and many other key tourist sites.  Our room was a great size compared to other, newer hotels, plenty of storage to accommodate a teenager\\'s many wardrobe options and wi-fi that was also fast enough to feed the teenager\\'s social media requirements.  Furnishings are a little dated but it kind of added to the charm, and finding the right temperature on the shower took a bit of trial and error. The room was perfectly clean and staff friendly and helpful.  Would definitely return No, not what you’re thinking. It wasn’t the obvious nominal attraction, or seeing Warwick written all over the place in that decorous Art Deco font. Rather it is what Dennis Denuto would call “the vibe”, or – if you will pardon my French – the je ne sais quoi.  There are newer hotels in Mid-Town Manhattan, like the anodyne Hilton across the road, and more famous ones, like the Plaza, around which Neil Simon sweetly, or suitely, fashioned his series of one act plays. But there’s just that something about The Warwick that took us there the first time, and back twice since, the latest in September for a fortnight: The chance to stay where the young Elvis stayed, and where the Beatles did their press conference in 1965.  Cary Grant lived there permanently for more than a decade. And They upgraded me to a suite with a dinning area and living room and separate bedroom. Great views up and down 6th avenue from my room and a total comfort environment.  If any downside the bathroom is quite small and the toilet is very small and short making it difficult for a big guy. (not a problem for my return) It is easy to get to the Broadway shows (we did 3 this week) and loads of dinning spots near the home.  One of the hotels I will return to in the city.   We stayed for 8 nights in a Premier Suite with a separate living room.  I had thought the sofa was a sofa bed, but this was not the case.  No worries though - called the front desk and a good-quality cot was brought up. Might be worth it to pay a bit extra for a view.  I didn\\'t realize that \"no view\" didn\\'t just mean a poor view - you are literally looking at a brick wall. Can\\'t see the sky or the ground.   There was a fridge (and a minibar) and coffee machine in our room.  Microwaves are not available. LOVED the doormen. They were all super cool! Front desk was great, housekeeping was great.  Zero complaints during our 8 nights.   First time at this hotel. Picked it because of the one bedroom option which is perfect for families. Upon walking in we were very impressed with our room. Old school New York elegant. Comfortable and well appointed.  The only major problem was with the lack of transparency and lame explanation for putting us in a corner room facing brick walls. It was unacceptable for them to relate this time and again. “We are sold out” is not an excuse for charging full rate for a room that was located in the worst possible corner of the hotel.  They have no business charging full rate for a room that feels like you are in solitary confinement.   Otherwise great location, close enough to the sites and restaurants but far away from the crowds. The service was great!The rooms comfortable and beautifully decorated. If needed housekeeper available anytime. Great bar.Clean,Beautiful.Staff pleasant.The door man very nice.Experience wonderful .P.s.jus get a room with a view. The place is infested with Cockroaches, it\\'s crazy! I found three in my room this morning in the matter of 3 minutes, two dead and one alive in the closet to greet me when I opened the door. I told the manager and he said let me see the pictures (as if he didn\\'t know there was a Cockroach problem), and as I was showing him another dead cockroach showed-up right next to the desk in the lobby (can\\'t make this up, and all the Manager and his clerk started doing was laughing when I showed them the cockroach next to their own desk)...Never will stay here again, especially since they failed to fully comp my room and only provided a $150 discount.  I\\'ve stayed at the Warwick several times over the years, and always appreciated the fact that this venerable hotel, though no longer top tier, was comfortable and well-located. But based on my recent trip, I won\\'t do another stay. This time around I found the rooms to be depressingly bare. The air conditioning didn\\'t appear to be working in the hallways -- which we know about because we spent an inordinate amount of time in them, waiting for the elevator to come (a major problem unto itself that the hotel needs to deal with.) At check-out time there looked to be a line out the door to store luggage, and I heard someone say that there was a charge for doing so -- definitely a first. In short, aside from the friendly staff, the Warwick no longer has anything to recommend it, and Excellent central location. Only short walk to Central Park, Times Square, Broadway.  Nice staff. Great quiet room Has a great restaurant and close many other options for meals. It was my first time in NYC and I would definitely use this hotel again. Nothing special. If you’re looking for an average,  clean room then this is an ideal choice. There was lots of noise when people walked outside the room. It was hard to sleep at time due to that. Room was clean, bathroom was clean but not much of a view. I booked this hotel as a package through Last-minute.com, as it was well-priced and the location was good. It was near Central Park, and there was a Prets around the corner and a couple of food stores very nearby. When I arrived I was told I\\'d been upgraded to a suite! It was absolutely lovely - bigger than my first apartment! There was a living room, large bedroom, bath and shower, a tiny kitchen, two TVs, walk in cupboard with hairdryer, iron and ironing board, safe, and luggage stand; two bottles of water, a coffee maker, slippers, recycling bins, desk with sockets, and loads of drawer units. There were three windows... the only downside was that the views from each were brick walls! But I wasn\\'t there for the view! Staff were lovely, very helpful, especially the doorman who We used the Warwick for our wedding room block. After a few weeks, we noticed that our block wasn\\'t filled up. It turned out that the room rate they booked our room at was a 30% _PREMIUM_ over the published website rate.  We tracked down all of the relevant confirmation numbers of those that booked outside the block, but they still made it a massive hassle to meet our minimum. We tried to add suites for our family to increase our block utilization and they simply did not respond... for weeks. Eventually we booked the suites on their website, which they refused to include in the block utilization. At one point they swore off our block entirely and forwarded us to their legal department.  The hotel itself is better than a motel if you like small rooms designed in the early 1990s. This is an older hotel in a perfect location, around the corner from MOMA, a block from Fifth Avenue, a short walk to St. Patrick’s, Rockefeller Center, Sak’s! My room was large and light, though the view was just a generic city view. But it’s gigantic! ( My room was on the 31st floor.) That means hordes of guests and a flurry of activity in the lobby. The desk staff processed us in and out like cattle. I missed a personal, friendly touch. When I asked for change for a big bill so I could leave a tip for housekeeping,  I got : “We don’t give change.” After that I stayed out of their way. The staff in the breakfast room were friendlier. We just had an amazing experience at the Warwick! I absolutely love that hotel. With all the hustle and bustle of New York it is a quiet luxury. We had room 2309 which had a huge terrace, lovely king bed and nice sitting area. Loved it!! A very beautiful building at a perfect location in Midtown. We walked easily to Times Square, Central Park, the Museum of Natural History, Summit one, Grand Central Terminal, Bryant Park, Rockefelller etc. We had a premier suite with city view and city view we definitely had! Loved it. The Suite was very big and had one bedroom so it was perfect because we travelled with our infant.  Great location and kind, helpful staff. We booked city view room with a balcony (2517) and were greeted by the most incredible huge terrace overlooking 6th Ave. If you can overlook few wall cracks and furniture scratches, this hotel is definitely unique and worth considering. It’s different from no character copy/paste newer establishments. Hopefully we will come back. This staid old-line hotel has been a staple place to bed down for years along with the Algonquin, Essex House and others to many to mention.  Located on 6th Avenue and 54th Street, it was convenient to 5th Avenue shopping, the Theater District, Lincoln Center, museums, and a slew of excellent restaurants.  While we were only on the twelfth floor, we had a spacious room with suitable accoutrements including a large sitting area with sofa, lounge chair and writing desk.  The marble bath was well appointed with a suitable number of towels and high-end bath gels, shampoos, conditioners, and hand creams.    The closet was large with a suitcase rest, safe, ironing board and iron, plenty of hangers and a full-length mirror.  The credenza housed a bar refrigerator, as well as many Staying with my husband and two young kids. Charming hotel in the heart of NYC midtown, close to Central Park, Moma, Times Square, metro station. Plenty of restaurants and bakeries.  We booked a room with two doubles for the four of us. On arrival we were told we’d been upgraded to a room with a view. The room did have a decent fourth floor view over 6th Av however the double beds were only just wider than singles. We asked reception if this was normal and the answer was yes, no offer to change. They couldn’t bring an extra mattress either.  Each adult had to share a bed with a kid as there’s no way two adults would fit comfortably in these doubles.  On our last night a massive cockroach came charging out of the ensuit!  If it weren’t for the mini beds and the cockroach I would This hotel, surrounded by scaffold as so many structures are in NY these days is perfectly placed for a weekend in NY, bring a short hop from both Times Square and the Park. Rooms are large and spacious however they are very tired looking and could do with updating and reinvigorating to bring the hotel back to the grandeur of former years. Same can be said for the bathrooms, which are functional but set back in 80s styling and need a revamp Stayed at the Warwick for 6 nights with my partner & 2 children aged 13 & 10. We had read the reviews before booking so joined the Warwick journeys program & booked directly with the hotel as the rate was quite a bit cheaper than on other booking sites. Being members also meant that we didn’t pay any resort fees and got free WiFi (essential with 2 kids!!). The hotel was in an ideal location for us, 12 minute walk to Times Square, only a few blocks from Central Park & only a few minutes from the subway. We booked a premier city view room which looked out onto 6th Ave, 2 queen sized beds & the room was spacious & clean. Had a hairdryer, safe, coffee machine, iron & ironing board, walk in wardrobe, fridge. The air con kept the room lovely & cool. It was cleaned every day. The lifts Arrived from Scotland for my 60th birthday.  I got an email (automated I think) with what extras you could have in your room for arrival.  My husband emailed Guest Services to ask for something in my room for my birthday, but no one got back to him.  So arrived in our room to nothing sadly.  Was a bit upset, as hubby got balloons, cake, macaroons etc but that was a 5 star Scottish hotel.  On check in I was told there was no room service due to covid, but the cleaners were in every day.  I joined the Journey Loyalty Program but didn\\'t get an upgrade which was listed as a bonus and despite it being my 60th birthday.  But we didn\\'t have to pay the gym costs - didn\\'t use it anyway as did enough walking about in NYC.  Chose this hotel for the history .... it was good enough for James My husband and I stayed at the Warwick for four nights, beginning July 19, 2023 in a one bedroom suite with city view (54th St.) This is our third time at the hotel that never disappoints. Previously we had interior views and the city view is of course much superior but the room prices reflect this. As others have said, the location is excellent with a short walk to the F train, 6th Ave. buses, Central Park, restaurants, cafes, museums (right behind MOMA), and Starbucks (but what hotel isn\\'t near a Starbucks!). I\\'m surprised by some of the negative reviews as our room was beautifully appointed, spacious, clean, and quiet. The housekeeping was excellent and all the staff very friendly. Even though the hotel was busy, I did not find the elevators slow  to arrive as some have said A real old-fashioned new york hotel.Not the swankiest,not the most famous but just a lovely quiet hotel that delivers exactly what you want on a stay in the city. The bar is a great spot to lose a couple of hours and overall it is a nice place to retreat when you need a break from having fun around town.'},\n",

Jonathan (doorman) and the entire staff are exceptional. My wife and I highly recommend this hotel to all, especially those who wish to stay near Times Square and the Theater district. What a great hotel on the doorstep of Times Square. My husband and I visited the first week of January and there were so many positives sprinkled with some minor negatives  On arrival we were met with a lovely reception team who explained everything and ensured we were directed to our room. We were shown to the complimentary teas and coffees in the foyer but of course this meant these facilities were not available in the rooms.  There was also a deduction of $275 taken for incidentals and when we checked out advised this takes 2-4 weeks to refund (as a UK bank). Slightly frustrating but can understand the need.  The lifts and the hallway were a little tired but very clean. The room we had was very small and had no natural light and was quite dark. However for what we needed was Outstanding experience! Everyone whom we encountered was welcoming, professional and highly customer service oriented. They seemed committed to providing a superior experience, and succeeded! We have stayed many times before and it will continue to be our go to hotel for a great theater weekend! Thank you!! Great stay again!  Extremely convenient and easy to walk to Broadway.  All team members were great - especially Jonathan!  He went out of his way to make our stay great!  Both restaurants on site were very good as well.  We will return and celebrate there again!! Stayed for 4 nights in early January.  Our room was quite compact but it was warm, surprisingly quiet considering the location and the bed was extremely comfortable.  The shower was lovely - large and very warm with plenty of products supplied.   The hotel has quite a buzz to it: it’s warm and the staff were very friendly - always happy to help with recommendations for places to eat or with advice about easiest ways to access various attractions.   Breakfast was not very varied but it was plentiful and well organised.  Location is perfect- literally yards from the crazy -busy Times Square! We had a great stay here and I would definitely return.  Well done Sanctuary Hotel!  We had an amazing holiday and really enjoyed our stay at the Sanctuary, the room was lovely and very clean and the bed was so comfortable! All the staff were very helpful but we would like to especially thank Jonathan our concierge who on our last day really helped us. Our booked transfer let us down and cancelled our booking for the airport, Jonathan arranged another cab for us and helped us with our cases to a pick up point, we are very grateful thank you Jonathan. I had read mixed reports of the hotel prior to going and regarding the reception staff being so polite and helpful. This was not the welcome we received after a 9 hour journey. The dark haired girl kept her head down all the time and no greeting to the hotel. The two guys on the front door welcomed us with a smile and lifted our bags for us. Rooms are clean but hotel is deceiving as it looks bigger in the photos. Small and dark. After reading reviews that breakfast was changing to better things we looked forward to this, couldn\\'t have been more wrong. We walked in to the dining area and nobody explains to you about seating or where things are.. cardboard cups still being used which was sad. After day 2 we went across the street to the Rui Plaza to meet friends and paid for Lovely hotel in the centre of New York City. We stayed just before Christmas and all the staff were so friendly and helpful, particularly Jonathan who helped us with our bags on our way in and on our way back out.  We stayed 20-23 Dec -perfect location and cosy welcoming feel to the hotel and fantastic comfy beds. We were in a double-double room so not huge amount of space for 4  but were really only in rooms to sleep so was fine - bathroom was great. Breakfast was a bonus and we loved the rooftop bar. The absolute best thing about this hotel is the staff- especially all the door and reception staff - everyone was so friendly and helpful and truly welcoming everyday when we returned to the hotel.  Thanks everyone We didn’t get off to the best start with this hotel but I must say the reception staff were exceptional in dealing with the issues we had. Very understanding and accommodating.   The first room allocated had a musty smell and after reporting this to reception, we were swiftly moved to a room at the front of the hotel facing the street. This room was extremely noisy, and I know given the location being so close to Times Square that this should be expected, but it honestly sounded like we were on the street and not in a hotel room! We did spend the first night in this room but mentioned it to reception in the morning. Reception  staff were understanding and arranged for us to be moved to another room.   The room we eventually settled in didn’t have a view, we were looking out to a We had a great experience at the Sanctuary.  The location was perfect and it was like a warm and cozy oasis coming in after cold days in the city.  The bathroom space was small for two girls getting ready, but we made it work and the overall decor and experience was worth it.  The hotel itself would be very romantic for a couple.  Johnathan and Delvis took great care of us and we would definitely stay here again. LOVED this hotel!! A true unique Boutique Hotel.  The staff was excellent. The guys at the front were awesome (especially Jonathan and Delvis).  We fell in love with place.  100% location!!  You are literally steps from Time Square and the Theater district is very close.  The room had a lot of space at the end of the bed.  Room was clean, bed was very comfortable.  The room was serviced everyday. We enjoyed the breakfast every morning.  It wasn\\'t a lot but enough to get the day started.  We had reservation about the bathroom area, but we ended up loving that too.  The shower does face the bedroom, it has a curtain you can use for privacy if needed.   A small refrigerator is in the room.  The room had two small closets, one with drawers.  The ottoman at the end of the bed had We spent a few days after Christmas in NYC  and were pretty disappointed with the Sanctuary. The entire hotel is dark and the hallways are narrow. The rooms are very small, bed and pillows were uncomfortable, and the TV was old with an On Demand feature that did not work. Our room had a window that looked directly into another wall. The bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a curtain.   The breakfast is really below par - Bagels, toasted waffles, cereal and hard boiled eggs. The Haven rooftop restaurant was not great. I ordered salmon and mashed potatoes that was served cold.   There is a small fitness room in the basement that has new equipment but just  a single treadmill, elliptical, Peloton bike and weight machine.   On the positive side, the location is convenient to Slightly puzzled on arrival as it seemed to resemble going into a brothel - no personal experience here just how I imagined an upmarket one would look! The welcome was exactly what we needed after an 8 hour flight with a four hour delay prior to that. As our bodies were still on UK time they thought it was gone 4am so our first night wasn\\'t the lovely stroll around we\\'d expected, we just fell into bed.  Lovely room, number 608, a big size for New York and absolutely everything, apart from a kettle, that we needed. (Coffee and hot water were available 24/7 in the lobby but its not the same). Seemed rather strange that the bathroom- apart from the toilet- was in the room but no problem at all. One of the cleanest hotel rooms we\\'ve ever stayed in - including bed linens, so very Thank you for making our stay in New York very enjoyable. The hotel is clean, comfortable and the staff make you feel very welcome especially the door staff Vichet and Jonathan. Situated just off Times Square it is perfect for exploring the city. I know boutique hotels specialise in quirky and funky but it wasn’t a particularly enjoyable stay. Perfect location and the door and reception staff were all helpful and professional.   But the lighting is odd - it’s very dark, everywhere. Dingy in fact. The corridors and rooms are all darkened. Rooms are small but clean and reasonable facilities apart from no tea/coffee making option - there is coffee and tea all day in the reception though. Don’t try and swing a cat though….no room. Lovely shower and gels/shampoos etc.   Breakfast was minimalist and staff a bit off and brusque. Toast and pastries mainly, help yourself etc. tables not cleaned during service.  Lift broke down.   The Haven rooftop restaurant/bar is excellent and an obvious draw all day. It feels like it’s the The hotel is one of the poorest I\\'ve stayed in the bedroom is very small nowhere to hang your clothes,no tea making facilities, no ironing board the hotel bar is never open and when it was it closed at 2130 it put a downer on our Christmas holiday.  What an amazing warm friendly hotel. We had an amazing experience helped by an easy access, friendly hotel situated right in Times Square in the middle of everything you need to see. A special mention to Vichet and the rest of his doormen who went above and beyond to welcome us in and make sure we knew where we were going each day. Thankyou guys we’ll be back  Our first time in NYC was made even better with this fabulous hotel. What a perfect location, superb hospitality, clean, warm and cosy in the holiday season - all round brilliant. The doormen and concierge couldn’t have been more helpful, helping us navigate around the city and finding taxis etc. they were able to recommend lots of great restaurants which we tried too. It is a pretty impressive building from the outside - looks lovely lit up with its rooftop bar too. It was really easy to find and as I said before, everything is so accessible from it.   The rooms are quite small - but what do you expect in the middle of NYC?! We made it work and we had enough space to put our case. We were upgraded to a deluxe suite and we loved the room - thank you. The toiletries they give you This was our 1st visit to New York and we couldn\\'t have chosen a better hotel to stay at than the Sanctuary Hotel. From arriving to departing everything was perfect. Check in was nice and smooth, staff on the door and checking in were so friendly and helpful. Our room was perfect for us, the bed was so comfy we wanted to take it home.  The breakfast is included in the tourist charge and is value for money with plenty of options in my view. This is the best hotel my wife and I have stayed in and wouldn\\'t hesitate to book to stay at the Sanctuary again. Thank you to all the staff at the Sanctuary Hotel for making our visit to New York perfect. Jonathan was exceptional and so helpful, making my stay as pleasant, welcoming, accommodating as possible. The friendliness and customer care made my time here a wonderful experience. Thanks Jonathan for going the extra mile each day to make it a fabulous stay during a very busy Christmas season. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience at the Sanctuary Hotel. We arrived before check in and our bags were taken to a secure room and we used the restroom to freshen up for our day of touring NYC. We were in a cozy queen which I was worried about but need not have been. The room was perfect for two people. Comfortable queen bed, nice bathroom/shower, refrigerator and liquor, wine and snacks available for purchase in the room. The lobby was small but beautiful and the staff were so helpful and welcomed us every time we entered and told us to have a nice time when we exited. There is coffee, hot water, and ice water available at the front desk all day long which I loved. Breakfast is included and was mostly carbs, coffee, and juice but great before heading out for the day. The It’s our first time staying at The Sanctuary NYC. We absolutely love it! It smells amazing! We stayed in a Suite and it was amazing. Staff is over the top friendly and accommodating. Beautiful suite, super clean, stylish, stocked with everything you can think of. We even had glass candy jars full of assorted Hershey Kisses!! Highly Recommend booking your stay here while in NYC. You will not be disappointed. Ok let me start with the positives, the bed was very comfortable and room very clean , that’s always a plus, very close to Time Square so great location. Now the negatives, the room was so tiny, we had no where to put cases or clothes, a tiny cubby hole with a few hangers. It was a struggle to actually find room to get dressed.  Lightning very poor, the hotel itself is called the sanctuary and I get that but it’s so dark in the lobby’s and lift areas.  Now to the breakfast if that’s what you call it, do it yourself toast, cheap cereal and a few nature bars. Coffee and tea you made yourself in cardboard cups. Plus on 2 mornings there wasn’t enough room for us to sit down so we didn’t bother.  Would I return to that hotel probably not. This is an intimate hotel with very nice finishes and excellent service at the desk. Raychel in particular was very helpful during my stay. The propane fireplaces and all day coffee service in the small but charming lobby are a plus. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT GO from the outside it looks very inviting however, once you enter it is dark, dismal and dated.  Breakfast,  if you can call it that is very poor, no hot food available, basically three choices of cheap cereals, a couple of toasters, a handful of Danish and that is about it!  No coffee or drink making facilities in your room. However, they do offer free, 24 hour hot drinks in the lobby.  which is wholly impractical as you have to walk all the way down the stairs, every time you want a hot drink.  The room itself was like a box. The lights had a mind of their own. The wardrobe was a tiny cupboard with a rail and a curtain, the shower, toilets and sink were part of the room with a curtain that you could pull across privacy, nowhere to put your clothes, or hang Beautiful, quant friendly , Location is fabulous. Just Half a block off time square. Beautifully decorated. Wonderful staff. Friendly, helpful and knowledgeable  and not to hard on the eyes. This was my second time there and we are going back at the end of the month. Upon driving up, the purple and red lights on the building looked a little garish...not the best first impression.  Later in the weekend they were white which looks much classier.  Nice to have a doorman greeting us. We arrived at 10am on a Friday and were thrilled our room was ready, and no charge for checking in so early.  The room size was not bad for NYC.  We were in the \"other building.\"  The hotel is made up of 2 buildings next to each other.  We overlooked the street.  Bed very comfortable, good pillows.  Good shower.  Clean bathroom.  The bathroom is separated by a curtain (the toilet has its own door).   Not bad if you are traveling with someone you know well - a little lack of privacy if not!  But it was so nice and clean, didn\\'t bother me.  Breakfast was not much to A great hotel all round Fantastic service from the staff. Very helpful. From booking in until leaving, couldn\\'t do enough for you. Especially helpful on travel advice for getting about in the city. Johnathan and Vutha were very helpful. Our room was a great size, very clean, with maid service every day. The bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was basic but very nice. Lucky to get breakfast as a lot of hotels don\\'t offer it. Very central to Times square and 5th Avenue and most city attractions We would recommend this hotel   Great location and nicely decorated hotel. Rooms were great and spacious (for New York).  The breakfast buffet was good with tea/coffee available 24/7. The staff in particular were superb, super helpful and friendly. Leonard and Jonathan went out of their way and nothing was a bother!  We stayed for Four Nights/Five Days . The hotel is very pretty and a stones throw from Times Square. Despite being so close to the hustle and bustle of NYC you don’t hear anything. The rooms are lovely, very clean and comfortable, a little on the small side but honestly it’s not an issue. The reception and door staff are really friendly, welcoming and helpful. Breakfast was always nice, plenty of toast, fruit, cereals, snacks, tea & coffee to set you up for the day. There is also tea and coffee available in reception 24/7 which is a nice little touch. Really don’t get the negative reviews about the place. We would definitely stay here again. The rooftop bar is also a hit, great food and cocktails! Another expensive hotel booked with TUI and another disappointment! We came back at 6pm on different occasions to find our room had not been made up 😡 had to ring reception apologies made but not good enough when you’ve been out all day. Careful when you book rooms. TUI booked ours when we arrived the room was so small you had to walk around each other the wardrobe was a small hole in the wall. But the worst thing was THE SHOWER WAS ACTUALLY IN THE ROOM!!!!!! There was a curtain but everyone needs their privacy. The breakfast is very poor and very limited  For the most part, the Sanctuary Hotel was excellent. The reception staff were always helpful, and the room was lovely (small, but to be expected from a midtown New York hotel). The bed was very comfortable and we had a waterfall shower, which was great. The room was kept in a great condition during our stay. The one issue we had was that twice during our stay, on two days, we had someone come and knock on the door asking if we wanted room service. More worryingly, on the second occasion, the person knocked and then immediately unlocked the door and walked in while my partner was lying on the bed after a shower and I was in the shower - it made us wonder how many times random people had walked into our room, and left us feeling that the security was a bit lax. After all, room What can I say, our first time in NYC and we had this wonderful hotel of calm amongst the mayhem of NY but minutes from the heart of times square. The beds and pillows were super comfy and the shower was wonderful. I\\'m glad we had a door to the shower for privacy as we had our daughter travelling with us. The breakfast was continental, fresh juice, cereals, pastries, bagels, toast, avocado and boiled eggs, tea and coffee. There was plenty to choose from and was a great start to our long days out. Everyone of the staff needs to be praised for their friendliness, helpfulness and pleasant manners.  They were always saying enjoy your day, have a good day, welcome back, hope you had a nice day. It was so nice to hear. Yes you can hear noise!!! but this is the city that definitely Really nice hotel, great location right in the heart of the city. Staff were very friendly and very welcoming. Room was clean and had everything we needed. Particularly loved the shower which was fantastic. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in New York. What a great hotel. The friendly staff and excellent service add a real touch of class despite being smack bang in the heart of an area of New York not known for it’s subtlety. Close to Time Square, the location is central to all the chaos and bright lights, yet offers an oasis of calm. Never has a hotel been so appropriately named.   Particular thanks to Vichet, Delvis and the whole team of Doormen who were helpful, informative and friendly throughout our stay.  Lovley hotel, brilliant staff and amazing location. Joshua hunter a new receptionist was brilliant he was great to talk too and a credit to the hotel, thank you for giving such a great service. Other staff was brilliant too but didn’t catch their names. The rooms were lovely  The only disappointment I would give was breakfast not a lot of choice and no hot food like bacon or sausages which was a shame so wouldn’t want to include that.  But overall a great hotel and loved it.  Will defo return. The Sanctuary is certainly in a wonderful location. The hotel is convenient to all of the touristy places downtown. In addition, the staff were amazing. Joshua got us checked in quickly and saw to our needs while Leonard made sure that we found our way to our room and open the door for us as we came and went. The continental breakfast is one of the better that I’ve had, everything is very fresh nothing seems cheap or leftover. It was a very enjoyable breakfast. I was not able to take a vantage of the restaurants because we were gone from dawn to dusk. I requested a couple of things, a toothbrush, and a corkscrew that either showed up late or not at all.  The place is dark, very dark. Do not expect any light at any time of day. Even with the curtains open, it’s very dark. The Great little hotel right next to times square. There was a bit if building work going on nearby but you couldnt hear anything from within the hotel. The hotel is right next to a metro station also so was really useful. Only downside was the breakfast. Very limited options I wouldn\\'t bother paying for it and just go out. Hotel location is excellent 2 minutes walk to Times Square The Hotel is a boutique hotel and the rooms are on the small side The dining room does not have enough seats or tables this is the only real criticism  The staff were fine, we must give a special mention to the door staff, Jonathan and Vutha who were very helpful.'},\n",

The Staff are  professional and friendly especially yessica Pasquale who was a big help for me. My fight was rescheduled due to bad weather and I had to extend my stay for one more night. Good things hotels location, price and staff very freindly.  Bsd things Room very run down, air conditioning poor and room was very hot, double glazing window blown so glass was steamed up, wall paper falling off, nails sticking out window sill, bathroom mouldy, bathroom door rotten and peeling paint, rusty shower pole to name a few, double bed room very small. The complete hotel was very hot, it was like the heating was stuck on.  It's a shame as prices good, hopefully the Room was very small for two queen beds. No where to put luggage accept the floor. Water heater broke down. Had to wait for repairs to get hot water. Would not recommend. This hotel charges to much to have this type of issues. Every time I stay at The Empire Hotel it is a wonderful experience. Adam is The Best Manager! He goes above and beyond to make sure all guests are comfortable, relaxed and happy with their stay. I am a frequent goes and I am so grateful for Adam for accommodating my requests and always being so kind. Yessica is also so nice and always asks if there is anything else I need to let her know. Both Adam & Yessica are absolute Gems! I am so grateful I found this great team at The very comfortable and very lovely Empire Hotel.  Horrible, horrible, very small room: - Couldn't close the bathroom door without getting in the shower. - Window blinds very broken. - Minifridge non-functional and loud. - 1 foot clearance on one side and the foot of the bed. - Tricky to operate the HVAC system. - Very run down.  Unless you are exclusively going to performances at Lincoln Square, location is -- at best -- mediocre.  The only good thing was the staff.  Overall, far worse than a typical Manhattan hotel room in an older building. Which is reaaaallly saying something. The hotel is very well located within walking distance of Central Park, mid-town and most of NYCs attractions. The tube is nearly a few hundred yards away providing access to the wider area. Around the hotel are many great breakfast options.  The hotel itself needs upgrading. We were very concerned reading many of the reviews before arriving. We had booked several months in advance and the more recent reviews raised concerns about a lack of cleanliness. It was not as bad as we had feared but certainly, there is no attention to detail and many areas are never cleaned. We did not have any unexpected guests as many had written but can understand how this may occur. The air conditioning in our room only partially worked and was very loud creating issues with sleeping. Thankfully The Empire Hotel was a fantastic experience. Managers Adam and Erika were extremely helpful with my check in and room requests. The hotel was lovely and the housekeeping staff are amazing - a wonderful location to enjoy NYC at The Empire! NO!!!! Great location but that's where it ends...... No Room -- We had to upgrade for $50 per day to make it big enough to turn around in for two people. No room service. No Vending machines. No in-room coffee makers. No microwave. No decent thermostat setting - We stayed uncomfortably hot, even in December. No service when asked for silverware to eat food. Bottom Line: NO!!!  No.  Never again.  And we used to love this hotel.   Planned to come to the city for the opera evening at the Met and needed the place close to Lincoln center. TripAdvisor showed the perfect hotel. Except the rating was too low. Despite all odds i gave it a try…. Here is the unbiased review. +Location. The location is as good as is gets if you are planning to attend a performance at Lincoln center. The hotel is just a minute walk, literally across the road. Some  good restaurants like Bar Boloud and Boloud Sud are also a minute away, Columbus circle 5min walk, Central Park a block away, Broadway a step out. +Staff. Everyone from managers at the reception to housekeeping services were professional and helpful. No BS, no delays, everything run smoothly from check-in to check-out. +Dogs. Empire Hotel has a dog friendly policy, and Check in was great.  NIYA couldn't have been more helpful.  In fact as a return guest she was able to upgrade us to a street facing room.  Get this if you can.  Otherwise your window might open up on an airshaft.  Lobby is as great as the picture and, I hear, that the rooftop bar with small bits of food is fabulous.  Didn't go. We're not bar people.  The rooms are small.  Well it is New York.  They do need a little upgrading but comfortable.  Location is great with Lincoln Center just across the street. Downside--the evening people at the front desk didn't seem to care about the problem we were having.  Around 9:15 PM we started hearing what appeared to be drilling coming from the next room.  This was going on and off for over an hour.  I recorded the soulnd.  No one came up.  This was my third stay here and I don’t think I’ll return. The price and location are good. The housekeeper did an excellent job. On the negatives…..heating/cooling ….we switched rooms once as it was about 85 degrees. Second room was better. Mezzanine level is a furnace. Walls are paper thin so noise control is bad. No paper, pen, ice bucket, coffee in the rooms. Yes Starbucks is next door but should one have to go next door and pay $5 for coffee? No option for cold water….sometimes I saw bottled water at registration but sometimes not. The stench on some of the floors and especially the “fitness room” was horrible….like sewage….and this has been the case all three visits. The gym had no towels one visit and the water cooler is about 10 years old. Front desk pleasant enough but After we booked this hotel thru RCI we started to get worried after reading the reviews.  We were pleasantly surprised after checking in...the room was small but very comfortable and clean.  The staff was really helpful.  Nice bar on rooftop.  Great location.   Overall great value, especially considering the location directly across from Lincoln center.   We will definitely be back.  Hello! The Hotel has always been amazing..Fantastic front desk people who definitely go the EXTRA mile.. I am truly grateful. Niya and Adam are exceptional. The Hotel has a VERY cool location as well near Lincoln Center and Columbus Circle. My best, John Mathews Had a wonderful time at the Empire Hotel in NY.  Although the room was small, it was okay because I was travelling solo.  Most importantly, it was clean.  Will definitely stay there when I return to Manhattan.   Give a 5 Star rating to Ariel G for the excellent customer service he showed me during my stay.  We had a lovely time at the Empire Hotel while visiting New York.  Zee, the Bellman for much of the weekend, particularly stood out for his excellence dealing with Taxis, Valet, Traffic, Luggage and Rain. Always an outstanding experience from check in to check out! Highly recommend!! Can’t wait until our next stay!! The Empire Hotel is our go to location whenever we are in the City. The entire staff works so hard to enhance our stay. Wonderful service from Pasquale-- so welcoming and friendly! The hotel is very festive, especially as it's the holiday season. Thank you for being so accommodating. This is the perfect location on the Upper West Side right across from Lincoln Center and near Central Park. Grazie, Christina  We visited at Christmas time, choosing the Empire for its price…of course, not cheap, but reasonable for December in Manhattan!  I was afraid it might be a bit too far from the action, but the location provided us with nice walks to and from Broadway shows and mid-town sights! We never needed a cab, subway, or bus!  The staff was all around friendly and accommodating; the room small but clean with the 2 beds we requested.  There’s a lovely rooftop bar/ restaurant, open late for views of Lincoln Center ( reservations suggested, but they try to accommodate walk-ins.). There’s a Starbucks on the first floor of the building, so we ordered breakfast online, picked it up and enjoyed in the lovely hotel lobby.  We could not have enjoyed our stay more! Excellent hotel with a superb staff. Shout out to Samantha and Steven, who went above and beyond to ensure my family had an excellent experience. Would definetely recommend this hotel to everybody! A true sample of excellent hospitality.  It’s a shame that a hotel with such a great location is so poorly run. I checked into my first room and the door was open, blinds broken. After calling down to the front desk, I was given a new and bigger room, which I appreciated. However the AC unit in this new room was broken. It could not keep a cool temperature all night, and made a lot of noise while it was at it. After a bad night’s sleep I asked the front desk to take a look while I was out.  When I returned that night, I didn’t see any indication anyone had fixed the unit, but waited to see if the unit functioned more normally. It did not. When I asked the front desk about this the following morning, they told me someone had indeed visited the room and it turned out the unit was not easily fixable. No one told me this, We were dealing with a nightmare Airbnb situation and reached out late one evening to the Empire Hotel for a 2am rescue.  Niya, Tyra and Erica Kostic saved our vacation!  Look no further than the Empire Hotel for top of the line service and accommodations...they really know how to take care of their guests! The one personal touch in the one-night stay was an earnest bell-man named Zee. But the bed was very comfortable and the location is incredible convenient if you like to be in the Lincoln Center hub - street noise is inevitable. We asked for a quiet room, which might have been impossible, but the convenience is great. Ariel and D'Angeli and Christian were amazing! I had never felt more welcome - I really love this hotel! The lobby has a great vibe and I love how spacious the rooms are - Definitely get a King Size bed - the beds are to die for! Wonderful location, but rooms are in poor condition.  The curtains were torn and not functioning and it was impossible to control the thermostat.  It was unbearably hot for the two nights that we stayed. The only redeeming feature is the convenient location to Lincoln Center.   Overpriced for this facility. We had a great and comfortable stay. It’s perfect for an evening when you going to the Opera or Ballet or a show at Lincoln Center. We had a couple of minor issues that got handled well. Hotel manager, Maggie and Bell staffer, Lee were wonderful in handling everything. Thank you!  Was here for WOBI 2023. Only booked this hotel as it was the conference hotel for WOBI. Otherwise, I would have gone to one of my gotos.  SHAME on WOBI for picking this hotel. This is supposed to be a high-end conference, and while it is next to Lincoln Centre, it just doesn't meet any standards. While the staff is lovely and the location is wonderful, as others have noted it just doesn't meet standards. Main issues:  1. The heating/cooling system and LOUD and half works.  2. Smelly showers. 3. Pillow had stains on it! Do I need to go on?  This hotel has so much potential but they need a major investment. The lobby is so much better than the rooms themselves. They were tiny (to be expected, it’s New York) but they were really dated. It was freezing and I couldn’t make the heater work in the room (it was super old and the knob was turned on but nothing happened). Worn down furniture. No coffee in room, but honestly I was happy to have an excuse to leave to the Starbucks around the corner. Despite a great location and welcoming staff, I was truly disappointed in my stay at the Empire. The lobby and rooftop bar/pool are lovely, but once I stepped into my room, it was clear it had not been maintained and were in desperate need of a refresh.  I’m used to small NYC hotel rooms, but this was extreme. I could barely maneuver around my bed and with the door shut in the bathroom, I could not even turn around. Curtains were dusty, the carpet was hard, even the iron was rusty. Peeling wallpaper, water stains, woodwork that looked like it had been chewed on completed the look. Despite a thermostat, I did not have control over the heat and my room was consistently 80 degrees, with the window open.  My room key was also demagnetized 4x in 2 days. Reception told me not to put I read reviews beforehand so went into our stay with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Yes, the rooms and bathrooms are very small, but our family of four didn’t feel cramped since we spent very limited time in the room. The beds were firm and standard size for a double bed, the room was clean, the window shades were fully functional. My only complaint was that our 11th floor room was extremely hot (due to heat rising from the other rooms, because it was cold outside) and would not cool down below 76 despite having the A/C set on 65 (the lowest setting). I requested a high floor for the view so didn’t complain, but if we ever stayed here again, I would request a lower floor for sure. The staff was amazing- everyone we interacted with was helpful and kind. Stayed here five years ago and enjoyed it but the property has obviously been in decline since. At my recent stay in room 140 it is showing significant signs of wear - the door latch was snapped off, paint was chipped throughout and the window blinds didn’t operate.   The entry card stopped working multiple times and check in seem perplexed as to which room to put me in. While this hotel is in a good location, until the maintenance is improved I suggest it is avoided as there are better properties at a similar price point nearby. I had planned the perfect weekend for my wife and myself.  I had booked a corner suite at The Empire Hotel back in the spring.  I had called the hotel directly several times before arriving, checking to see that we had the corner suite.  I called the day before and was told the suite was ours.  My wife and I arrive on Friday afternoon ontly to be told the suite was not available and that they would downgrade me with a junior suite.  I had no options.  Where would you go on a weekend in Manhattan and find a good room?  The front desk was stoic.  I'm sure they were very well trained at fielding problems--I should have heeded the 1 star reviews of this hotel.  So, we get our room, with 2 beds, and a heat problem.  Mind you, it is 40 degrees outside, yet our room was 80 when we The front desk clerk Samantha at the Empire Hotel epitomizes exceptional customer service, seamlessly blending professionalism with genuine warmth. Their attentiveness and efficiency contribute to a delightful experience, complementing the hotel's luxurious ambiance. Together, they create a memorable stay that leaves guests feeling valued and well-cared-for. Perfect location  to visit the MET. The staff was absolutely super. TV and bed were fine. But pretentious Art Deco décor .. that is a bit overwhelming in the small rooms and narrow hall ways.   And Beware .. there no food or drink, except bottled water, available in the entire place.  If you want coffee in the AM, you have to get up, get dressed and go stand in line next door at the Starbucks.  It might be helpful to announce that ahead of time to potential guests, so they can at least decide on bringing their own instant coffee packets. This fact alone prevents me from ever booking that hotel again  My girlfriends and I stayed here for 4 nights.  I was a little concerned about the negative reviews but all of us were extremely pleased with the location, price and condition of the hotel.  We had great service with the staff and would definitely stay here again. From check in with the delightful D’Angeli, to checkout 4 days later, our experience staying at The Empire Hotel NYC was perfect! From the room with a view of Lincoln Center and 2 lovely windows to look out at the city below, the comfy bed and just right pillows, and the friendly housekeeping services, all hotel services were excellent.   All personnel at this hotel provided friendly and considerate service from greetings upon entrance and exits , to advise on nearby places to grab breakfast, we always felt welcome.   The lobby with its beautiful Art Deco black and white furnishings is a lovely place to wait for friends, as well.   One tiny thing that would be nice is either daily coffee service in the lobby for those of us that skip breakfast but need that extra boost while I worked directly with the hotel on a large event and when I say the hotel management and front desk staff went above and beyond to make sure our guests were taken of--I truly mean it. Carl, Erica, Adam, and Chris--incredible hotel management and sales team. And the front desk staff was superb--Daniel and Ariel have so much patience and grace when dealing with obstacles. All my thanks to the hotel team!  The public areas, like the lobby and rooftop lounge, have very chic decor and seem to be maintained nicely. The rooms however are dingy. There were shoddy repairs and beat up furnishings in the room. The shower head was held together with duct tape, the paint is chipped and walls were stained. If I were to rate the room alone it would get 2 stars.   My experience with the hotel staff was wonderful though. The front desk agents, the bellman and the rooftop bar staff were all very kind and helpful. We had multiple situations where they went out of their way to offer us help. Each went above and beyond and made our trip extra special.    It was a rocky start until I spoke with Samantha at guest services who quickly and graciously assisted with my request. Thank you so much! I'm relieved there is a superb level of customer service once you find the right person to help! My room was comfortable but small. Great view of Lincoln Center and further north. I was there for the Met Opera and location could not have been better. There was a bit of pandemonium in the hotel because of the NY Marathon. On balance, a good thing, the runners and their families were a plus. And the desk staff were friendly and helpful, Hello Ariel!   Some negatives. Nearby restaurants are crowded and expensive. No room service. No breakfast. The next door restaurant is crazy noisy dark at dinner time.\"},\n",

Love the decor too (nice art, wall paper, tiles) .. sometimes new and interesting. You can actually see some attractions within walking distance, so a big plus Beautiful new hotel in this area. I travel to NYC office few times a month and so far this hotel is up to my expectations. Rooms are clean, good size (space for you luggage ) has a working desk as well. I love how modern their bathrooms are, always filled with deferent size towels and smells nice.  The staff is really friendly and they aways try to go out of their way to accommodate me with my requests ( I always ask for higher floor room ). This is my TO GO hotel in NYC! Stefany made our stay exceptional! We felt so comfortable and welcomed here. We enjoyed it so much we extended our stay! The rooms are beautiful and clean and in an amazing location! We will most definitely come back for another stay!  Best Hotel in the Financial District area!! New hotel with very clean rooms, the sleep quality very to my expectations! I liked the second floor lobby (more like a meeting space) when I was able to make my calls and have privacy while waiting for my flight later that day. I would come back again since this property was everything that a corporate traveler needs. Absolutely amazing place to stay.   I would highly suggest.  The staff is amazing and they are so polite.  Great location.  Love this place.  I will say the rooms are perfect for someone traveling in town! The best hotel bed I ever slept in!!! I travel for work to NYC very often since after the pandemic and I have stayed at few deferent hotels. I booked 3 night stay last month and I am back this months again. I love the hotel! SUPER CLEAN, NEW BUILDING! I felt like no one ever stayed in the room before me. Very modern design, has a touch of luxury and sophistication which you won\\'t see the same in the area. I needed extra towels in the room, I got it just few min delivered. Thank you FIDI Team for the complimentary upgraded room, delusions morning coffee and your hospitality !  Very nice vibe and close distance to lots of things.  Parking was a bit far but that is just how NYC is so it was fine. Decor was great, not the biggest rooms but have more than what we needed.  Very clean and I love the showers. Only complaint is counter space in bathroom and the room lighting is a bit dim for make up.  Love how the rooms are not close to each other and basically you have your own elevator.  The women at the check in desk were SO nice and helpful and just great.  I will def stay here again, highly recommend.  Excellent hotel right in downtown manhattan, close to 2 subway stations and walking distance from many must see attractions whilst in new york, staff was friendly, helpful and just excellent service.   The rooms are on the small side but considering it is in the heart of manhattan not surprising. Not the greatest view (directly across from another hotel, so just buildings on every side), but despite this a short walk about 10mins either direction gets you to all the sightseeing attractions.  My first time in new york and also first review as an independent travel agent, I will definitely be recommending as somewhere to stay if travelling solo or a couple, and a recommendation for anyone visiting new york and wanting to stay in the manhattan area.  They also had great My Team and I stayed at the Fidi hotel last week due to few meetings we had to attend in the area. The booking process was simple (not a 20 pages on agreement like we normally get) and the staff was very helpful with last min changes (we had add people, some did not make it). Friendly staff, very nice and clean hotel.  Nice little hotel in the Financial District. It\\'s was my first time staying that area and when looking on Booking.com, most hotels had a high-ranking rates that is hard to afford these days. The FIDI Hotel had a reasonable rate and I\\'m glad I pick that one. My room was big size, a lot of space for my suitcases, yoga mat and many shopping bags :) The staff is friendly, recommended me local places to eat and find my way in the city. One evening a did not know how the turn on the TV and I called the reception for assistance, a engineering manager showed up in less than 5 min to assist me. The look of the hotel is very modern and elegant, very nice music in the public area and very nice sent as well. Their lobby is on the second floor with a nice balcony to enjoy a morning coffee.  This past week I stayed at The FIDI Hotel due to Fashion Week in NYC. My Team and I had 7 rooms at a different hotel (won\\'t mention the name here) and had a first terrible night. My assistant was looking for hotels in the area the next morning and she was able to secure the last min move of the group at this hotel. The staff was amazing and very helpful, we got help with our equipment to be stored in a safe room (we check in very late due to the show). The next day we asked if our rooms can be cleaned in certain time and we were accommodated. The Housekeeping Manager sent us an email to confirm with us that the rooms are taken care of.  The hotel is brand new and very sophisticated, large rooms with sound proof windows. The only thing was no restaurant on property, but we were I have been staying at this hotels for few times now in the past 2 months. My corporate is part of their corporate program (great % off and complimentary amenities). The Agents are very nice and welcoming, I meet the GM at their complimentary welcome drink event on a Friday and felt very welcomed from her as well. The rooms are very nice size, cozy, very confutable bed and very peaceful. The bathroom appliances are high end and very large size for a hotel especially in NYC. Last thing I would say is, the hotel rooms are clean. Nothing beats clean room!! My co workers and I will continue staying here for all of our future travels. What you CAN Expect;  Loud, annoying music outside upon arrival.  Overworked, unhappy desk clerks.  No Lobby.   SMALL, cramped  rooms even for NYC.  Not being informed over our 4 day stay, that here actually is a sort of public space to gather on the 2nd floor (we stayed 4 days and never had a clue, so no review possible).  What you DON\\'T GET;  a CLOSET in the smallest rooms- there were a few hooks on the wall instead.  DRAWERS to put clothing in.  A CHAIR to perhaps sit down in to tie your shoes (there is no room). SHELVES of any kind, even in the Bathroom ( so put your electric styling tools in the sink as advised by the warning labels on them).  No views.  No amenities like a magnifying mirror.  No bulk products like shampoo, lotion (individual bars of soap and only  small We really enjoyed our stay at the FIDI Hotel. Not only the room was great (stylish, beautiful bathroom with spacious shower, very comfortable bed) but the location and the neighbourhood were awesome too with lots of nice restaurants and bars and the subway station right there.  Another really cool surprise was that on Fridays and Saturdays there is free wine and cheese at the hotel bar :)   Also worth to mention: Before booking our stay, I have recognized a lot of negative comments about the size of the room in many reviews out there. Now that I have stayed at the FIDI I can tell that the rooms are big enough. Yes, they are not huge, but even though we had quite a lot of luggage there was enough space for all of it and for us to still feel comfortable.   I would definitely book A very nice boutique hotel in FIDI with a friendly and willing to be of help staff. The rooms are a bit bigger and certainly nicer than the area chain hotels. Also this hotel has much nicer/larger bathrooms and rooms are very clean. I liked being in the noisy NYC and still be in a quiet room and have a good night sleep. A great new hotel in the FiDi. I have been traveling to the area for bossiness meetings for the past 2 years. I did stayed in two other hotels but I felt like a needed a change. I stayed at The Fidi Hotel for one week and I never booked another hotel since early June. Everything it\\'s brand new, the room smelled like new. Very nice rooms sizes for NYC, enough space for your belongings and actually room for morning yoga too. It\\'s important for me to me to have a nice and large room especially when traveling for a week at the time.  The service is AMAZING!!! The agents are so helpful and pleasant and they already greet me by my name, you can\\'t ask for more. The Fidi is my new home away from home! A great hotel that I recommend if you want to be in a good location in Lower Manhattan yet with very convenient transportation to all parts of the city. Chose to stay at this hotel for 4 nights together with my 13 year old son precisely because we wanted to be away from the hustle and bustle of the busy places but still have convenient transportation to visit museums and other attractions.  The hotel is very nice, with modern and clean rooms. The staff are extremely polite, responsive and willing to help, especially Yovan and Aliyah - thank you!  Best regards, Tsveta & Kiril I have mixed feelings. lots of great things about this place, others not so great. The nice things to say are about the spacious rooms (NYC standard) the fact that its still new and clean, maintained well. Excellent location near almost all subway lines. Very reasonable price. comfortable bed. Not so great - No place to sit in lobby, a lounge in 2nd floor that still had no food or drink service (expected to change ) and very little sitting place. What I really did not like was a NO FLEXABILITY WHAT SO EVER on late check out, most places I stayed with, will at least make some effort to offer some kind of late checkout as a service.  Had a forced two day stay by Delta Airlines when our connecting flight home was cancelled, I found the FIDI through my Southwest app. As all the airport hotels had raised their prices to gouge the people who had their flights cancelled, this hotel was reasonable enough in cost that it was more than worth the $100 can ride to and from JFK. The hotel and rooms were typical New York. The building is tall and the rooms small. The bathroom was modern, the bed comfy and everything was clean. The difference was their people and why I give it a five. The day desk clerk was JoVan and I wish I new the late night gentleman\\'s name. Both were very pleasant, helpful, and fun to engage with. Everyone was awesome and quick to help. It is because of the staff that I give the a 5.  Date of stay: As expected, small room, no where to sit  Except for the bed.  Cleaning is non existent unless you ask.    While waiting in the lobby or out front, not a bench or seat in site (there are plenty of spaces for one or more)except stairs. We did enjoy the bar and outdoor area on the second floor and food coffe and wine/chesese on weekends. Please consider not using small plastic tubes for shampoo/soap.  We used bout 15 for our 4 night stay.  The hotel suggests  “to protect the environment by not offering daily bedding change unless requested”. Great, I’m good with that, but take that a step further with refillable containers and recycle Cans in rooms. ~$35 extra was charged per night upon checkout. It wasn\\'t mentioned anywhere while booking. At $125 a night, that means our price went up almost 30%. I found this extremely distasteful. Otherwise actually nice, though the rooms are small. Pros: New hotel Clean and nice basic rooms Umbrella in the room Near subway  Cons: Beside a weed shop, you\\'ll smell Marijuana when you go out the hotel When we checked out and left the hotel, received a charge on my card for almost $35 per night. This was not indicated upon booking and was not informed upon check in. When you check in they would place a hold on your card for $100 per night for incidentals but don\\'t inform you about the additional fees. You would think you would get a great deal based on the price when you book but you\\'ll get blindsided by the additional fees on your card when you leave the hotel.  Our experience was absolutely wonderful from the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out. The hotel is new and modern, so everything feels very fresh which I loved, as well as being super clean. Every staff member we encountered from maintenance to front desk to security were absolutely lovely. We enjoyed coming in each day and talking with Ben at the front desk about our plans and where we had explored, he was so knowledgable and had some great recommendations for us, as well as being so friendly and warm, thank you for your hospitality Ben!   The location is perfect, the subway is very close and you can get to so many different neighbourhoods in a matter of minutes, as well as Brooklyn being a short subway ride away too. It’s a short walk to the Oculus and Ground From the moment we arrived at the hotel, we already loved it and it set high expectations in our minds, all of which were met and more. The hotel staff was all incredibly personable, kind, and solution-oriented for all my accommodation requests when I decided to extend and upgrade my stay to another room. It was the perfect hotel for my partner and me to disappear together into a beautiful corner of NYC. This is a brand-new entity, having opened in March of 2023, and there are some quizzical decisions in the rooms. The use of confined space is baffling -- I understand that Manhattan doesn\\'t give you a lot of play when building something of this size, but there isn\\'t enough room to turn, or to keep two suitcases near to bedside. Why are the beds not tall enough to slide your baggage beneath? Why is there zero shelf space in the bathroom for even a modicum of toiletries? Why did housekeeping not vacuum or replenish toilet paper supplies most days? Why were the walls paper-thin, so much so that the loud sound of rutting intruded on us from a couple down the hall? The price was right for nine days, but there were some things we had to figure on doing without. Credit: We needed an The hotel is in a perfect location for  everything you need, bars, resturants, subway, shops. Also great service. Must say, Angelika was one of the best person I’ve met in hospitality! So professional but yet such a great and fun person to be around! Would definitely stay there again! Brand new hotel… which is great if you want something clean and new. I booked a Superior King room, it was - without question, the SMALLEST hotel room I’ve ever stayed in. The room did not match the photo, I had no room to actually open my suitcases. It pretty much just fit the bed and two side tables. I suspect this was a standard full room with a king size bed. All of the rooms are extremely dark - as both sides face large office buildings. The location is great in terms of accessibility to subways and attractions, but the neighborhood is OFFICE buildings. There is no bar/restaurant/mini fridge or coffee machine. They do however charge you a $40 resort fee for 2 bottles of water/day and wifi. Crazy.  The front desk staff was friendly and the hotel is very clean.  Extremely small room, not as described in booking.com, no closet, no chair, no table, nothing to store luggage. Very poor reaction by staff. Insisted on charging us while we needed to find another hotel (traveling with family and luggage). Very rude staff behind the counter. In the end the manager helped us out, took us an hour all in all. First off let me start by saying the hotel is a chic, cheap get away. The front of the hotel gives we\\'re here but you can\\'t see us. They have the option of taking the elevator or the stairs. Fun Fact I was told by Miguel while getting help with my luggage \"that the stairs were built to avoid a disaster like Sandy.\\' That was Genius. It was pretty busy at the time I came in and the agents were a little overwhelmed, but I saw staff come from everywhere and  help with luggage and help with assisting to go to the bar. I came for my anniversary and was acknowledged by the Housekeeping Director that they left us a surprise in the room. We checked into 1902 and let me tell you that the room was WOW. They made a couple of swans out of towels. Omg they had eyes and lashes. They had rose We had a great stay at The Fidi Hotel last week! We booked online for a last minute work/play trip and we saw it was brand new- it looked great in the photos but was better in person! So cool and hip! Here are the highlights:  The Staff:  Wonderful check-in experience. I was welcomed by Angelo who was really greate. He the area and was kind and attentive. We hadn\\'t stayed in the financial district before. At check out we were helped by Angelica- she stored our bags for us and gave us a great suggestion for lunch.  The Room: WOW. Floor to ceiling windows, which made the room so bright and airy. There was some noise from the street- but it is NYC so it was expected. We brought our earplugs! The bathroom was on the small side but the shower pressure was fantastic. There was a Visited NYC for business and took a room at the FIDI for the convenience of location. Cleanliness and efficiency are most important to me as a frequent traveller. The hotel is flawless in this. I was not disappointed at this brand spanking new venue and will be glad to rebook next time I\\'m in town.  I had the pleasure of staying at The Fidi in the first week in April- and I was so happy that I did. I planned a special getaway for my girlfriend and I and needed help with some restaurant recommendations and things to do in the city.  Ibrahim called me a few days before my arrival to see if there was anything special that I needed- which was a great touch (and time saver!) Their restaurant is not open yet, but the Front Desk told me at check in that as a guest I had special discounts and the restaurants on the block- we tried two of the three for lunch each day and the food was great. They gave me great suggestions for dinner spots too! The room was spacious and very clean and every time we walked in or out of the building the staff greeted us by name- this was very impressive I found a great rate for this hotel online and took a chance- I was not disappointed! The staff told me that they opened recently and I was one of their first guests! My room was on the small side but had everything I needed- fast wifi, big TV and comfy bed. I was in town on some last minute business so I\\'m glad that I found this place to stay. The hotel was really cool- good music in the lobby and when I wasn\\'t in my room there is a great lounge on the second floor. The front desk staff told me that they are opening their bar soon and will offer breakfast too. I\\'ll definitely be back. Also the location is unbeatable- close to subway lines and great options around the neighborhood. Honest Review:   Cleanliness - room was clean except lack of ventilation unless you open the window. If you’re asthmatic or have allergies, bring your own towels.   Room Size - were not that tall but the size of the room is smaller than the average room in Europe. Not acceptable for the price paid. Got bruises from accidentally hitting the table and the bed. Room is only good for 1 person.  Also, even if we wanted to call for room cleaning, we opt not to coz our luggages occupied the floor area.   Location - not ideal, far from the the main attractions. If you could get the same price or if you’re willing to add couple of $$$, better get somewhere in central.  This is our main regret staying in Manhattan is choosing FIDI hotel. No restaurants near the area that open late in the 1* to customer service and comfort   1/ No cups in the shower. They forget to change the shower utensils. No coffee pot.  Wifi does not work properly.  TV not at all.   2/ Rooms are very small (pay attention to the size when you choose the room) but they lie about it anyway.   3/ They update their website to put different information everyday that does not correspond to the day before. Thinking you are an idiot and won’t notice.   4/ They charge resort fees for water and they don’t even bring the new water bottles but instead fill the used bottles up with tap water.  Thinking you are an idiot and won’t notice.   5/ Worst of all is the Customer Service is very low level especially for New York City.  “0” class and no curtesy as they are lying to you all the time.  Again,  We had such an amazing time staying at the fidi hotel. The staff was friendly and the hotel was clean. We can’t wait to stay again; hopefully the restaurant will be open then. This will definitely be our go to hotel in NYC.'},\n",

I would definitely stay there again on my next trip to Paris. Merci!! Highly recommend this hotel and we would absolutely stay here again if we need to be in this area of Paris.  This is a reasonably priced \"4-star\" boutique hotel.  The rooms were very clean and neat, the bed was comfortable, and the other amenities were a nice touch (complimentary water, soft drinks, coffee, tea, bath robes, bath slippers).  The hotel is in a safe and convenient location.  Easy 10-15 min. walk to the Louvre, Place Vendome, and the Seine.  Several different metro lines are within a 5-10 min. walk. Bistros/restaurants with assorted cuisines and cafes are all within blocks.  The block where the hotel is located is surrounded by busy areas so it can get a little noisy.  The rooms are equipped with noise dampening windows, so the rooms were very quiet and peaceful.  Good central location - close to Metro and many attractions.  Probably the most helpful staff I have encountered in any hotel and very easy to engage with.  We stayed in a \"Privilege\" room which was quite generously sized - bigger than I expected it to be for Paris.  Free mini-bar and self-serve snack bar downstairs with coffee machine and refreshments. Lovely staff. All were good, and Manon was outstanding. Stephanie manages a good team. Nice breakfast and a handy free snack bar in the afternoons. . The location on border of 1e and 2e arrondissements is superb. It is Walkable to many attractions, but even if it were not, I would choose it again. Excellent hotel all round.  Ideal location for The Louvre, city centre shops, and plenty of metro stations within a few minutes walk to get to other areas of Paris.  There is no restaurant for evening meals and lunch and no bar in the hotel but that doesn\\'t matter as there are numerous restaurants and cafes close by so you don\\'t have to go far to eat out.  Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and they were all so polite and helpful.  The room was very comfortable.  The bed was as good as you could wish for and the en-suite bathroom had plenty of room.  The room and the hotel in general was spotlessly clean.  A nice touch was the mini bar fridge with soft drinks and water in the room at no extra charge, as was the food buffet with hot drinks and soft drinks that was From start to finish this hotel was superb. Check in was quick and easy, I\\'d asked for rooms close together as I was travelling with my daughters and they did this. They also surprised us with a bottle of champagne for my daughters birthday.  The staff are so helpful and smiley and breakfast was delicious.  The hotel is really  well placed to explore Paris  on foot and they also made some great restaurant recommendations. I\\'d certainly stay here again! My friend and I spent five nights at Hotel Malte over Christmas this past December and had a lovely experience. The staff is very friendly, the rooms are clean and well appointed, and the complementary snacks and soft drinks are appreciated. Also, you can show your key card at any of the other Astotel hotel properties in Paris to use their facilities, restrooms, and snacks. We found the hotel to be a great value for the price and will definitely look to return. The service was excellent and the rooms were very clean  We enjoyed staying here  We will come back for sure !!! Whenever we come back to Paris which is often  Great location in the city !! Wish them the best !!! Brilliant hotel, clean, comfortable, great location just a short walk to the Louvre. The open bar in the afternoon is fantastic, we could refresh with coffee and pastries throughout the day at any of their locations, which is such a brilliant idea. Staff were friendly and welcoming. Cannot fault the hotel in any way.  I typically only write reviews when hotels are amazing or awful, most are “fine” but when it gets the extremes, I feel compelled to share.  This hotel is awesome!  I’ve stayed in many Parisian hotels over many years and I’d say that the accommodations are fairly typical of the hotel class BUT it’s the staff that make this place stand out!!   Kudos to this establishment for the level of service provided by every staff member (front desk, housekeeper, restaurant all excellent). Great location- definitely my new “go to” for Paris. Perfect hotel with amazing staffs, all good rooms, great breakfast and perfect location. Walkable to all spot like louvre, 30min to Concorde and so on with lot of multi cusine restaurants around. Loved it. Super helpful staff. Nice lobby. Super helpful staff. Would definitely stay here again. Super close to the louvre as well as a short walk to the arc de triomphe. Coffee available 24/7 in the lobby. Snacks, water, soda available in the afternoons. Hotel  Malte is in the heart of Paris,  very quiet and the hospitality  is just wow...    My  wife and I  arrived in the late night of December 23rd, at the reception we met a by named Amadu,  the warm reception was beyond words ... we felt comfortableband safe, being out  first time in Paris!  The breakfast was  delicious and the environment very clean and workers are ready to help you at all the times.  The rooms are heaven on earth,the beds are  very comfortable ! This hotel is one of the most astonishing hotel I come across. This hotel is on great location and one should stay to get the feel of it. Totally recommend for their hospitality and food is also delicious.  Escape the norm of cramped, tired hotels and be treated to something extraordinary at Hôtel Malte Astotel. Just minutes away from the Louvre Museum, this hotel is perfect for budget-conscious travelers. The staff is incredibly friendly and always ready to assist with tour planning. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, complete with a charming balcony and a quintessential view of Paris\\' iconic Haussmann-style buildings. And the best part? Enjoy complimentary drinks, cakes, and snacks in the lobby from evening until midnight, as well as a free minibar. Plus, access to these amenities extends to other Astotel hotels throughout the city. They even surprised us with a bottle of Champagne and snacks one evening! If a trip to Paris is on your horizon, book this fantastic hotel We returned to the Hotel Malte in early December after our experience in a previous stay in Paris. We highly recommend this hotel; pleasant rooms, great breakfast, and a caring supportive staff - the people make this a great hotel stay! A nice boutique hotel on a quiet street, at easy walking distance to the Louvre, Tuileries, Palais Royal and Opera Garnier. Small but comfortable rooms that are well outfitted with modern bathrooms.  Front desk staff are very helpful. Breakfast has a variety of options for people with different tastes. Free snacks and drinks in the lobby from 2 pm till 2 am are a nice bonus. The area has several restaurants and cafes.  If possible, I would choose a room on the second floor (American third floor) or above. The rooms on the first floor (American second floor) are not the quietest for light sleepers or those who like to sleep in, as you hear the sounds from the lobby and the dining area downstairs. Hotel Malte Astotel in Paris is a true gem. The sophisticated decor, impeccable service, and central location create a delightful stay. The rooms are a blend of comfort and style, and the attention to detail is remarkable. A perfect choice for those seeking a touch of Parisian luxury. My wife stayed for 1 night. She loved so much. The employees treated my wife kindly and She thanked especially to Princesse so much to be insterested very well. The place was so clean and warm. Also the room was which she expected. The price of the hotel is fare A wonderful hotel in a fabulous location. Staff impeccably friendly and helpful. Wonderful breakfast, as well as afternoon and evening tea and coffee, and snacks available. The room was perfect; well appointed and super comfortable. I very highly recommend Hotel Malte for a lovely Parisian séjour!  I was greeted warmly by the friendly staff. The breakfast buffet offered a wide variety of delicious options to suit every taste. The location was convenient, with easy access to local attractions and transportation.Overall, Hôtel Malte offered a truly pleasant experience from the moment we stepped into the reception until our departure. The personnel were exceptionally friendly and service-minded. Our room was very clean and tidy. The breakfast selection was impressive by French standards, featuring excellent coffee and cheese.  The \\'all-inclusive\\' bar and minibar were perfect for juice, sodas, and water. However, regarding alcoholic beverages, there was no selection available. This was not an issue, though, as wines and beers are easily obtainable from Carrefour Cité, just a minute\\'s walk from the hotel entrance.  In terms of location, the hotel was situated in a nice, quiet area with a bus stop nearby. It\\'s just a 5-minute walk to the closest metro station.  And did I mention the staff? (Yes, I This is a comfortable, clean and friendly hotel in a great location for sightseeing, shopping and restaurants. All the staff provided excellent service at all times. Just be aware that the rooms are quite small. Highly recommended. Too long; Didn’t read: If you’re looking for a nice, comfy boutique hotel, this hotel is the perfect option, as long as you don’t mind the smaller rooms.  This hotel is one hidden gem. While a lot of attention is given to more popular brand hotels, this hotel is simply amazing and should deserve more attention. I have never had such a deep, good night sleep, having slept for more than 10.5 hours the first night and for every other night I didn’t want to get out of bed. The staff are very friendly and so charming, always smiling and very sweet. Everything was very clean, and while the hotel room is small, it’s super cozy and relaxing, rather than it being claustrophobic, at least for me. I also enjoyed the complimentary buffet offered from 2 PM to 2 AM.    It’s really hard to The Hotel Location is perfect for Shopping and Sightseeing. The staff is very very friendly. Free soft drinks are included in the Room Rate. It was a perfect stay. The bathroom is clean. We had a room a street side, but it was very OK for sleeping. Staff and room was fantastic! Will stay there again. I asked for a room change based on my mistake in booking and they bent over backwords to accomodate me. Food was good, room was clean. the hotel is beautiful! This boutique hotel exceeded our expectations in every way.  We were early for check-in but they took all of our information anyway and placed our luggage in storage.  The front desk personnel (Princess and another young lady) were simply engaging and gave us directions to every place imaginable in the area.   Snacks and drinks available in the lobby pretty much all day. Breakfast was way more than I\\'ve seen a hotel give and it was delicious.  The rooms are so quaint, beds are comfortable and the whole ambiance makes you feel like you\\'re in Paris.  The location was near many points of interest.  I am recommending this hotel to everyone that says they are travelling to Paris.  We\\'ll be back!! Our first trip to Paris was amazing! The Hotel Astotel Malte did an excellent job making our experience superb! The greeting, information, and hospitality were 5 star service! The room was amazing and we got an upgrade to our surprise! Can’t beat the location close to the Louvre! I can\\'t say enough about this fantastic hotel!  #1 hotel ranking in Paris is very well deserved!  When we booked, we mentioned that we were coming to Paris to celebrate our daughter’s 18th birthday. As a surprise for her (and to us as well!), they left a wonderful arrangement of balloons on her bed (she was thrilled!), as well as macaroons and champagne for us later in the day. Such a nice touch!   Breakfast service was impeccable with many delicious offerings! Staff is absolutely first class with their hospitality!   Great location! In addition, it was a really nice feature to be able to stop in at other Astotel hotels during the day for a bathroom break and refreshments. It was fun to see how different each one was designed/decorated! Though I will say that Malte is our This hotel is the best. All the staff of lobby desk and restaurant do their best. Thank you for them. Especially Anastasiia,  thank you. The Louvre Museum and Musee de l\\'Orangerie are really close. You can walk to the Eiffel or take the Metro all at once. I love the dust-free shiny bathroom, the breakfast with fresh orange juice and bread (you can steam your eggs), the free snack bar in the lobby all afternoon when you come for a short break, and the staff\\'s kind and precise handling of the work.   (The room was the lowest grade, so it was small, but if you want a room with a large room, book a room with a higher grade.) On arrival we were warmly greeted by the staff at reception. Bedroom spacious, spotless with large, fluffy bathrobes and towels. Breakfast included a wide selection of everything one could wish for.   Hotel staff were so courteous and helpful and went out of their way to make our stay easy and special. Nothing was too much trouble. Strongly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to experience a really enjoyable and affordable stay in Paris. Hotel is also very well located. Hotel is very comfortable and clean in a good location. Staff extremely helpful and welcoming. Breakfasts varied with plenty of healthy options and a great selection of bread and pastries. Hospitality is really lovely with a free refreshment buffet all day. Overall a very pleasant place to stay on a Paris city tour.  Beautiful hotel! Close to the Tuileries Christmas Market -  15 min walk and same distance or less to the Louvre and many shopping places.  The staff was amazing, water and other refreshments were always waiting in my room. Breakfast was a plus - worth the additional cost. Hope to return again! 🇫🇷❤️ Great hotel and outstanding customer service!  We were in Paris to experience the Christmas markets, tourist attractions and as a gift for my daughter\\'s birthday.  The staff made the experience that much more enjoyable as they decorated her bed with colorful balloons and decorations along with an assortment of Macaron\\'s.  Little things such as that go a long way.  The unlimited room \"mini bar\" is a great concept as we always had plenty of water, juices, soft drinks and tea and coffee anytime we needed it.  We also enjoyed the ability to stop at other Astotel brands during our exploration of Paris - a very nice perk! That benefit allowed us to take a break and recharge at various spots near places like the Arc de Triomphe and Sacred Heart Basilica before heading back out on our Staff is friendly and very accommodating. Room was clean and comfortable but a bit stuffy in winter although I am a fresh air fanatic and appreciate hot showers (steam with no ventilation in bathroom). Location is awesome. Safe and 10 minute walk to a lot including louvre, Angelina’s, great restaurants and bistros. The staff recommendations were superb. We really appreciated the snacks and breakfast. Also umbrellas snd the fact that you can find any Astotel in town and show your room key they will help you out. I’d stay here again! Very nice and central located hotel in the middle of Paris. The room furniture is a mixture of traditional and modern style, the mini bar is included in the price. The whole staff was very friendly and accommodating. Will try to come again ... Absolutely fantastic experience overall! The staff was delightful, the rooms were exceptionally comfortable, and the amenities provided an extra touch of luxury. I highly recommend this hotel; it truly elevated my trip and left me with unforgettable memories. Charming and wonderful hotel in rue de Richelieu. Excellent staff - friendly and helpful. Rooms are clean. Quick check-in and out. Clean rooms. Close to the Louvre museum and other areas of interest. Paris is a walking city but lots of taxis and Uber available. Very good breakfast and free snacks from 2:00 pm onwards, all kinds of nice restaurants nearby.  Wanted to spend our 30th anniversary in Paris and booked a hotel thru booking.com.  Saw the Hotel Malte on TripAdvisor and cancelled our other hotel and booked Hotel Malte based on the reviews.   What a great decision.  Mentioned our anniversary when I booked and when we returned to the room on the big day we were met with a bottle of champagne on ice and some snacks with a card wishing us a Happy Anniversary.  That was just one of the five great days.  Each day we were greeted with a smile and good morning then a great breakfast.  Each evening when we returned another cheerful greeting.  The free mini bar was always full of water and drinks, all request were met with a smile and helpful responses.  Thank you to everyone for making our first trip to Paris extra special.'},\n",

Very helpful. Singh was great. Cleani g staff were nice. Will definitely come back soon We really enjoyed our stay here, what a wonderful hotel and its location is in the 8th district which  is just perfect for touring all the main attractions, which are only a short distance from this hotel. With the metro just around the corner.The hotel staff are so friendly and help full, from reception right through to kitchen staff, waiters, to room service / housekeeping staff. The hotel is very clean and well maintained, with a wonderful selection of foods etc.  We do intend to return again soon Nice hotel located in a perfect location. Rooms were clean and cleaning staff were nice. Singh at the breakfast was very helpful. There was also free drinks in the room which is a nice touch. We will definitely come back and stay here Great hotel with great service. Everything was good especially service of pal at the breakfast.nothing to say. Receptionist were kind of cold but helpful. Good location and will come back. Tourist spot near by too Decent budget hotel. Room size is small. Food/breakfast is not good. Although hotel is well located and there 2 supermarkets down the road plus the Rome and Europe metro stations are close by. Kitchen staff and reception are nice. Maybe I would stay again. One of the best hotel when in Paris! The hotel is very clean and in quiet area. Bed is comfortable and shower is big enough. Very good located and neighbourhood is calm.Breakfast was wonderful and thanks to the service by Mr Singh, he was very hospitable and kind towards us 😃 We were greeted by staff at Astoria hotel with exceptional service of Leynawhich is very approachable..I would to thanks the manager stephanie to her advice and hospitality. I would surely recommend anyone to stay there while visiting Paris. All in all - good choice! Good location, close to 2 metro stations, walking distance to Monmarter. small warm lobby, room was very nice (Single is very small but we stayed in Double). The free  mini bar and the afternoos snacks are really cool! In the room - only soap and shower cup.  We recieved the room one hour later which was disapointing. What was more dispointing is the fact they have no option to pat extra for late departure so we had to pay for another full night in order to keep a room for few more hours. Still I think it was a good choice.  Very nice hotel and well located .. Lena and Angelica are nice and very welcoming to all my questions. Except for other girl at the reception which is not so welcoming.. pal at the kitchen is top with all our needs. Will certainly come back and recommend this hotel It was a great stay at astotel. Room was nice and comfy. The staff was super helpful throughout the stay. Breakfast was good and they offered to make something warm keeping in mind our vegetarian choice. Tej was very helpful - also recommended visit to montmartre which we really liked. Staff are all very helpful and I'd like to particularly call out Pal (Tejpal) in the dining room during breakfast who is simply phenomenal. He engages all the guests in conversations and makes you feel absolutely at home. He even helped us to open a suitcase since during all those travels we lost the keys. Besides him, even the staff at the reception are extremely helpful with directions around the place and helped us book our cabs when we were leaving. Overall 2 thumbs up to this property and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I fully recommend this hotel for holiday or business trips.  The 3 of us stayed in a triple room, it was a good size, very clean and having free non-alcoholic drinks in the mini bar was a nice touch!  The hotel is well looked after and colourful, great if you have children. It was Christmas time and the snow themed display in the foyer was brilliant.  Breakfasts were excellent, a good variety and quality. The staff (notably Pal) were very kind and helpful, it made a real difference to our trip. Absolutely amazing! The hospitality is out of this world. The staff is all so friendly. Then thier is Pal, he heads up the dining, and he’s the funniest and most amazing person I’ve met in France thsi far. He also is very caring towards all the guests! Making sure you’ve eaten enough and if the food is good at he’s dining areas. Absolutely Amazing! Thanks PAL Singh. Pal was the embodiment of hospitality, a beacon of warmth in the corridors of the hotel. His dedication to service and innate resourcefulness made him a pillar of assistance for weary travelers and perplexed guests alike. Always clad in a welcoming smile, Pal possessed an uncanny ability to transform any problem into an opportunity to showcase his exceptional problem-solving skills.  His helpful nature was more than a job requirement; it was a part of his essence. Whether it was guiding lost visitors through the labyrinthine streets of the city or arranging last-minute accommodations for unexpected guests, Pal's resourcefulness knew no bounds. His knowledge of the locale was encyclopedic, effortlessly recommending the finest dining spots, hidden gems, and local experiences to The beds were super comfy. The service from Pal was incredible in the restaurant. Rooms were clean. Only down side was the water pressure, could be so much better. Also random thing but why is a bottle opener in the bathroom?? Good location, near to Metro and some nice restaurants near by.  I liked the free minibar for soft drinks and water and the free snacks in the lobby.  The staff were all friendly and welcoming.  A comfortable bed and nice walk in shower.  Our room overlooked a courtyard so there was no noise and we got a good nights sleep. Great location. Clean hotel, staff are very friendly and helpful. Near to metro.  Special shoutout to Pal. Great guy. Super friendly, makes you feel welcomed.  Rooms are a bit small but clean and cozy. Mini bars are included in room cost. Great hotel, very clean, very friendly and helpful staff whether at the counter or in the restaurant (Pal especially). Great location as well, very close to Rome metro station and with bakeries and supermarkets just around the corner. A great 3-star hotel in the city centre. The hotel is located next to a metro and train station. Near by the hotel, you can find many amenities such as restaurants, grocery stores,... The staffs at reception are very nice and helpful, ready to help you. They have mini bar usually refilled with snacks and drinks at lobby. It's really convenient in case you might be hungry you can grab something to eat. Very nice and cleaned room, mini bar in the room is very convenient. When you finished them, they will refill them for you, which are complimentary. Finally, I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to travel with an affordable budget. The location is in the city centre, and the room is comfortable. This hotel is probably an option for you. Pal from Hotel Astoria is vey helpful to us, in helping us feel so much welcomed warmly by the hotel!  He is very open when sharing his experience and knowledges to our all sorts of travel problem. And his advices are always straight to the point and we greatly appreciate his working attitude and humane touch to first visitors to Paris like us. Like to comment on the staff at the breakfast area, Arleen and Pal who are so friendly and nice to talk to. Breakfast is good with nice spread and i must say the eggs are the best i have eaten in any hotel and rooms are decent enough. Location of the place is very close to the metro and supermarkets with one each at the end of each street.   Hotel Astoria ist perfect located - very close to all the important sights and just 2 min walk from a tubestation. We also had a really fun check in expierence with Raphael the receptionist who we had some good laughs with - he also gave us some nice recommendations for the areas - I can highly recommend this hotel because the location is great and the it’s quite cheap for the area  I had looked into ‘busy’ parts of Paris but not the very, very expensive Eiffel Tower / Louvre areas. Found the Moulin Rouge area and read many nearby hotel reviews - I was very pleased to have found Astoria and was 10/10 for value, great staff and top cleanliness, great compact room. Totally safe and would book the hotel again with no hesitation.  Perfectly located and spotlessly clean.  Man called Pal in the restaurant was so helpful and made us very welcome. Perfect hospitality  Comfortable warm and nice clean bedding and towels  Will definitely come back  Excellent breakfast team , good service during the breakfast specially Pal and other 2 colleagues of his from Phillipine. Over all great experience. Coffee was little cold but Pal got us hot coffee. Thanks ! Convenient and safe location with many eateries in the vicinity and nearby Rome n Europe metro stations. Friendly front desk and breakfast table staff esp Pal and Arleen who make us feel welcome and attentive to our needs. Free room mini bar and snacks at lobby till late. It will be perfect if the pillows are thick and fluffy. Perfect location, best value for money, very comfortable rooms, excellent breakfast.   In most of the Parls hotels rooms are around 12-15 m2 whereas where it was 22 and the beds are very comfortable   Very special thanks to dear Pal for his excellent service. Having never been to Paris before we we’re looking for a walking distance to attractions and the Metro. Hotel Astoria’s location is good, close to the Rome train station. Hotel entire staff is very friendly and welcoming, special shoutout to Arleen for taking care of our needs during breakfast and to Tej for being so helpful and for arranging an affordable ride back to the airport, also thank you Edgar and William. I can’t say enough about our wonderful stay at this cozy hotel. Best of all there is a complimentary for the guest where you can quench your thirst and hunger from a long travel. Highly recommended place to stay in Paris, we will be back!  Our stay at Hotel Astoria was an absolute delight, thanks to the exceptional service provided by Pal, arleen and Angelica.  During our stay, Pal, one of the staff members, stood out for his exceptional assistance. He was not only helpful and genuine but went above and beyond to ensure our comfort throughout our stay. Pal's friendly demeanor and willingness to assist us in various ways truly made our visit memorable.  Furthermore, being vegetarian, we were delighted by the exceptional service provided by Arleen at the hotel's restaurant. She took the initiative to understand our dietary preferences and skillfully prepared a delicious plate of upma.   Angelica, the receptionist, deserves special mention for her professionalism and warmth. Her efficiency in handling our check-in The hotel was great. Clean, free  breakfast and snacks and the staff was great. Tej from the breakfast staff was very friendly and helpful. The location was also convenient and very close to the tube station. The location was good! Close to the Rome station. We ate breakfast every morning it’s so nice! All stuffs are kind especially Mr.TEJ is helpful, good greeting he has nice smile! We enjoyed so much ;) Thank you !!    V good location, clean, bright, modern. Friendly and helpful staff. Tes in the dining room most accommodating for a busy breakfast period. And when I managed to accidentally leave a personal item on my table, when I went back later in the day he had saved this for collection. Most appreciated.  The room was very clean and comfortable but very small. Thankfully no bed bugs or any issues. Breakfast was good everyday with a variety of things to eat. We stayed 5 days and Singh was our host for breakfast and he was awesome. He gave us good directions for places we wanted to find. Would totally stay there again.  Solo trip for my cousins wedding. I enjoyed my stay! I probably reserved the smallest room but my goal was to just have a clean and safe place to sleep. Breakfast in the morning provided by the hotel was delicious and the server Tej even showed me how to work the coffee machine. This hotel has a lot of charm. And it’s great to be near everything. Astotel Astoria staff provided excellent customer service- room was clean.  The snack bar area is super good with variety of snacks.  Front desk staff were very accommodating and Courteous.  The overall staff from the breakfast room were awesome.  Special mention to William, Singh , Edgar and Arlene who went above and beyond helping us to contact Uber, Helped with our luggage’s and showed us we’re to go.  We had a very wonderful and unforgettable experience with the entire staff. We will recommend this hotel to our friends and family. we had a memorable stay there at Astotel last june. staff were very friendly (Tej, and also the Filipina staff). there were free snacks in d afternoons, the rooms were adequately sized for our purpose. the location within 8th arr was convenient - it is near the train station and there was a Monop store just around the corner of this quiet street. we were also allowed to store our luggage at d hotel free of charge when we went out of town for 2 days. ao on the overall we had a happy experience in this hotel. Really nice and well located hotel. Good value for money.  Staff really friendly and helpful. Special thanks to Shing who gave us directions and helpful tips for our stay in Paris. The free soft drinks mini-bar is also really convenient because you don't need to be worried if you are thirsty in the middle of the night. We will be back. Stayed for 7 days last October. Tej prepared breakfast everyday and sat down with us to teach and make sure we got to our daily destinations the fastest and cheapest way possible. He is a true gentleman and expert at his trade. Arlene was the sweetest. She looked after our little toddler for a bit when I had to rush to the pharmacist at the corner (hotel is in an excellent location). William, a former national power lifter. repaired some lighting issues we had at the room instantly. It's a plus if you want tips on increasing your back squat and deadlift, he's the man to talk to! It was our first time to travel to Paris as a family and we truly enjoyed our stay at The Astoria. The place is near everything. It was so easy to get to Disney since the station is a few steps away. The Great experience at Astoria! The breakfast is excellent and service was top tier (our waiter Singh was awesome). The rooms are cozy and the hotel is walking distance from montemarte! We loved it and will recommend! I had a wonderful 4 night stay at Hotel Astoria!!   Location: Amazing and so close to the main tourist spots. There is a bus station (number 30) and metro station (Rome - line 2) right next to the hotel. It made it easy to get just about anywhere.   Service: 10 stars! Everyone at the hotel is so nice. From reception to breakfast, everyone is so helpful. Special shout out to the attendant at night - he always went above and beyond.   Rooms: the room was very clean (and cute) with a decent sized bathroom, which isn’t always the case in Europe. The rooms have a free minibar with water, juice and Pepsi!!   Breakfast: Plentiful. I’m a vegetarian and found plenty of options to choose from - cereal, fruit, yogurt, cheese, toast/jam/nutella, backed goods and more.   Overall, I highly We stayed at Astoria for 5 days. Super impressed with the hospitality from Tej Singh and Florence. My dad met with a health emergency and we needed extension of stay. Florence went out of her way to help. Tej is so so engaging and made us feel at home! Loved his warmth. Would recommend everyone to be here. Would myself be here back again. Family Happy!\"},\n",

Staff were helpful and most speak English as well as French. Novotel Les Halles is a fantastic mid-range hotel located just north of the Seine river in Paris.  The truly multi-lingual staff was helpful, friendly, and efficient from the reception desk to the housekeeping team.  My room was spotless when I arrived  with a cool view of the interior courtyard.  The hotel was within an easy walk to many cafes, shops, and marvelous landmarks.  I made the 15-20 minute every day to La Cuisine Paris on the Rue de Rivoli and past the Hotel de Vill, and it was  wonderful.  The breakfast layout every morning was impressive and fresh and the coffee (and to go cups) was plentiful.  I plan on returning to Paris in the next year, and I 100% will stay here again (and again and again!). I stayed a total of 4 nights (through a weekend).  It was very expensive for a standard room (4-stars are not all this expensive), but I felt it was worthwhile.   First, what I appreciate the most was that we arrived early in the morning (due to our early flight), and although check-in was not until the afternoon, our room was ready for us!  This was important because my family was very tired after a long over-night flight where they did not sleep well.  The fact that we were able to rest immediately upon arrival set the experience off to an excellent start at a Novotel Paris Les Halles.  I appreciate how, unlike Sheraton, this hotel does not take advantage of guests in this respect (Sheraton charges extra 30 Euro for early check-in!).  Thankfully, Novotel Les Halles respects Positives: fantastic location, friendly and helpful staff, decent fitness suite, rooms are clean and tidy, shower pretty powerful, and the breakfast is excellent.   Negatives: only real grumble is the rooms. While they are clean and tidy, there were a few little things that weren’t as good as they could have been. When we arrived, the room hadn’t been properly restocked. No mugs or teabags. The curtains didn’t make it properly blackout with too much light coming in at the sides. Most curious were the plug sockets being in slightly odd locations.   Would I stay here again? Yes, definitely. This is a nice hotel in a great location to the metro, restaurants, shops and well known attractions. Check in was really good with our room being available at 11am. Staff speak really good English which helped a lot. Room was tidy and beds comfortable. Some spots were a little dusty but generally really clean.  Breakfast was good, with a good variety of European options. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again. Excellent hotel in a very convenient spot. The metro/ bus/ train station is 1 minute walk from the hotel. The rooms were clean, very nice decorated and very well organized. The staff is very helpful. The only thing I would change a bit is breakfast ( we would like a little more variety). But if we visit Paris again that is the hotel we will choose for sure! A beautiful hotel. The family room we stayed in was large with all the treats, especially the chocolate.  The excellent service from the reception. The breakfasts with a large and delicious variety.  The location of the hotel.The view from the room Excellent location if you are going interstate by train / airplane. Chatelet is literally the center of the train map. As a tourist, i have no problems navigating this station.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Room, staff, reception were all wonderful. I stayed for a week at a suite and was even able to have my checkout late at 5pm. The entire process was just wonderful and stress free. 🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷  The area is full of restaurants, you will be spoilt for choice.  If i had to pick an area of improvement, to make it perfect, please update television to allow mirror casting from phone 🙏🙏  Useful travel info: 1) This hotel has a lift right in front of it. When you are at Chatelet train station, look for EXIT 1 with the lift (if you have luggages). 2) There is a DIY laundry just 5 mins walk from the It was very surprising to find the fantastic breakfast facilities , starting from variety of fresh juice ( real , you re the master to mix the tastes) to salmon and bio foods. The service under management of Fabrice was incredible. I think with such managers even net hotel has its personality! Thank you for such a welcome, Fabrice! Wonderful place, great staff espacially Elena at the reception and Fabrice the concierge! Room was great as the breakfast, we had a great time! Central location and all necessary comfort! Thank you, we\\'ll come again! This is the second time I stay in Les Halles area, and it still my fav area to stay in Paris. We stayed in the Suite that can accomodate 4 people ( 1 queen size bed + 1 double sofa bed). The location is perfect. It is near the bakery that serve probably the best croissant in Paris, it is directly above Paris RER (so it is really easy to commute to Versailles or even Disneyland Paris), near Metro/Bus Station and it is walking distance to points of interest like Louvre or Notredame.  First time in this hotel and it was a great surprise! You couldn\\'t be more central to the city, with plenty of restaurants all around. All the most beautiful places in Paris are within walking distance and for the rest the metro is right in front of the hotel. All the staff was great, they had even made a little decoration in the room for our wedding anniversary! A big thank you to Fabrice for welcoming us at the \"Santa\\'s bar\" and helping us find our way.  We\\'ll be back very soon! Great location! Plenty of shopping and restaurants within walking distance. There is an elevator to Les Halles RER right outside.  Very clean and comfortable rooms. Room service was also quite nice when we were too cold and tired to step out and grab a quick bite. Staff is very welcoming. Would stay here again! Fabulous stay for our family of 3 for a 24 hour whistle-stop visit to Paris.  Hotel is incredibly well located for restaurants, shops, sightseeing and transport. Walking distance to the Louvre, along Rue Saint-Honore or the Seine with so many lovely boulangeries nearby!  Service was excellent and our 8 year old loved the afternoon cakes and treats.  We were visiting for a special birthday and we had balloons and extra treats delivered to the room which were a lovely touch. I rarely leave a review on TA, I think I average about one per year - and I only write them when a place really impresses me. Hence.   My wife and I along with our two kids aged 9 and 6 stayed here the second weekend of December for three nights, Saturday to Monday. The purpose of our visit was twofold, a couple of days sightseeing in beautiful Paris and a day spent visiting Eurodisney.  So - location wise this hotel could not have been more perfectly placed had we done it by hand. The Chatelet - Les Halles metro station is on a short, direct line from CDG Airport, and to our delight, it is also on the direct line out to Disneyland. The cherry on the top is the fact that the hotel is quite literally 15 metres (and no roads needing crossing) from the Metro station entrance Great ambiance, Great Food (Price-quality ratio is alright) and if You’re lucky You’ll be with Théo who is a great waiter. The Restaurant is located inside a hotel, but the garden you‘ll be eating in is without roof and very nice:) we were here for couple of nights, very clean hotel snf very helpful staff. very good location exept that taxis cannot come up to main door so you need to walk a couple of meters to get to street. it was a good experience, breakfast was ok , room was clean. only thing we could fault is that there were crepes fopr breakfast but these were cold and prepafed before hnad to my son\\'s disappointmnmet as he loves warm pancakes . The whole experience at Novotel Les Halles was amazing, with comfortable rooms and a delicious and diverse breakfast buffet. I would like to point out that the hotel staff member Paulo was very attentive and had valuable insights about the local restaurants, especially for portuguese-speaking guests. The bathroom, however, had a shower box that wasn’t fully closed and thus the floor would be completely wet a the end of a shower. Very good hotel, perfect location (there is a metro station right in front of it), outstanding breakfast (really good), the staff is very friendly and helpful (specially Paulo that speaks Portuguese and helped us Brazilians with some great insights about the local restaurants). The   only downsides are some minor refurbishments that need to be done, specially on the breakfast restaurant and on some chairs at the lobby. We’ll be definitely coming back! Novotel Les Halles is very well located, next to Westfield Forum Les Halles - a great mall, near RER and Metro. Its in the middle of Paris, getting around was easy.  DJamel was incredibly helpful!    This very nice hotel provides value for money in terms of location (atop a transport hub), great breakfast, nice and proficient staff. Restaurants galore and a shopping center in the neighborhood.  The latter can get a little shaby late nights though (but nothing too serious). My familly stayed at this hotel for 7 nights and 8 days in France. The condition of the room was clean and good, and every time I traveled, it was well organized.  the most memorable day was the last one. I spent my last trip at the Orsay Museum and found out that I had lost my wallet when I returned to the hotel before going to the airport At that time, Armen, a staff member, contacted the Orsay Museum twice to confirm that there was something left behind. He also explained well to the taxi driver so that he could call a taxi to the airport and stop by Orsay on the way to find my wallet. Thanks to Armen, I liked Paris more and I could trust the novotel hotel more. Thank you very much Armen^^  This hotel is centrally located and an easy walk to many great restaurants. The metro is also located right in the front of it! Now to the hotel itself. Since the moment we arrived the staff here has been exceptional. From the baggage person to the front desk staff, to the room attendants. Everyone was amazing and ensured that our party of 9 had a great time. The lady at the front desk with the beautiful glasses (forgot her name:) accommodated us by placing all rooms on the same floor. Special shout out to Paulo the concierge who was exceptionally pleasant and super helpful in giving us suggestions to restaurants, places to visit and how to get around. He checked in with us at every point we came through the lobby and made sure we had everything we needed. The hotel was very -Great location near the metro  - Walking distance to cafes/restaurants: just at the doorstep  - Walking distance to the Lourve  - Nice rooms - Breakfast is fantastic: try it !  - Best part of the stay was the extremely efficient and cheerful service from the front desk team and baggage crew. Very impressive! They responded patiently to our questions on how to get around the city, booking taxis etc  I  definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a fantastic stay in Paris.   Truly deserving of a 6 star review! Travelled with a large family group with kids and grandparent. Everyone in our group enjoyed it.   The stay  made our Paris trip even more wonderful!  Thank you to the team! The best food ever Pablo recommended us alot of restaurants were very good also lots of place to visit eifel tower also good restaurant and very friendly atmosphere I will come again so as I can recommend every that can come to go. The hotel is lovely and in and excellent location near great restaurants, shopping, and cultural sites. The service was excellent. We were celebrating our anniversary and they decorated the room and had chocolates and juice sent to our room. The front desk is outstanding. They helped my husband package some goodies we were bringing home. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I would stay here again!!! You’ll love it.  Excellent location and great rooms and very clean. Excellent breakfasts and service Located in close proximity to the metro and rer station as well as nearby shopping center Recommended for business trips A huge thank you to the Accor team - specifically Anna and Lorena whom provided me with exceptional client service to make my plans and visit special and seamless. They both exemplify, the true meaning of customer service and combine it with professionalism and a friendly approach. I would highly recommend as they exceeded my expectations, and it is the attention to detail they both provided, even when there was a change in shift pattern, they ensured I was updated to accommodate me. Great work and great team! Thank you again Anna and Lorena. The hotel is modern, very comfortable, and very clean.  No bedbugs!  The staff are very, very helpful, and the front desk staff are completely bilingual.    The location of the hotel, a few blocks from both the Seine and the Louvre, is hip, lively, and offers numerous bistros, shops and the enormous Samaritaine department store.  We arrived at an ungodly early hour after an overnight flight from JFK, and all rooms were still occupied.   We were told they would not be able to clean a room until two hours after noon checkout, so we flopped out on two comfortable chairs in a lounge area.   At 11:00 am one of the desk ladies sought us out (and woke us up) to tell us our room was ready.  Our room has all modern conveniences and is totally satisfactory.  We are quite pleased to have First of all, the location of the hotel is excellent, and central, very clean. From the moment we arrived, the representative at the reception whose name I don\\'t remember (I think Saleh) was very pleasant and friendly, a humorous and smiling person. The room we got was stunning and lavish. We celebrated mine birthday and i got a marriage proposal. The room is decorated twice on different days, it\\'s hard to say which one was more beautiful.  Many thanks to Pablo from guest relations for the investment in the room, and to the nice and smiling Gabriel at the reception.  I\\'m speechless, highly recommended! I really enjoyed the free ice cream 🍦 every afternoon and Anna was always very friendly and helpful. My whole family had a fantastic holiday.  The hotel was in a great position and was comfortable and quiet at night. By Anwyn aged 10 Location is almost perfect for visiting. A lot of places are reachable by foot so you will not have to travel using metro.  Of course this depends also if you like to roam around and discover the city in this more personal way. Even if we stayed only a short period, everything went as it should have. Room and common spaces inside the hotel were extremely clean, services provided and personnel… to superlative. Restaurant (for breakfast and dinner)  is very nice and the food excellent as well.  We were extremely satisfied and for sure, we will return as this was only the preamble of what we want to see in Paris. Great location and welcoming staff. Arrived 4 hours before check in to leave our bags and was told room was ready which was a bonus. Breakfast was ok - great omelette station and nice pastries/cheeses. However jam dispensers constantly empty, pancakes and waffles cold and the breakfast room itself freezing!  Room was good size with nice bathroom. However if hotel is going to allow people to bring dogs they should be kept in a seperate part of the hotel, my stay and sleep were disturbed by the neighbouring yapping/barking dog - not what you want from a relaxing holiday.   The hotel was in great location with tons of restaurants,shops and the metro at the doorstep. The hotel was very clean. All the staff were pleasant and very helpful. Especially Paolo was very kind and helpful with our baggage and recommendations for places to eat. Also the front Desk, Olivier was very kind and helped with means to transit the city via metro. To maximize our sightseeing.  Wonderful stay, came for one night after being at Disney to celebrate my husbands 40th birthday.  We were left a lovely bottle of juice and chocolates made by the chef. The beds and pillows were lovely and room size good for us. Staff are lovely Fporian and very helpful, breakfast was great. Hotel decor is very nice 5* from us. Thanks for a great stay 😁 Excellent location: great transport from train or airport.   In the heart of the action, lots of bars and cafes nearby. Right in the mix.  Rooms were fine, always a warm welcome. Only downer was the breakfast: a bit samey! 2 2 week stays got a bit boring but other than that - great stay. We had a business meeting and every single details was taken care of with the utmost attention to detail.  From the welcome to  when I left, the whole team could not do enough to ensure we all had the most pleasant of stays.  anticipating our needs, I received an email beforehand asking how they could enhance my stay.  A request for feather pillows was no problem and the best were ready in my room when I arrived. The food during the whole event was simply amazing.  From the excellent and abundant breakfast to the most amazing dinners.  The head chef and his team are to be commended.  Their passion when explaining the dishes was contagious and backed up with the food served.   The entire team from reception to food and beverage were examples of true hospitality.  The level of This was a great hotel in a wonderful location. We stayed for 4 nights with our two young girls. The staff was very friendly and almost everyone spoke English. One of the best things was the amazing breakfast. We had planned on trying to get out to cafes in the morning but with the kids it was so much easier to just eat at the hotel since our rate had meals included. Which ended up being fine since the food was so great. Nice location with very short walk to Louvre, metro stop, Rue Montorgueil, children\\'s garden. Our girls loved the free ice cream in the afternoon! The only down side to the room is that the bathroom walls and doors are opaque. So if someone goes to the bathroom in the middle of the night it lights up the whole room.  The hotels position is brilliant. Staff are very helpful and friendly. Customer service is a positive experience. A big shout out for front desk staff Gabriela and Karl (Carlos) who went above and beyond with assistance in booking our opera tickets and giving advise on public transport. Love all the friendly greetings and smiles. Thank you. We came as a family of 4 (2 kids age 7 and 10), and we had 2 connecting rooms.  It was perfect for our family.  It was clean and had everything we needed.  The location was perfect on the metro stop.  We came during a fear of bed bugs, but I did not see any at all.  We would definitely stay here again!'},\n",

Because it is a boutique hotel, they are able to provide fresh bed linens and towels every day.   Our trip to Paris was to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary. We wanted to stay somewhere special, and booked 11 nights at La Maison Favart. We definitely hit the jackpot with this booking. From the moment our car service arrived in front of the hotel, we were met with smiling, friendly faces. Things only got better from there. The lobby is beautiful, and hospitality abounds.  Everything about this place is immaculate and tidy, in addition to being attractive and well decorated. Breakfast is available at an extra charge, and includes a variety of items to suit almost any preference. In the afternoon there is an honor bar available, as well as cake and coffee/tea. We had a fifth-floor room facing the plaza in front of the hotel. I will say the rooms are a bit small by American The hotel was beautiful the rooms were well appointed.  The staff was knowledgeable, friendly and eager to help.  Bring a swim suit because the spa area was fabulous.  It was well located with easy access to the metro.  We will stay here next time we go to Paris. Great experience. Hotel was very clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful with information and tips. Location was convenient for the areas we were interested in. Would highly recommend the hotel be on your short list of options. The Favart House felt like home. The location was perfect for walking, public transportation, banks, and restaurants. Everyone was welcoming and helpful. The room was exceptionally clean, quite with comfortable bedding, nice bathroom and snack amenities. Highly recommended. We stayed at the Maison Favart for three days. First of all, the hotel is close to the Louvre, so it is perfect for a visit there. The rooms and lobby of the hotel are very nicely decorated. The staff were very friendly and catered for all our needs. Would definitely come back next time! This is my 3rd visit to Paris, and it was definitely the best mini break in Paris. The hotel was a lovely find, the staff were so helpful. I had a super comfortable bed, a luxurious bath tub, impeccable & friendly service, tasty breakfast, beautiful interior decor throughout the hotel, with a fabulous location to explore Paris. Thank you to all the staff and owners for welcoming us and making our trip even more enjoyable.  It is a lovely hotel, staff were very accommodating.  The room was small but comfortable.  Sights on the Right Bank and Ile are within reasonable walking distance.  All of which added to the enjoyment of our brief visit to Paris.  I would recommend this hotel most definitely. We stayed for a short break for 3 nights . Fantastic little boutique French hotel with a great location, Louve museum 15 mins, ritz 18 mins and Eiffel Tower 45 mins all by foot plenty of restaurants around the hotel for food also  Every single staff member blew us away with their attention to detail, kindness, and general willingness to help. I don’t write reviews but I was inclined to write one because of how great they were.   The room was great, small, but great! And the terrace left a lot to be desired, but it was a great experience. Couldn’t say anything more about how awesome the staff was.  Amazing hotel!! Excellent location. Very cozy, the employees were very nice with the customers and the rooms were top notch. The views to the Opera were a dream. The blow dryer in the bathroom was excellent and powerful (important). ;) Had the most amazing weekend at La Maison Favart celebrating 60th birthday and 40th wedding anniversary.  I would like to say a huge ‘THANK YOU’ to all of the staff, especially Freddy, who made my husband’s 60th birthday surprise so special.  You made us all feel so welcome in your beautiful hotel and you made it extra special for us and all our family.  The rooms are beautiful, the breakfast fresh and plentiful, and the whole family enjoyed the pool and spa facilities, especially the water massage bed!  We will definitely return, hopefully soon, as the hotel is so central to everywhere we wanted to visit and close to some very good restaurants. Excellent in every respect. Really great location and helpful staff. Room was clean and quiet with a great view of the opera. It was also nice to have the pool and the fitness area and the children made good use of it. This is a truly charming and intimate little hotel located not far from the famous Paris Opera House. The rooms were beautiful and quaint and the hotel had all the amenities you could desire. Freddy the concierge was absolutely fantastic!  He went above & beyond in meeting all of our needs. We cannot say enough good things about him.  Highly recommend this hotel! Carina, you are amazing. Thank you so much for all your help, and your wonderful staff at La Maison Favart. The location was perfect for us and we could not have asked for better service. We look forward to visiting La Maison Favart again!  Best kept secret bang in the 2nd arrondisement. I’d classify this hotel as 5 star by European standards.  ✅ Gorgeous building in a quiet street ✅ Super service. Whenever I asked for anything I got it in under 5 minutes. Staff is lovely.  ✅ Incredibly clean, excellent for peace of mind as we were worried about bedbugs  ✅ Rooms not large but more than adequate, with ample space to hang your stuff, open luggage etc. we were in a standard room, so the others are presumably even nicer  ✅ Excellent breakfast, everything fresh and not mass produced ✅ Complimentary coffee and cake in the afternoon  ✅ Excellent coffee machine, pods cos tangly replenished  ✅ Turndown service ✅ Nice vibe in the lounge, with books, a chess board and an honesty bar  Just to be a pedant & mention a con, the This was a fantastic experience, and fantastic hotel.  Very clean, very organized, and fantastic customer service.  They staff was willing to help at all times and hours of the day.  The spa/pool were a fun break on a night where we had some time to kill.  The fridge was well stocked and the coffee in the room was yummy.  The shower was nice and the bathroom was very clean.  Would stay again. Beautiful boutique hotel in the Bourse part of Paris. Location is excellent and quiet yet just minutes walk from cool bars and restaurants. La Maison Favart is fairly small and very upmarket. The staff wear a smart uniform and could not be more helpful. Beautiful bouquet hotel in the centre of Paris, the staff are very friendly and helpful.  This hotel is extremely clean with lovely decor, I would definitely recommend this hotel when visiting Paris and I will look forward to returning again soon. We enjoyed staying here on our family trip to Paris (two kids, parents & grandma - we had three rooms in total).  The staff was five stars plus - they were all so nice and helpful (front desk, bellman, housekeeping, breakfast staff).  The location is very good, and the hotel is tucked back in a relatively quiet part of it, which was nice.  The beds were comfortable and the pool is lovely - at the time we were there, it could be reserved for 6 people in total at a time.  Cons were that two of our rooms were quite small, the lift could be slow to arrive, and there was some kind of strong perfume in the lobby most days.  Also, the coffee machine at breakfast often didn’t work, and the coffee and eggs were pretty rough (but they did have good crepes, and the breakfast room was very What a chic, lovely and adorable hotel that made us feel at home. Maison Favart is in fantastic location easily walkable to the Opera and Galeries Lafayettte and so many fantastic restaurants close by.  Lastly, the staff was fantastic! Everyone there we met and asked questions/recommendations of was so warm and incredibly helpful.  We will be back for sure!! We absolutely loved our stay!!! We arrived early on the morning of our stay. The concierge took our luggage and offered us a latte. When we arrived back later that evening our luggage was in our room which was wonderful. The breakfast every morning was an additional bonus. The lattes were excellent. The concierge was extremely helpful with booking us taxis as well as tours and providing us with information about the area. They have a wonderful wellness area that has a dipping pool , a sauna, a water-powered massage treatment , and a fitness room. I highly suggest staying at this hotel. The amenities were wonderful and the location was great with several activities within walking distance. After our stay, we now understand how this boutique hotel gets a gold star on TripAdvisor. Great location - peaceful and very central - opposite the Opera House.  Fifteen minutes walk down to the Louvre and many good restaurants close by.  Very comfortable beds and pretty breakfast room.  Front of House staff couldn't be more helpful especially with directions and great restaurants !  Well located, clean, stylish, yet friendly and small.  My room which was facing an atrium had no view but was quiet, which was exactly what I was looking for.  Breakfast could have had some more variety. From the moment we walked into the lobby we felt at home. Friendly and helpful concierge greeted us. Room was small (classic) but very well appointed, clean and comfortable and exactly as we had hoped.  Breakfast was straightforward with decent selection of food options. Very nice coffee. Location was excellent within walking distance of many tourist spots but quieter district. Metro very close by. Cannot fault in any way, perfect 2 night stay, thank you. Friendly, location, bedroom, whole experience was  amazing here…. Would definitely recommend, thank you……..don’t know why revires need minimum 200 words, this hotel is totally lovely…… This boutique hotel is charming and tastefully decorated in an opera theme. My sister and I stayed here for several nights in May on our first trip to Paris. Upon arrival we’d already been upgraded to the Chantilly Suite, which has both a spacious living room and bedroom and was beautifully decorated. We also received complimentary breakfast. Our suite faced the famous Opera Comique and it’s Square. Some nights I would get out of bed to look out of the window and marvel at my blessings of being in such a beautiful place. People visit the square for a while then leave. I’ve never seen more than six to twelve people there at a time.  Most of the time there were less. The hotel is centrally located and very peaceful. There is a major boulevard with a metro station a block or two Nathalie was a most gracious host!  Very accommodating with our luggage storage needs.  And we enjoyed the breakfast she prepared for us, plus the lovely terrace where we ate.  She helped us arrange transportation to the cruise terminal.  Nice location, close to the city center and a very walkable area with many restaurants.   Great location, friendly staff and great  sized room and bathroom.  The hotel was perfectly situated to Galeries Lafayette, Louvre, Touleries Gardens and several metro stops.  We skipped the breakfast because there were many cafes in walking distance for a coffee and croissant.  The one negative was the sauna wasn’t working and, as others commented, the pool was pretty chilly.  We would definitely come back! A lovely hotel in a wonderful part of Paris. Staff at the hotel is top notch. Especially Mariciel at the front desk and the bellman, whose name escapes me. Always happy to help and their English is great, compared to my fractured French. We had a beautiful view of the Garnier Opera House. The hotel is super quiet. I slept like a baby. Walking distance to many brassieres and restaurants. The food was excellent. I loved their Apricot jam on fresh bread in the morning. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.  We loved staying at La Maison Favart! It was a beautiful boutique hotel, conveniently situated close to most attractions. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. They went above and beyond! Our room was spotless, and we had amazing water pressure in the shower! Beautiful hotel! We will stay there again upon our return to Paris. Lovely, pretty little hotel with friendly and helpful staff - a special thank you to Boris the Concierge! Cute little indoor pool that was thoroughly enjoyed given the heat despite it being September. The location was close to Montmarte but still an uphill walk.  We found the area to be acceptable but a bit  touristy.  The hotel itself was friendly with minimal services as is typical of many Parisian hotels.  We would stay again if we elected to stay in that area.  Ubers worked well at this location, taxis were more trouble as some would not take credit cards, as it seemed they wanted to be choosey about which trips they accepted. excellent staff, very helpful and always courteous. Shame that it was necessary to have to pay for more bottled water in the room after the one included within the room cost was used daily. Breakfast and afternoon tea was excellent. Room décor was very very good and tastefully executed. Taxis always available on request within minutes and help with tour queries always handled well. An expensive hotel stay, but a worthwhile experience and great location to help see the sights and sounds and tastes of this beautiful city. La Maison Favart is truly a lovely boutique hotel in a prime Paris neighborhood. The staff was extremely welcoming, kind and helpful. I researched many hotels and am so glad we stayed here. They have lovely breakfast if you choose and cocktails in the after/evening. I highly recommend this hotel. The hotel and staff were amazing.  The hotel everywhere was spotless.  You can tell that every team member cares for each guest their well being, as well as the hotel.  The breakfast setup and attention to detail wonderful. Food was delicious. Just returned from a 4 night stay with my daughter at Maison Favart. The location and room was exceptional. I loved the central location, but nettled on a quiet side street. Our room was well appointed with a plaza view and a place to hang all of our clothing and items for travel. The bed was combatable and the bathroom well appointed. A perfect location and lovely boutique property. This is an attractive boutique hotel. Our room was comfortable, with a view over a quiet square. The staff were excellent , in particular the manager , Carina, who was exceptionally helpful. They helped celebrate my husband’s birthday with kind personal touches. Maison Favart made our stay in Paris a wonderful experience. A fabulous welcome by Samuel.  Great recommendations and restaurant bookings by concierge Freddy.  A really clean & tidy room.  The perfect quiet spot in the centre of Paris making it easy to get to lots of very exciting sites. What a lovely hotel, I definitely recommend staying here. It is perfectly located, half an hours walk to the Sacre Coeur to the north and half an hours walk to the tuileries the river and the louvre to the south.  It is in a lovely quiet location yet only 5 mins walk away from all the hustle and bustle.  The hotel is clean, comfortable and the decor is lovely.  Only a small hotel which was nice and the staff are exceptional, very helpful, they made restaurant reservations for us as the hotel does not have a restaurant for the evenings and booked taxis etc etc, really very helpful.  Breakfast was great with enough choice and variety for most people I would have thought.   Next time we are in Paris we will be staying here again\"},\n",

This was my second time staying at this unique boutique hotel, and I plan to stay again in the future. Situated near the Lourve, it has a great location. While being a smaller hotel it still has the professionalism of a bigger hotel. The bed is comfy, the rooms are chic and the staff is accomodating. The food is good at the Cafe and I love having a balcony to look at the city. Highly recommend Staff were wonderful. So friendly and helpful. Such a warm welcome on arrival--champagne and all amenities explained to us at check-in. Very personalized process. Everything about the hotel was excellent. Loved having breakfast each morning before beginning the day. Location was super convenient. Highly recommend! The service and attentiveness of the hotel is unparalleled!  They have an amazing pillow menu available and an amazing concierge team.  The staff helped me bring in the new year and celebrate an unforgettable birthday!  Highly recommend! Place is extremely quiet given its incredible central location.  Was super convenient to the Metro literally a half block.  Service was excellent and they all took an active effort to make our stay great.  Bed and linens were great.  Room was cozy but had plenty of room to be comfortable.  Cafe Du Blanc was great and the Bistro straight out front door was awesome as well.   We stayed for 5 nights in a 5th floor Junior Suite.  I wish we’d stayed at least a week, enjoying slower days and lazy afternoons, because while I usually yearn for the comforts of home (Glasgow in the winter is ACTUALLY quite lovely!) this hotel felt like the spot I’d  longed for my whole life.  There’s nothing standard about this hotel. For me it excelled in every single department. The comfort of guests is at the fore of what they do best, and not in a robotic tick box regiment like larger chain hotels. This hotel is where luxury, meets comfort, meets service, meets indulgence and they all have a roll about on the high thread count bedding and voilà, the perfect hotel baby is born.  I know that might sound bazar but you’ll get it if you go. If you don’t -  your loss.  This We had a really wonderful stay the Grand Hotel.  The staff was always friendly and they went out of their way to make our experience lovely and memorable.  Our room was spacious and well-appointed.  The hotel was perfectly located for all the sights and easy access to the metro.  I would definitely stay here again. Stunning hotel, great location, great service. Boutique hotel in heart of Paris. Well furnished, attentive staff, 5 star experience. Room wasn\\'t huge but that\\'s to be expected. Would go again in a heartbeat. Highly recommend.  The hotel is in a great location, near the Louvre and walking distance to restaurants.  The staff at this hotel go above and beyond, very professional and with great suggestions/recommendations. Rooms are very clean and the pillows/bedding super comfortable. Will definitely return! The hotel exceeded all my expectations. The hotel upgraded my room, which certainly brightened up my vacation. The breakfast is amazing, the staff is excellent, and the location of the hotel couldn\\'t be better. I will only stay at this hotel This hotel has great service and accommodations. The cleaning staff are quite exceptional. The location speaks for itself. This hotel offers a proper 5-star experience. The food is better than the Giraffe and Gigi and almost every restaurant we visited in recent days.    Wonderful location with convenient access to Metro, Louvre and Notre Dame.  Beautiful boutique hotel with attentive, kind staff.  We traveled during the holidays so we could visit the Christmas markets and visited two (Tuileries Garden and Notre Dame area).  Very different markets, but both were good in their own way.  Recommend visiting at the holidays. I took my mom and two young kids to Paris for a few days in December.  From the moment we arrived we were beyond charmed with the Grand Hotel du Palis Royal.  They offered the kids truffles and the adults champagne.  The rooms were very comfortable.  Fabulous beds, well equipped bathrooms, etc.  The breakfast buffet was also very good.  Location is great with easy walking to all the major attractions.  We plan to be back!  My mom said its the best hotel she has ever been to. :) Best boutique hotel find with the BEST service in Paris. From getting us last minute reservations to the best spots and Radu is in danger of being stolen and brought back to NYC! He was the most helpful assistant manager I’ve met in forever and even makes an incredibly impossible request possible. TY for a fabulous stay and a great trip!!! Hotel is located in a prime location; tucked away on a quiet street but still close to the metro, shops, restaurants, and main attractions. Staff was welcoming and attentive - they made sure that our stay was comfortable. Enjoyed the little touches that made our stay extra special. Room was small but that is common in Paris; it is not an issue for 2 people and if you spend most of your day exploring. The hotel was in a great location.  I literally walked everywhere.  I only took the metro once because I was lost and my phone had died.  The staff was very helpful.  The room was very clean and a good size for Paris.  The bed was very comfy.  The shower had good water pressure and large towels.  I only had wine at the bar, so can’t comment on food.  I did not go to the spa.  Overall would stay again! It was a night to remember. My friend invited me for a birthday surprise. Thank you everyone especially to Nancy. I was Speechless. We also met Carlotta Armand and Elora at the restaurant their service was good, foods and drinks excellent. We’ll be back soon  Most incredible stay. Thank you so much!!! I cannot wait to return and only imagine staying here!! Perfect location, vibe, ambience, and staff was in incredibly helpful. Room was so comfortable and clean, and the spa downstairs was amazing! The hotel is beautiful and clean, and the location is great. What makes the GHPR five star is the staff and service. They remain amazing. The team are unfailingly friendly and responsive. Everyone greeted me by name and it felt like home away from home. The smiles were real; it’s clear they take pride  in, and enjoy what they do. .Alexandre at the Concierge station is a star! Helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon and it was an amazing experience! The staff was friendly, and the concierge was extremely helpful with restaurant recommendations and booking a last minute trip to Versailles for us. Our room was extremely clean and spacious, plus the view from our room was beautiful!  The hotel is in a perfect location, clean, beautiful and safe!! Staff was incredible!  Would go back and stay there again. Thank you for an amazing 20 th anniversary!!! The room was cleaned daily, great view and quiet. Loved everything about this hotel! Thank you!!! We had an amazing time here- would definitely return in the future. Location was excellent and concierge were very helpful in helping us book and recommend restaurants and helped us arrange transfer to the airport last minute.  Room was fabulous, location, perfect and staff could not have been friendlier. Concierge had excellent recommendations, newly remodeled and spacious. Hot water took a little while to reach the shower. Other than that thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and will definitely be back. Excellent service, great accommodations and perfect location! The staff was extraordinarily friendly and helpful. This hotel is a hidden gem. It’s off the beaten path but very accessible to the sights of the city.  It was one of the best hotels ever! Nice food, service, staff at the hotel, upgrades for the rooms, it was simply the best experience ever. And in a quiet neighborhood.  Will certainly return when in Paris.  Thank you! Beautiful hotel with exceptional staff and service in a perfect location. We loved our balcony with views of the Eiffel Tower and the Basilica. The breakfast that was included had an incredible selection of food and the lattes were delicious. I will definitely be back.  Great hotel located in the best part of town just next to the Louvre. Walking distance to the Louvre, Norte Dame, and shops. Very clean and the service was wonderful. Even though we didn’t speak French everyone at the hotel was very nice and helpful. Almost all of the staff spoke English. The spa is small though which can make things awkward if using the spa amenities. Comfortable Bed in a central location.  That\\'s about where the positives end.  The hotel lobby is almost-suffocatingly filled with cologne or perfume, almost where you get that feeling of almost having a resistance to breathing, when you\\'re next to someone wearing too much cologne.  Received a \"complimentary breakfast\" with my stay with Chase Rewards, but wasn\\'t told that it only included the generic buffet until my last day (after i ordered french toast ala cart the day before).  There was construction going on in the room beside me, but the front desk person feigned complete surprise about sounds of construction or where it was coming from, claiming other guests had heard it also.  When i went to my room immediately after, the unfinished room beside me had men working inside Loved the hotel. It was clean, spacious, and wonderful staff. I think our room was cleaned 2 times a day, and the cleaning staff was amazing. We constantly had fresh towels, new water, and a clean room. Beds were so comfortable (pillows too). And the shades were black out, so while on vacation, we slept in! It is close to everything, and we walked everywhere. Wonderful stay.  We stayed at the hotel for a birthday celebration weekend in Paris. My husband and I were both impressed by the relaxed and stylish welcome given by Lila and her colleague (sorry, didn`t capture his name).  Great location, amazing room, friendly staff - 5 stars from us! Look forward to visiting again next year...  This is really a 4star hotel masquerading as a 5 star. What makes a hotel fabulous, and thus a 5star are the details and the attention to the details. While the hotel does offer a high level of comfort and service, it lacks the fine attention and design that warrants a 5star.   The biggest downfall is the design of the room, specifically the bathroom. Our Jr Suite had a terribly designed bathroom. Anytime a designer tries to mix modern with classic, it’s a mess and our room was a great example. Whether its lighting (or lack there of) or in this case an very unfortunate frosted glass door and a dangerous step up to the toilet, they turned what could have been a great space into a awkward and frankly dangerous one. Trying to use the toilet in the middle of the night was Our trip to Paris on this occasion was to celebrate my wife’s 50th Birthday and our 25th wedding anniversary. We had excellent services from all the team who made this trip so memorable so a very big thank you for all you did to make this trip extra special. Fantastic location to explore everything Paris has to offer including the wonderful sites from the Emily in Paris series. We look forward to our next trip.   This was my third stay at this beautiful hotel, we stayed for a week and the welcome service never disappoints and the staff are great , the only thing I was disappointed with is that now their restaurant was subpar, they have a menu which is very limited and seems to cater to only Asian tourists. We thought they’d have the same restaurant as in the past but not to be. We tried it the first night as we arrived on the Eurostar from London. They had some sort of rice bowl, a ramen bowl and a few dim sum plates only about 2. We did not eat there anymore. I hope they will update their menu with a few better options,at least a club sandwich would have been better than that food . Also my husband wanted a vesper martini which in the past the bar person knew how to make one , the gal Great location.  Staff extremely helpful.  Concierge was great. Close to the train and bus. Room was clean and well sized.  Would recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a small personal experience with convenient access to many of the attractions, and near great eating as well. This is our second stay at the Grand Palais - the staff is amazing and the property impeccable.  Clean, friendly, and very very upscale.  The breakfast was great and the location is right in the middle of everything to see in Paris.  We will always stay here when we return to,Paris! The location and the rooms are lovely; however, the staff at Grand Hotel du Palais Royal is exceptional! From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with champagne and personally introduced to each member of the team. Before, during, and after my stay, the staff went above and beyond to accomodate my requests and support me with my trip planning. Every time I visited the lobby, I was personally greeted by those on duty, which made me feel so welcomed.  Wonderful stay in a beautiful hotel in the most beautiful city in the world. Great staff, great location, comfortable rooms, kindness, courtesy and accuracy. This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel and I will not fail to renew my visit. We were only there for 24 hours but everything about the hotel from the staff the moment we arrived, to the food at the restaurant, to the room and the attention to detail, it was exceptional. We wish we had stayed longer..  Excellent amenities and guest service! In particular Christopher and Pierre Jean were super helpful, but everyone we interacted with was great. Fantastic location and proximity to everything, on-site restaurant is wonderful as well. Whenever we are in Paris next we will stay here again. I loved staying at the GH du Palais Royale. The location is perfect with great access to everything we wanted to see & experience. The staff is exceptional… from the initial check in, to assistance from the concierges, and to check out.  The rooms and baths were lovely and updated. And I also so enjoyed the outdoor café seating area for meals, for apėros and people watching. I shall return!'},\n",

Chanced upon Hotel Maison Mère while we were googling for a hotel for our honeymoon. We were so glad that we made the right choice to book Maison Mère!   Paris was so cold these few days and when we first stepped into the hotel, the staff at the front desk gave us the hot towels immediately to warm us up. The check in process was smooth and the staff were so friendly and hospitable. While waiting for the room to be ready, we went to explore the nearby area. The hotel is near to the metro (~5 mins walk), Galeries Lafayette and Opera Garnier. The location is superb!  Before our trip to Paris, we read some reviews regarding the room size is rather small in Maison Mère. However to us, we feel that it is a comfortable size for 2 person. The room also has sufficient space for us to We were absolutely blown away by our first visit to Paris. The hotel was really clean, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the cocktails were amazing. It was my birthday whilst there and the staff decorated our room which was a lovely touch and much appreciated. The hotel is ideally located on a quiet street and within walking distance to all the main attractions or a few minutes walk to a metro station.  I would highly recommend this hotel and thank you to Maison Mère for the most perfect stay, we will definately be returning 🥰 I genuinely couldn\\'t be happier with my stay at Maison Mere. From the moment I walked in, everyone was extremely kind, thoughtful, and attentive. The staff was unbelievably welcoming, gave excellent recommendations, and my stay was extremely comfortable. They had a flower and complimentary tote bag with a hand written note when I first checked in which was a very kind touch.   The hotel is in an excellent, walkable location. The room was clean, quiet, and the shower was amazing.   The best part by far was the AMAZING restaurant where I had the best meal of my entire life. I have a lot of food allergies and the staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. The entire experience was the closest thing to perfection that I\\'ve ever experienced. The chef is brilliant and I don\\'t We had the best stay at Maison Mere!! We stayed for 5 nights and the staff was incredible. We were there celebrating a birthday and they went out of their way to make sure it felt special. The hotel is very walkable and in a great location. I would recommend to anyone visiting Paris! A brilliant hotel in a fantastic location 10 mins walk from Gare du Nord. A lovely warm welcome, small but wonderfully appointed rooms with comfy beds, blackout curtains and a great shower. A perfect base for exploring the city and a lovely little slice of Parisien life. We didn\\'t eat at the hotel as we had other bookings but there were some lovely personal touches in the room. Very cute, cosy hotel. All is pretty new, modern, high quality.   The hotel is very well located near a parking or multiple public transport stations.  We already stayed here for the second time and will be coming back again.  There is a park 1 min away with good playgrounds for all ages. This makes traveling with young kids very easy.  The breakfast is very good. All products are high quality and tasty.  We also dined at the restaurant for new year and had a good tasting menu—a reinterpretation of classical french flavors and ingredients.  We traveled with our 3 year old and had decent amount of space in a superior double room.  The staff is very helpful and friendly.  They didn‘t provide potties, but we bought one and left it there, so one should be around.  If you need to We like to visit Paris every year for a few days to celebrate my birthday in December and like to try a different hotel every time. We like the 9th district as it is quite central and saw this recommended on Tripadvisor, We got out of a taxi on a wet cool day and were immeditately given a warm flannel whuch was welcome. First time this has happened n t a hotel, though airlines used to do it years ago. We were given an even more welcome glass of champagne, then took the lift to our room.  The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was fine , though had a shower but no bath and nice toiletries, The wifi was good, and the TV showed BBC1 and BBC2 unusual in Paris and so we saw some programmes we thought we would have missed. The one omission was a chair. There was a small seat that My wife and I celebrated our 25th anniversary in Paris in December 2023.  It was our first visit to Maison Mere and our 4th trip to Paris.  I found it online looking for places in the 9th.  I did a fair bit of research as we were staying for 8 nights.   Booking online was easy and after a bit of a hiccup, it was all worked out due to their responsiveness online and friendly accommodation.    We arrived early morning, were greeted with a smile and warm greetings, and a glass of champagne!    Our room was on the 4th floor overlooking Rue Mayran.  It was nice that you could open the window - beware of vape and cigarette smoke though!  But I cracked the window often for fresh air and to hear the bustle below.    The room had heart balloons, a nice anniversary message on the mirror My husband and I stayed in October 2023 in a superior balcony room.  Many said the rooms are small, but they are perfect for a couple! The bed was very comfortable and the pillows also amazing.  From the minute we walked in, we were greeted and taken care of immediately! We were offered luggage storage, beverages, and hot towels.   We came early (1300), stored our luggage and walked to Sacre Coeur.  Less than 10 minute walk.  There are so many cafes and places to eat and drink every few feet! Location is A++.  We walked to Pink Mama, Latin quarter, Saint Germain, etc..   The staff at Maison Mere went above and beyond in everything they do! We celebrated our 10 year Anniversary here and they certainly made it very special.  They left us a beautiful note on the mirror and Although the rooms were quite small, the attention to detail and customer service was beyond comparison. Conveniently located to the Metro and lots of dining and shopping options; I’d highly recommend. If you are looking for a lovely stay in Paris, this is it! I stayed here for a week in December 2023 and it was perfect for our trip. The staff are so kind, welcoming, and helpful. They included many personalized touches that made our stay feel extra special. The hotel is beautifully decorated, sparkling clean, and the room was very comfortable (and a decent size for Paris hotel rooms, especially the bathroom! We were pleasantly surprised). They offer wonderful breakfast options, with delicious pastries, fruit, eggs, coffee, etc. The hotel is located on a quiet street near a park, in the 9th arrondisment. The street is quiet, so we had no issues with noise at night, and the neighborhood is lively with shops and restaurants. The neighborhood feels very safe and residential, so if Every staff member we dealt with was so friendly and helpful. Special call out to Sofia for her lovely welcome note when we arrived in the room. Hotel in a great location in 9e only a short walk from Cadet station and lots of good eating. A great base to see Paris This hotel was absolutely amazing and was a highlight of my 2 month trip around Italy and France. It is a boutique hotel and feels very homely and warm, while being very modern and clean. While my room wasn\\'t enormous (I had a single room), it was big enough for everything I needed, the bed was the most incredible bed I\\'ve slept on, and there were a number of lovely personal touches that made you feel very welcome. The staff were all incredible, welcoming, kind and helpful. The location of the hotel was really good in a beautiful neighbourhood - while a little further away from the typical tourist Paris spots, all were within walking distance of this hotel and public transport options also great. Highly recommend.  We stayed in the spring of 2023. The service was great. Nice location, close to the metro, and easy to get anywhere in the city. Lots of nice surprises throughout our stay. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We recommend this hotel, and look forward to staying again! The room is good and staff clean the room everyday. It’s also very quiet so we sleep very well. And the staffs are very nice, when I have any problems, they help us to solve them and they are always willing to help me. We have a really good time in Paris Hi staff of Maison Mere!  I would like to compliment each and every one of you for your warm hospitality. :)  The moment you step into the hotel, you’d be greeted very warmly by the staff. They make you feel at home and at ease! I have no complains about this hotel. Its location is accessible to the shopping areas and the street feels safe. If you’re a shopaholic, this hotel is highly recommended. This is my second time in Paris and I felt that it was one of the best summer spent! Maison Mere is amazing! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay from the beautifully renovated rooms and hotel to the delicious French breakfast. Clementine was fantastic. The balloons and special message in our room was a wonderful surprise! Thank you Maison Mere - we can’t wait to return!!! Cosy hôtel, with an awesome and modern decoration. Kind & helpful personnel. Well situated. Becarful not to be placed in a tiny room! Tiny portions in dinner (delicious though). This is to reach 200 words 😁 I spent what felt like forever deciding on first a neighborhood and then a hotel for our 4 night stay in Paris, and I\\'m so happy with my choice! Maison Mère was beautiful, comfortable, and perfectly located. We loved all of the unique art choices, and the staff was so welcoming and helpful, making recommendations and willing to speak English and tolerate my poor French. We also had an amazing dinner at the restaurant, Nectar, full of surprises, and even a sweet card for our anniversary. The metro was a quick walk away, and there are plenty of yummy bakeries and cafes/bistros near by. Would definitely recommend! Excellent 4* hotel find, great location close to the Metro giving you easy access to the whole of Paris, we walked to most attractions so handy if you prefer to walk, staff are very friendly & helpful catering to every need.  The area itself is great plenty of restaurants, bars & shops close by.  I would highly recommend this hotel for your next trip to Paris, I would def return. Great stay. Very friendly staff to help with recommendations, nice room on a quiet street. Great experience for a reasonable price point. I’ve stayed near Notre Dame in the past a few times but wanted to stay near Montmarte and found the location at Maison mere great for walking around and the nearby metro station to get around the city. I stayed at MM between 28.11 - 01.12. My main concern was my every night rest. I got plenty of uninterrupted sleep at Maison Mere. I stayed before at other hotels in the area and experienced bad night rest, because of metros passing at night, triggering mini-earthquakes in the room, deliveries at 2 a.m. in the morning or drunken young people, chatting at 3 a.m. in the morning about the \"shape of the black hole in hyperspace\". I highly recommend Maison Mere for people whose main priority is a good night rest. Excellent choice. The hotel is located in a central area close to everything, just 5 or 6 blocks from Gare Du Nord and well known galleria La Fayette. Offers a restaurant and a bar. Friendly and helpful staff, everyone spoke English. Room are small but nice and have all you need, something that l enjoyed was the strong water pressure in the shower. Definitely coming back next time l am in Paris.  I have been coming to this hotel’s free access co-working space for the past few months and I am happy with it. The space is comfortable and suitable for productivity and the atmosphere is cosy and relaxed. You can order from the bar and get it directly at your desk. Recommend. Comfortable co-working space. Friendly staff. Coffee and pastries available. Restaurant too and being a hotel I imagine there are room (but why does TA have a stupid 200 minimum character requirement ……………………………………………………………………………….. We stayed at Hotel Maison Mere as the first stop on our Honeymoon trip and have nothing but great things to say! Service was very personalized, welcoming, and everyone was willing to help with whatever we needed. The room itself was cozy, comfortable, and the perfect resting place during our time in the city. We\\'d like to particularly thank Sofia as well for all the advice for restaurants and how to get around. We are on our second honeymoon when we stayed at Maison Mere. All the staff are friendly. Originally we were staying just one night but we decided to extend another night. I will definitely stay in Maison Mere again for my next Paris trip :) A good and unexpected surprise that will definitely bring me back to this hotel on my next visit to Paris. As someone who spends a third of his time in hotels across Europe over the past twenty five years,  I have no doubt that this is an extraordinary place.  No tips on how to be better because this place was extremely AMAZING. The front desk there was completely helpful. A gentleman goes by the name Andre if I’m correct was a great welcoming person even after a long night out. Just returned from our honeymoon in Paris which was made all the more special thanks to Maison Mère.   Room had everything you needed, lots of pillows, fabulous nuxe toiletries and a cute little balcony!   A quick walk to Cadet station makes the whole city accessible!   Big shout out to Sofia in guest relations who sat with us Sunday and was there for us with whatever we needed!  We were absolutely thrilled with our 4 night stay. Our room was beautiful with everything we needed to make our stay very comfortable. The Cadet metro station is only 2 minutes away making all areas of the city easily accessible. The reception team were always extremely friendly and helpful and genuinely interested in ensuring that we enjoyed our time in the city. Had an amazing stay at Maison Mere. The staff are the friendliest team you will find in Paris - the location is near to so many different areas of interest, and it really feels like a home from home. The room was comfortable - real nice touches from all the staff, including a little gift and note on arrival. The cleanliness was superb, the bathroom was amazing. Best bit? The breakfast - which had great choices. Everything was catered for here. I can\\'t wait to go back This was our first trip to Paris as a family. We did  a ton of research online for the best places to stay and we settled on this beautiful hotel. It exceeded our expectations, the staff was remarkable, the location perfect for walking to everything we wanted. The rooms are clean and very well decorated. It was everything that you would want in a vacation spot. Pleasant and helpful staff along with comfortable room. Guest services left nice messages with balloons for special occasion as well.  We enjoyed the breakfast buffet and an alcohol pairing menu for dinner. Great location in 9e close to many restaurants.  I\\'ve stayed in many hotels in Paris over the years, but when I discovered this one I now only stay here.  Their customer service is remarkable.  There\\'s so many nice touches that exceed my expectations.  I even love their strapline \\'Paris is ALWAYS a good idea\\'.  I have great nights sleep here and always look forward to staying.  This hotel was cozy and luxurious. Our room was lovely & clean, replenished with refreshments everyday. Good location and also near buses/metro stations. The staff were super friendly and helpful, I would definitely stay here again and recommend it. (It was also my birthday which they decorated for). We had a fantastic stay! This was our second time in this wonderful hotel where everything has this extra something. From the beds , the food and the friendly people at work. We really enjoyed ourselves!  This a beautiful hotel and the discerning traveller will note the myriad of small details that make the experience so pleasurable and memorable. The staff are skilled, the food is exquisite and the location is perfect. We have had an outstanding experience in this hotel.  Since the very beginning in the reception with a warm welcoming for my wife and I. And specially for our 2 year old boy.  Rooms and overall hotel style being comfortable and modern/relaxed created a pleasant stay.  It was our last destination to a long trip and we couldn’t ask for a better place to finish.  They even took the liberty to prepare a special setup in the room because of my birthday, had treats for our little kid (see picture)  and some perks we didn’t asked for that were a nice surprise.  Always very receptive, with a big smile and lean forward service.  Breakfast was diverse and delicious. And people serving it has been kind and helpful.  Really worth it and will absolutely come back whenever in Paris again. '},\n",

Beautifully located in Montmartre - 7 mins walk to Sacré-Cœur; 3 min walk to Moulin Rouge -  with lovely restaurants and shops nearby. The hotel is beautiful - clean, lovely toiletries, great room facilities and with lovely artwork. Lots of quirkiness too. Best of all were the staff. Everyone of them was so helpful and kind. Just a great stay. Hotel des-artes Montmartre was such a wonderful find in the heart of Montmartre Village.  My family and I had a fabulous, comfortable stay at the hotel, the staff were extremely attentive and made sure we had everything we needed for our 3-night stay.  The location was perfect for travelling to all the main sights and also far enough away from the hostel and bustle to ensure we had a peaceful stay.     We will definitely choose to stay here again when we visit again and have already recommended the hotel to our friends. This is the perfect mid-leve hotel  in the perfect location in Paris. The rooms are comfortable and clean with all amenities. The best part of the hotel is the staff who are amazingly helpful. Nothing is too much and they are all there to make your stay as best as possible. We are returning.  We stayed in Hotel Des Arts for our honeymoon in Paris. It is a beautiful, clean, friendly, welcoming hotel. The staff are really friendly, the rooms are comfortable and beautifully presented, in the evenings you can enjoy a hot drink in the hotel free of charge. We experienced the wine and cheese tasting evening which was great value and really enjoyable and made a memorable experience. Montmartre is a great place to stay with lovely restaurants and bars, very close to the tube station and lovely attractions to see close by. Plus lovely bakeries and pastries to enjoy in the afternoon! A wonderful and perfect stay! Thank you! The hotel is well-located in our favourite area of Paris. It is close to two metro lines, with plenty of restaurants and bars nearby.   The room was comfortable, as were the beds. The bathroom was small but we loved the L’Occitane products and the free gift.   There is a Hammam but we felt that the price was disproportionate to what was on offer. We booked a wine tasting but felt that €49 for three wines and cheeses was too much, so we cancelled.    The hotel was clean and looked after.   We enjoyed the option of drinks in the afternoon with the honesty bar. What’s better than afternoon champagne?  Without a doubt the best part of the hotel for us was the service. Everyone with whom we came into contact was friendly, smiling and helpful. We’d like to mention Alessandra in Everything about this property and Hotel Des Arts family will make you miss France the moment you leave.  We had an amazing time here and everyone that works there is meticulous, friendly and makes sure to go out of their way to make you feel special.  Clean, immaculate rooms and great location just add to the charm of this place.  We loved its location and walked extensively throughout Montmartre and into Paris as well.  Don’t over think it, this place is not only worth the stay but someplace you will revisit every time. This hotel is truly beautiful and we had an amazing stay! Our room was lovely, clean and beautifully furnished, with super comfortable bed and a nice balcony. The location was perfect in the heart of Montmartre, close to restaurants and cafes. The staff were really friendly and accommodating, they recommended places to visit and restaurants that served delicious food. We would like to thank Amel and Christophe for making us feel so welcome and making sure we had a wonderful stay. A wonderful hotel with comfortable cozy rooms. The staff were excellent and sorted a small problem for us immediately. A great location for enjoying the Montmartre area in Paris. Walking distance to the Sacre Coeur. Many wonderful shops, cafes and restaurants in the area. Hotels in central Paris are almost always disappointing for their price point. Hotel des Arts stands out. It is a simple hotel with modest sized rooms but there is attention to detail, impeccable cleanliness and extremely friendly service. I would not even think of staying anywhere else in Paris. Read the 5 star reviews, this is the 5th time we have visited and I can add nothing to the best reviews to convince anyone to stay here. What's the best thing? The staff and their attention to detail. Superb hotel. Customer service was great, guy with beard (sorry cant remember his name) at reception overnight was amazing, allowed us to stay up with a few wines and chatted about the rugby and was generally a great host. The lady the next night was the same. We had  the romantic package with the late checkout that worked well. In a great area in montmartre, 5 mins away from moulin rouge and blanche tube station. It was absolutely AMAZING!! Clean hotel with beautiful rooms in the middle of the enchanting Montmartre. Very clean.  And the staff…. What should I say…. Everyone is chirpy and friendly and happy and welcoming, all of them and Christophe and Alexandra in particular made our special trip to this special city even more special, and I am not kidding. I have never experienced so many funny people working at a hotel.  Highly recommend this charming hotel. The decor and vibe are exactly what you hope for in Paris. The staff are truly exceptionally friendly and helpful. Our room was very nice, had one of the balconies, and the bed was super comfy. The bar area for breakfast (for a fee) and happy hour was so good and we liked getting champagne in the afternoon. The entire hotel sparkled, it was was so clean. We cannot wait to return!  We loved this hotel , so clean and comfortable to return to after a days sightseeing in Paris. The location was perfect too in the beautiful Montmartre area , good cafes , restaurants and bakeries are on your doorstep making for such an enjoyable break - Montmartre is a wonderful area of Paris very authentic and just how we imagined Paris to be. Wonderful hotel in a great location! Staff are very friendly and welcoming. Lots of lovely restaurants close by. Free soft drinks and coffee in the late afternoon and evening and we also got a welcome glass of champagne! Rooms are quite small but very comfortable and clean. Hotel is well  situated for exploring the Montmartre area (in fact, the hotel provides a map of a walking tour of the area to see the sights which we did and thoroughly enjoyed)! There are 2 metro stations close by. I’d highly recommend the hotel and would definitely stay here again. We wanted to celebrate our 30 th Anniversary in Montmartre. I was really fortunate that this boutique hotel could accommodate our dates. We could not have found a more perfect place to stay. The staff, especially Tiffany and Ines , are amazing. They made our stay. We were also upgraded to a room with fantastic views, so kind.  Nothing is too much trouble. They just want everyone to enjoy themselves. The map which they provide allowed us to see places that even after 4 visits to Paris we had not seen before. What a place!! From the friendly, helpful staff to the beautiful, immaculate rooms, we had a fabulous experience at this hotel. the public spaces were charming, with breakfast and happy hour drinks available every day. It is wonderfully located on a quiet street, but in the heart of Montmartre, close to restaurants and entertainment. Highly recommend! I only tend to write reviews when the places I visit are special and this certainly fits that bill. The staff are so accommodating, everything is just as it should be and then a little bit more. Late for breakfast? No problem. Need help? No problem. Warm welcome, yes. And then you find yourself planted in the middle of one of the most fun areas in Paris - bars, restaurants, sights. Absolutely first class. My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights in September, the first hotel of a month long European trip. We both agree that this was the best hotel we stayed at - so many good aspects to mention, from the beautiful decor to the caring and attentive staff, to the evening drinks and the wonderful location in beautiful Montmartre. It is clear the hotel management and staff have given a great deal of thought to the customer experience... highly recommended for a wonderful and memorable stay in Paris. A delightful stay. Lovely room, great position , refreshments provided free of charge, but, above all, the incredible staff, so kind and attentive. Highly recommended . We were made to feel so welcome. Stayed for our honeymoon, got the romantic package. Beautiful hotel, comfortable room. Love the location near Moulin Rouge. Very close to several great restaurants, bakeries/patisseries and chocolate stores.  Everyone says the same thing about this hotel, but it's true. The staff is consistently kind and welcoming. Everyone seems to enjoy their work and passes that enjoyment onto their guests. The hotel is situated less than a block from a variety of charming restaurants and cafes, but the street itself is quiet. So is the hotel. We stayed there 4 nights and only once heard a siren in the distance. Rooms are indeed small, but clean, modern, and equipped with everything you need. If your main aim is to experience Paris and you don't plan to a lot of time in your hotel room, then the Hotel des Arts is a lovely base from which to come and go. Well done! Just back from a weekend at the Rugby World Cup in Paris. So glad we chose Hotel des Arts - from check in to departure we couldn’t fault. Rooms ideal. Attentive and friendly staff keen to help & where necessary inform whenever asked. Couldn’t ask for more and we will definitely be back. The experience was incredible!  I absolutely loved the warm welcome of the front desk and the hotel.  Everyone was so friendly to my husband and I.   We definitely will be back when we're in Paris!  I really wanted to immerse in the culture of the Parisians and it did not disappoint.   Lovely experience.  What a charming and lovely hotel! I spent a lot of time researching hotels in Paris - we wanted good location, good value, clean and cool…. and happy to report this hotel was everything we were looking for. There were many things we loved about the Hotel Des Arts Montmartre…. The staff is warm, friendly and helpful and went above and beyond to provide exceptional service. And although the rooms are small, (normal for a boutique hotel in Paris) they are exceptionally clean, modern and quiet, with everything you could need or want. The beds and pillows were also very comfortable which was so nice considering we were very jet lagged. The hotel breakfast is definitely worth it with a large selection of food and drinks- the croissants were delicious!! Perfect location for stepping Des Arts Montmartre is hands down one of the cleanest, well maintained hotels I have stayed in. Room was beautifully appointed with a romantic seating area with a view of the city, bathrooms have Loccitane toiletries, location is excellent, there's free coffee, tea and soft drinks every evening, and staff is friendly, efficient and kind. I was given a room upgrade upon request for which I am extremely grateful. Thankyou guys, you made my trip! After a 5 week holiday the room was the cleanest of any I had stayed in and the bed was supremely comfortable. I appreciated the little welcome gift of macarons and bottled water. All the staff went over and above with service - Amel was exceptional. Breakfast was impressive. Loved this hotel and I would definitely stay again. I want to express my heartfelt appreciation for the exceptional experience I had at your hotel during our stay in Paris for the Ireland v South Africa World Cup rugby game. The hotel itself was a haven of comfort and luxury.  However what truly set my stay  apart was the dedication and warmth of your staff. From Alexandra at the front desk to the housekeeping staff’s meticulousness, every interaction was a testament to your commitment to excellence. I can confidently say that we will eagerly return and highly recommend the hotel This is our second stay, with the first time being 12 years ago. From the friendly greeting when you arrive, the complete information package including a walking tour, the maid service and excellent fresh roams and beds. Over our five night stay, everyone was so helpful and friendly, it’s evident that they love working there. We had train and restaurant reservations made for us and we believe that we had the best window seat in one of the restaurants because they booked for us. The other item that is important to all English speaking customers is that everyone we met on the staff was very fluent in English and didn’t need to put up with our woeful attempts at the French language.  We will be returning to see the completed Notre-Dame Cathedral ( scheduled for December 2024 ) , Really nice hotels, really nice staff, Really quiet for Montmartre, the room was clean and we really enjoy our stay there ! One and only problem but not related to the hotel was the street accessiblity => we have some difficulties reaching out our Uber  This was our second visit to this excellent hotel in a beautiful part of Montmartre. The staff are outstanding - welcoming and warm upon arrival and nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are extremely clean and well appointed. L'Occitane products are provided in the bathroom and the linens are top quality. The air conditioning is great. The area is stunning with the beautiful Rue des Abbesses, with wonderful bars and restaurants, just seconds away. It's a couple of minutes walk to the nearest metro but with such a variety of restaurants so close to the hotel it is very tempting to eat locally every night. A top notch hotel with outstanding staff. An amazing hotel.  Perfect location yet quiet.  Front desk is super friendly.  Rooms are up to date and clean.  Most importantly for anyone who has travelled in Europe in the summer, the AC works!  And it is strong.  One of a kind for Europe and especially Paris.  The only think we weren't thrilled with was the breakfast.  The eggs were terrible!  But it was a delightful eating area.  We would definitely come back here again.   Cannot fault the Hotel des Arts from the warm welcome we received from Christophe to recommendations to eat locally,room was well equipped with everything you require with L’Occitane  products in the bathroom .We didn’t take breakfast or use the bar facilities but nice to have on offer , we loved the location close to the action of Montmartre and Metro & RER close by , we would definitely return to this charming hotel made even better by a very happy and motivated staff ,well done to you all Fabulous location. Rooms have everything you need. Staff are excellent. An absolute delightful hotel in every way. Near many excellent restaurants and very near metro stations. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Wonderful visit, from first impressions to the hospitable welcome we received. Hotel des Arts meets the needs of all its residents. Located in the heart of Montemarte your spoilt for choice with cafe, restaurants and attractions on its doorstep. Would I return 100% yes, our room was also of great size with balcony room 42 - thank you for making our visit so memorable. If you are looking for the best stay in Montmartre look no further. This boutique hotel has all the charm. When you walk in you're greeted with a wonderful smell in the lobby and amazing staff.  HDAM is situated in the heart on Montmarte, walking distance to everything and I mean everything. The metro is a 5 min or less walk. All the tourist spots as seen on Emily in Paris are local lol. Its picturesque, great photos for a photo album or social media. A local nail shop right next door, restaurants and cafes all around. There is a lot of steep walking but in the end totally worth it. Wear comfy shoes, Christop let us know you could see the entire area in about one hour walking.    My husband and I checked in without any hiccups Christop was the one who checked us in. He spoke Boutique Hotel with heaps of charm. Really enjoyed our stay here. Service was exceptional in all ways. Room was cozy but very Paris. Great location to everything. Enjoyed having gym facilities. Highly recommend.  Thank you so much to Hotel Des Arts for a beautiful stay.All staff very accommodating and friendly.The room was spotless with all facilities and wee extras making the stay that more special .Great location very close to all sights in montmatre x Beautiful hotel in Montmartre.  The staff were so helpful from check in to check out.  Rooms were small but very well equipped.  Hotel is within walking distance of a number of sites. Would recommend and plan to return this Christmas.\"},\n",

Located near Moulin Rouge and Pigalle district. Very good both for couples and families  Beverages and snacks offered A wonderful place to stay near the center of Paris. The hotel is close to 3 metro lines (max. 5 minute walk). Room cleanliness, breakfast, staff - everything at a high level. Snacks (fruit, coffee, pastries) at the reception all day, free soft drinks in the bar in the rooms. The surprise was the silence - the hotel is close to the Moulin Rouge and absolutely quiet at night! The next time you visit Paris, this hotel will be a clear choice! Nice hotel closed to metro station.  Good breakfast, minibar and snack available for free.  I will come again.   Minus: One bed room quite small No bar/restaurant at hotel but snack and minibar available Very helpful staff,good location,cozy rooms, best breakfast ever We were delighted by the soft drinks,coffee corner and afternoon snack bar provided every day free of charge We will certeinly come back I really loved staying at Joke Astotel, great location, lovely and peaceful part of the city,  very caring staff & good breakfasts ❤️  Room was super clean & we always had additional free snacks during the day. Next time in Paris we have a great place to stay 🫂 We had an issue with our door and the amzing workers did everything to help, always had snacks ready for us. Will visit again for sure. The hotel is really clean. The workers are very kind and spoke english very well. Recommended! Spacious room by Parisian standards with a large and comfortable bed. And a shoutout to friendly staff! Also top location, close to 2 metro stations. Nice breakfast en free drinks in the hotel room. I would have no hesitation in staying at this hotel again.  There is some noise from the road outside and our room had a problem with the window which made the noise worse which, for one night, would have  been fine, but not for four nights .  After I spoke to reception we were moved to a much bigger, quieter and nicer room on the 6th floor.    From 2pm until 2am every day there are complimentary soft and hot drinks as well as cakes, pastries etc in not just this hotel but all the hotels in the chain around Paris, you just have to show your hotel passport.  This was great after a day spent walking around Paris to be able to pop in for a 'pit stop' and rest our weary legs along our journey.    The hotel itself is clean, comfortable and quirky.  The staff are very friendly and The hotel is situated really well to get to all the popular attractions, the staff were all very helpful and friendly, the rooms and facilities very clean and well maintained. All in all we would quite happily go back there  Professional friendly staff very clean and comfortable bedroom with great drink selection I felt safe in hotel & the location important for a solo female Have already recommended to family and friends Amazing place. I have tried different hotels in that price range in Paris and it is the best. I really felt that they wanted us to have the best stay possible. You have free snacks when you arrive and the drinks of the mini fridge in your room are free too which shocked me because nothing is free in Paris lol. The man at the reception desk was so nice. I liked the style of the room and the bed was very comfy. Totally recommend this hotel. Stayed for only one night. Great place to stay and good value. Approx 25 min walk from Gard de Nord station. There’s also a metro station close by - Blanche and Pigalle is also a short walk away. Great location for exploring Montmartre and Pigalle.  We arrived a little early but we’re able to leave our bags to go and explore before check in at 3pm. Staff really welcoming and friendly.   There are some free snacks and coffee in reception in the afternoons and in the room some complimentary water and some other drinks.   Room and bathroom was small but did the job. Tea/coffee/ kettle in the room. Only downside is there is no air conditioning in the winter so had to open the window, which can be noisy from the street below.   Decor throughout the hotel was fun. Checkout at 12 which The rooms were very clean, staff was very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is also very good, easy to reach the transportation, metro stations/bus stop. Additionally daily refreshed mini bar with soft drinks is a really good addition during our stay. Overall very pleased.  This is a cute hotel on a very Parisian hood. It's also very central with a a metro around the corner.  Most of the staff is very nice - some nicer than others. The rooms are tiny but they are clean. The decor is fun.   Skip breakfast, it isn't worth it.   The coffee all day at the lobby and the possibility to enter any Astotel to have coffee is a big plus. We haven't used it but it was very nice of them.  Don't pay too much for it, part of the reason we love it so much was that we paid under 110USD - this is the perfect amount for that place in 2023.    Everything was perfect. The staff was really nice we got a free update of our room. Breakfast was with lots of choice and we really like the free food available during the evening. The location was quiet in a peaceful street and near lots of attentions point. Everything with an affordable price. We fully recommend it. From arrival to departure staff were friendly,  helpful and looked after us with great care.  Rooms are quirky and well designed, breakfast is varied, plentiful and regularly topped up. We strongly recommend this hotel situated half way between Monmartre and the Seine with plenty of metro options to get about Paris. They even look after your bags after you check out. For a city like Paris where there are either mediocre places or expensive places to live, this hotel is like an oasis. Small rooms but very cosy and clean. All basic amenities included. It offers a “free snack bar” from 2pm to 2am either croissants, coffee and tea. Breakfast is great with options for salty or sweet choices. 2 minutes away from metro and a bus stop right outside. 2 minutes away from moulin rouge and monmartre. this is a cute hotel. staff is nice and makes you feel welcomed. room is clean bed is comfy, it's central and close to the metrô. you can walk places if you want to!   the cleaning could be better, not that the room was dirty but couple of times they didn't make the bed or vacuumed it ... but nothing major.   we could hear the door slamming of next rooms too but also nothing serious . in the morning Paris traffic is loud so try to get a higher floor.  overall a nice hotel and we will go back!  oh, skip breakfast- not worth it. We booked 4 rooms and most of us stayed for 4 nights during the Rugby Quarter Finals. Very well located close to Blanche and Place de Clichy Metro stations and not too far from Gare du Nord too. The Clichy station was very convenient for getting to Stade de France on a direct Metro line. The Moulin Rouge is 2 minutes walk and Sacre Coeur in Montmartre about 10 minute walk.  The reception staff were very efficient at check-in and throughout the stay. The decor is trendy and quirky throughout the hotel.  Rooms are not a bad size by Paris standards and were very clean. The bathrooms were also extremely clean and not too tiny. Beds were comfortable. The only small complaint is that one of our rooms on the first level was very noisy, even though the windows were closed. I think it Four night stay in this trendy hotel. Room was well presented with free soft drinks in the minibar. Staff were very friendly and knowledgeable and made our stay more enjoyable. Breakfast was also fairly priced but we only had two days where we availed ourselves to it. Free snacks and drinks in the afternoon too which was a nice touch after a days bimble around Paris. I would stay here again. Terrific hotel!!! It is a very nice venue to stay at and very convenient to the Metro. I had a single and it was a lovely room with plenty of space. I really loved the decor all around the room and hotel.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Breakfast is delicious with many choices. I really loved the afternoon open snack table and complementary beverages.  I would definitely stay here again or try an different Asotel property.  Highly recommended!  Great hotel experience - comfortable, in a modern setting, with friendly staff, nice breakfast and snack amenities included. Location also convenient, walking distance to Montmartre and near the metro station. What a find, we had booked this hotel for the Rugby World Cup after seeing the reviews. It did not disappoint, the hotel is spotlessly clean, quirky decor and rooms are fantastic, have everything you need (mini fridge, safe, AC, hairdryer and toiletries).  Breakfast was perfect, lovely little table left out of snacks and drinks should you need them.  Hotel is in a great location on Rue Blanche, beside a metro, good bars and restaurants (1 minute walk to Mouin Rouge) A special mention to Thi Mai on reception who was so helpful to us! We have rebooked to come again this weekend for the Quarter Finals (and hopefully beyond!).    Stayed for 2 nights for the Rugby world cup. Absolutely perfect location, so close to metro and bus lines.  On a little quiet street but also only minutes away from the hustle and bustle of Moulin Rouge area.  Staff all so welcoming and friendly. Cleanliness of high standard. Continental breakfast, plenty of options.  Free softdrinks in cooler in rooms. Snacks, teas, coffees and water all complimentary every afternoon. It was also my birthday the same weekend and they upgraded us to a bigger room.  Highly recommend.   Very nice hotel with stylish rooms. Perfect located to do a city-trip, metro and bus stations in front of the hotel. Very friendly staff. Afternoon snacks and drinks for free, really a good idea. 100% recommendation. Kind and generous staff.  Very welcoming atmosphere. Nice variety of breakfast options. Clean and tidy rooms, buffet area and toilets. Quiet are with lots of different food places. Service to last minute accommodation was well done.  The hotel is located in the perfect location. Super close to city centre and metro station. The service was amazing and the staffs are super friendly. There are complementary snacks and drinks offered to each visitors in designed period. We stayed in several hotels around this area and Hotel Joke is undoubtedly the best with the best value. I would definitely recommend it to everyone, couple, family and business travellers. When we entered the lobby we were a bit set back by the wooden plank interior but were soon comforted by the warm reception and big and clean room we were upgraded to.   Add to this the free snacks, free softdrinks in the fridge, free flow coffee and a simple but tasty breakfast and you understand the 5 start score.  Location is very good near metro and Moulin Rouge, where you can also find KFC, McDonalds, Starbucks and even Five Guys - for those who want to ignore French food for a while. We loved this hotel. Had 2 rooms for our family of four and it worked out great. Rooms are small but what do you expect in Paris. Can’t say a negative thing. Rooms were good, beds very comfortable, cleaning prompt every day. The endless supply of snacks and drinks was wonderful. We are not the biggest buffet breakfast eaters but did it the day we went to Disneyland and it was great. Front desk guy (sorry forget name) was awesome. We really loved the location - just a half block off real busy area. Walk out the door and have a drink at Ray’s. Walk a block and a half to G 20 for water and wine. Would definitely stay here again. Well, there you have it. I finally found MY spot in Paris. The Joke Hotel was absolutely splendid. The price was right and we were delighted by all the small thoughtful amenities. Our room was on the smaller side but it still had plenty of space for us to spread out for our 4 days there. The decor is very light-hearted and heart-warming.  I expected toy cars and a kid-oriented spot but no, despite the name and the whimsy, it was not overly kid-like.  The staff was delightful.  The hotel offers snacks (small cakes, soft drinks, chips) around the clock, nicely laid out in the lobby. Coming back from long walks, we always loved grabbing a Madeleine cake and enjoying it up in our room. The bathroom was spacious and super well-appointed. The location of the hotel is PERFECT. A 15 We stayed at this hotel 4 years ago, had very good memories, so we returned. And it is still a good place to stay at. Good location, friendly staff, good service, including free minibar and free access to an afternoon bar service at other Astotel hotels. My daughters loved the joke videos on the Hotel TV channel. Definitely recommended. We had an excellent stay at Hotel Joke. It was conveniently located near a bus stop and metro station; the room was nice and clean; the black and white decor was fun; and the breakfast was very well-stocked! Most of all, the staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend! This is a fabulous little hotel in Paris. It's in a good location, close to Montmarte and several metro links. Despite the Moulin Rouge being a 2 minute walk, the location feels surprisingly quiet.   The biggest selling point for this hotel though, is its value for money. It was very reasonably priced and has a foyer with unlimited coffee, snacks and soft drinks. This was just brilliant when you get back after a busy day of sightseeing. There is also a fridge in the room that is restocked each day. The breakfast was also very high quality with an excellent selection of fruits and gluten free bread which is always appreciated by my partner. Book now! This is an amazing hotel - one of the best values for your money. Gorgeous sunny large room on a quiet block. Extremely convenient for o buses and trains to major attractions. The hotel had a wonderful breakfast and served free coffee and snacks all day long.  The hotel is modern with a gorgeous decor - comfortable and clean! An incredible experience.  Supportive and knowledgeable staff - can’t wait to come back! Alexis at the front desk was welcoming and helpful. The facility was clean, with lots of free extras . It was raining during our stay and they had umbrellas at the front desk. Service overall was top notch. The hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly. They have a great breakfast and snacks throughout the day. The hotel is about two blocks from the metro. There are several restaurants within walking distance. I would recommend this hotel. When we got there we got upgraded to a privilege room. The room was so nice. Window out to the street. Really good soundproofing but we slept with open windows. Nice and clean room with complimentary soft drinks.  Nice decorating throughout the hotel. Even the cards to the rooms looks nice.   Good breakfast with some changes in between the days. Good snackbar in the afternoons. You could also go to other astotels for snacks during afternoons and evenings.   It was the perfect location to stay in, close to everything including bus and metro stations, but still quiet enough to get a good nights sleep.   Really friendly and helpful staff! Hotel Joke was a great place to stay with even better customer service. Everyone was friendly, welcoming, and helpful! They always had snacks and drinks out for the guests and the rooms were well appointed. We recommend this hotel for anyone traveling to Paris! The room was cleen and the hotel staff always available. The hotel has the perfect location: two steps from the Moulin Rouge, the metro and the bus stop. Also the view is really great. I'll come back for sure another time. We love this hotel! This is our second stay, the last time we were here was about six years ago. The staff is amazing and very helpful. They help you get to where you need to go via tube, Uber, or walking to the various locations. The hotel is so cute and decorated very stylish. You will love the checkered stairs. You have coffee, tea, and snacks available 24/7. Definitely get the breakfast for the additional charge, it is worth it and the hotel serves a variety of foods. We had our teenage daughter with us, so we had to book the additional person. The room was spacious and decorated so cute with the spinning wheel above our double bed. I look forward to coming back to Paris and staying at the Joke Hotel. We also loved the location which is two blocks from the Moulin Rouge, easy\"},\n",

Perfect location to walk to Eiffel Tower 20 mins, use the Batobus to sail to all usual tourist destinations to avoid the heavy Paris traffic, convenient bakery next door for grab and go breakfast and delicious treats, walkable area and mins from seeing Eiffel Tower and the Seine River, had a room with a partial view of E Tower,friendly and helpful front desk staff, had difficulty returning from Roland Garros as no direct public transport to hotel area. Would definitely stay here again.  I booked because it was near the Eiffel Tower, my plan was to drop some stuff off and it be my little hub for the day rather than staying, a bit small but the location and service is AWESOME, 5/5 ! Will definitely stay again!  Excellent location, there are many cafés around. The neighbourhood is very nice. Eiffel Tower is a 15 min walk. The staff is very friendly. There are plenty of shops of different essentials all around  Great location,  good breakfast included, felt safe in the area to walk around. Short walk to Cab Stand Area. Best bakery next door. Front desk was very nice and helpful.  The only concern was, the bathtub shower combo, it was confusing to operate. Yes it close to the Eiffel Tower and central to the Metro but the reception staff & housekeeping let the hotel down majorly. Their attitude is disgusting.  When we checked in there was no warm welcome, no signature asked and no details giving about breakfast. She was very  cold with her answers.   The second day we came back in the evening to discover our room wasn\\'t cleaned. Our room was never cleaned which they blamed us as the DND button was on but there was no directory in the room to give us any understanding on how anything worked. Reception said HSK may not be able to come up because she was finishing at 5pm the housekeeper was rude, and barged in the door and did not say a word to us when we asked for fresh towels and the bed to be done. Her attitude was appalling. When Perfect everything - location (short and safe walk to the Tour Eiffel even at night), price, hospitality (front desk was always available and very helpful), accommodations (very comfortable), surrounded by shops of all price ranges. I only wish we had taken advantage of the breakfast in order to give a full review. But plenty of cafes within steps of the hotel. Would definitely stay here again. The location is outstanding. The rooms with the balconies have the most stunning view of Eiffel Tower. The staff are just wonderful and nothing was too much trouble. Hotel amenities are great. Many restaurants and cafes around hotel but plentiful offering within also. Will most definitely return. Thank you  Had a day layover in Paris & based on all the good reviews, my husband & I booked Hotel Passy.   The elevator is tiny but was able to fit us & our luggage. If there are ever a lot of people needing to use the elevator it could pose a problem, but was not an issue during our stay. I do feel for the maid service though since it\\'s probably difficult for them to get to all of the rooms with their cart!  The room was small, which we knew based on the reviews. If you have two check-in bags like we did, it was difficult to fit our open luggage in the room, but we made it work. If you have more than two it may be difficult for you! After arriving we checked for bedbugs & were pleased that there were none. Our room had a balcony which was a nice touch. The bathroom in the room is so This charming hotel in Passy, Paris, offers a delightful and  comfortable stay, with fresh and newly refurbished rooms. Nestled in the centre of Passy with small and specialized shops, boulangeries, cheese shops and market with fresh produce and flowers. Some of the top rooms enjoy a partial view of the Eiffel Tower. Very near Trocadero and tube stations.  As one of two single older American women, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel. WHY ?  few blocks to excellent Passy  metro and Eiffel Tower area, courteous desk folks, pleasant comfortable room, safe area. One negative : $ 18.00 routine breakfast, forget it. Exit hotel, turn left few steps to amazing neighborhood patisserie. True Paris experience with locals, heavenly.   Easy booking. Very nice small hotel, well situated near the Eiffel Tower, clean rooms, good bathroom facilities and breakfast available. Polite and nice staff. I have stayed here several times and recommend. We were there with the family in November. Great location, very polite staff, excellent rooms and beds. Breakfast is limited in choice but still served in a cosy environment. We will definitely come back.  When I arrived at 8am after the red eye flight from Canada, I was given my room immediately which was amazing!  The room was perfect for my stay and exceptionally clean. The only reason I didn’t give 5 green circles was because my fan/AC didn’t work. Thankfully, I faced the courtyard and so I slept with the window open.  Overall it was a great stay! The hotel staff was really nice. Rooms are a little small, but  you get just what is needed. The only thing we did not like was that we couldn’t regulate the temperature of the room ourselves. Location was great and walking distance to major sites( ie. Eiffel Tower, Trocadero) and you have some nice restaurants in the area. We would stay here again. We had a wonderful time at the Passé Eiffel. The room was cozy and quiet. It had a safety deposit box which not all hotels do. Most importantly it had an elevator. The breakfast was nice with a good selection of cereals, breads and meats. The hotel is only five minutes walk from the metro and there was a great restaurant at the end of the block. We will go back. Great location, clean, larger than you would expect in Paris. This was my 2nd time staying here and had a great time every time. Nice balcony, comfortable bed, great service. Excellent location for my work trip and also very close to the metro for sightseeing. Beautiful neighborhood and a really fun stay.  This was our first time in Paris. We booked with this hotel based on the location, price, and reviews. The staff were very friendly and accommodated our early check in. The location was great - only a 10 min walk to the Eiffel Tower and felt very safe. There was a very nice pastry shop/bakery 2 doors down where we grabbed a cappuccino and croissant each morning as we headed out for the day.  Rooms were small compared to in the US but had plenty of space for 2 people. Most importantly it was very clean - we searched thoroughly and never saw any signs of bed bugs. Overall we had a wonderful experience at the Passy Eiffel Hotel! Great location, I found the hotel very classic and fit in as well with the surrounding neighborhood, my room was comfortable, clean and well supplied. The location was excellent, a 15 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower and cruise boat location, we were able to walk thru the charming neighborhoods to the Arc de Triomphe, Catacombs of Paris, Louvre Museum and Notre Dame. There were many restaurant\\'s minutes from the Hotel.  Great hotel in Paris.  Location very good with short walk to metro.  Restaurants & Patisseries are close by.  Reception staff very friendly & check in was easy.  Room smallish, but standard size for Paris (I\\'ve stayed in smaller).  Comfortable bed.  Room clean.  Good bathroom.  Would stay again.  Another plus is that the hotel has an elevator. A lovely hotel in a central location. Passy is a great neighbourhood with everything you need in easy walking distance. Hotel is charming and well maintained. We had a view of the Eiffel Tower which was an added bonus.  We learned about this hotel from social media and it was exactly as described. Location was a relaxed residential neighborhood with multiple delicious cafes nearby. We knew our standard room would be small, but we LOVED being able to open our windows to view the Eiffel Tower! Front desk staff was friendly and breakfast was absolutely delicious.  If you want to stay in a small, quaint, boutique hotel-this place will fit the bill! Amazing location - walking distance to Trocadero, situated on a pretty yet quiet street with all the shops you may need and a fantastic bakery nearby. Rooms are equipped with all you need for your stay, bed is comfortable. Loved the Fragonard toiletries and the high-quality towels. My room was cleaned daily and the reception staff were very polite and accommodating. Would love to stay here again in the future! The place is very well located and easy to access. The neighbourhood is great and there were quite a few restaurants near by.  We had a really good time and were made to feel very welcome by the extremely friendly staff. The left luggage option has helped us a great deal. This hotel was close to restaurants, shopping, and metro stop. Easy walking to Eiffel Tower and the river. We stayed on a Sunday night. It was quiet and clean. We checked out too early to eat breakfast. Very helpful front desk staff.  Hotel rooms were clean and stocked up wth amenities. Honesty Bar that is in the lobby was affordable and very easy to access. The staff was very accommodating and we Would recommend to anyone traveling to Paris that wants to be right in the heart of the city.  Had a great stay at this hotel for a few nights. Comfortable, clean room with a balcony overlooking the street. Not touristy even though it is really close to the Eiffel Tower. Walk the back streets and you find a variety of great places to eat. Hotel staff was helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay there again. I\\'d never been to Paris before, so booking a hotel for our trip was scary. I looked through many sites online, and chose this based on reviews, cost, and location.   It is in the Passy district, a quieter area. Many evenings we would return to our room, open the window, and listen to the sounds of the city and look at the Eiffel tower (yes, we could see it from our window!)  The room was bigger than I expected for a hotel in Paris. There was room to walk around the bed, and lots of storage next to the bed. The walls are a little thin, but it didn\\'t bother us much as we sleep with a white noise app. The service was great, they spoke English (our French is not very good). The option for breakfast in the morning is nice, and they have some drinks in the lobby available. Someone is The staff were very nice and helpful, the breakfast was very good, the beds were comfortable, the room was clean, cool and quiet, the rooms were a good size, the location was convenient…. All in all, a very pleasant stay! I had an amazing stay in this hotel. the staff is the kindest. Also, they have the perfect location neaby a petit mall, metro stations and the Eiffel tower. The only things that could be improved in my opinion, would have been including a door in the apt bathroom and the lightening in the rows Nice and comfortable boutique hotel within walking distance to Eiffel Tower , Trocadero and restaurants. I requested a room with a view to the tower and it was lovely. Walking distance to shopping too. Very nice and friendly staff. Rooms are small similar to many many hotels in Europe.  Affordable rates too. Very nice and attentive staff ! I would stay here again. The only advantages is that it’s located within walking distance to Eiffel tower (15 minutes) and metro station; bed is comfortable, but room is small and needs renovation; bathroom very small and dirty; there is no view of the Eiffel tower from the window unless you open window and stick your head out to the left then you’ll see the top of the tower; there are homeless sleeping across the street, what a view for £777 euros for 3 nights + £50 per night parking across the street; be aware that janitor can come at any time during the day and open the room without knocking!!! when checked in we had to ask for towels as there was only one for two of us; there is no hot breakfast: yogurt, croissants, some cheese and ham, raw eggs that you can boil yourself and wait until it gets cold Great hotel in best location! Highly recommend to anyone travelling to Paris. Aesthetically beautiful and good sized rooms with all the amenities you need. Hotel staff were very friendly! Awesome bakery and cafes nearby too!  Spent several days here while stopping over in Paris. A lovely hotel that is centrally located and is nearby most/all of the major sites in Paris.  our room was \"cozy\" but it served its purpose. We actually stayed over on two occasions - the first had us in room 4, which offers great access to a small garden/patio area. We then had a room on the 5th floor during our second stay, and it had a great view of the Eiffel tower from a small balcony. The staff were friendly and helpful. No complaints at all. Good location, clean, nice breakfast, v.helpful staff. That is all I have to say but I have to give a review of more than 200 characters so this is just filler. I would recommend the hotel though, if it is in your price range. The hotel is near Eiffel tower and we could see the tower from our hotel balcony. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the breakfast is outstanding. We would like to stay here again when we come back to Paris. Gorgeous hotel in the lovely and quiet area of Passy. 10 mins walk to the Eiffel Tower with views of the tower from the rooms. Great breakfast. Charming courtyard behind reception. Super and friendly staff who were all lovely throughout our stay. We’ll be back The Hotel de Passy is a delightful, older hotel that has been updated, well located and ideal for our brief overnight stay. I booked a double room that specifically included breakfast for two however, on review of our check-out statement, after we’d returned home, I discovered that I’d been charge for two breakfasts, over and above the breakfasts included hotel rate. I immediately sent the hotel an email bringing this error to their attention, requesting a refund of the amount overcharged, approximately 32 USD. I sent a follow up email five days later and have not received the courtesy of a reply. I highly recommend anyone staying at this hotel carefully review your statement and ask for clarification if you do not understand French and the current exchange rate. We traveled to Paris in early July 2023.  We had two rooms at this hotel (a triple and a double room.) We found Passy Eiffel Hotel on Tripadvisor and booked it based on the good reviews.  We were misled!   The Double room was very small and it was dirty when we arrived.  The bedding had brown spots and smudges all over it.  The floor had not been vacuumed.  The bathroom was barely passable.  We debated just leaving the hotel and losing our money it was that bad.  We decided to call the front desk and ask for new bedding to be put on the bed and to make-do with the dirty floor and bathroom.  The front desk actually called us back and rudely said the housekeeper said the room was fine.  We had to go in there and show the rude housekeeper all of the obvious dirt.  She did change'},\n",

The staff was very welcoming, and small touches such as a gift and chocolates were greatly appreciated. The room was very clean, and everything was included in the room. Breakfast buffet was great with lot of options. The fact to have some cakes and lollies offered in the lobby is also a considerate touch to the client. Will definitely come back. We had a great stay at the Best Western La Demeure. The room was very clean and spacious. They have a 24h reception which was very pleasant and the people were really nice and friendly. Whilst our stay they was some construction work on the hotel but we didn’t notice anything at all. We had a great stay  The hotel is so lovely, We stayed in room number 103, which was spacious and comfy for the short break in Paris. The location is great too, in Saint-Marcel, one minute walk to the station, and the area is nice too.   I would love to thank Seifeldine the night manager at the hotel, he did his best since we checked in as we arrived a bit late, and he was super helpful and super friendly.   He also extended our sauna booking time and offered many complimentary fruits and cookies, he facilitated our stay and made it lovely and I would book again at the same hotel   I couldn't be happier with my choice of a place to stay. The location is excellent. The hotel is clean and quiet and the staff is friendly, competent and helpful. The room was well appointed and surprisingly large, particularly by the standards of Paris hotels.  Everybody was very helpful and the room was nice but much smaller than we had expected. The breakfast was a bit to expensive, if we would have booked on your website insted from booking.com it would have been inclouded  The hotel on first arrival was covered in scaffolding and the works started early morning with banging outside the window. The hotel itself is quite dated in corridors, carpets looked dirty. Our room was not cleaned the two days we were there.  Rooms are INSANELY small even for paris standards. If you are staying for more than two nights, there will not be enough space for your things- no wardrobe, only a few hangers on the wall. No bar in the hotel and the wine is very poor (you can get bottles from reception). Although advertised near Latin qtr, it is a far walk at least 20 mins to st Germain. The only thing that made this ok was the staff are lovely, especially Caroline.  We stay in Paris frequently and would not recommend this hotel unfortunately. it was a great location for transport links, two metro stations very near by.  the staff were always very helpful and accommodating.  superior double room, very comfortable and spacious, lovely shower.  we loved the complementary sauna option in the fitness area.  the breakfast offered great selection, we would stay here again.  A really nice hotel in a quiet area. We spent 4 nights there and all good! Plenty of restaurants in the area to choose between and if you want go to city center it is a 30 min walk. We had breakfast at nearby bakeries so we didn't try the breakfast at the hotel. There is also a small gym that we didn't try. Very good service in the reception!  Perfect stay, great location. Very quiet and cozy hotel. Great hospitality and very friendly staff. I will come back for sure. Got there early in the morning and left my stuff for the rest of the day.  Nice, clean hotel, good breakfast (not lavish, but everything there, not always so in France), friendly service & staff, shower water pressure good for an older building :-) Not far from subway stations. We were lucky to find this great hotel for our last night in Paris. The hotel has a boutique feel and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The location is great (central but not too touristy), breakfast was very good and the room was well appointed.  We will definitely stay here again on our next trip back to Paris.  This little boutique hotel offers everything the big hotels and more, a more intimate experience with little touches which make the stay extra special. A fantastic place overall. Situated well near some of best parks in Paris and a stones throw away from all the Paris icons. I really enjoyed my experience here! The hotel is in the latin quarter so super accessible to bakeries/grocery stores/metro/etc. it is about a 15-20 walk to RER B which takes you directly from airport.  The staff was amazing! Super accommodating and helpful. Breakfast spread was quite extensive and delicious. Would definitely stay again! We were nervous about our stay in Paris. What district to stay in and all the talk about the small rooms. After hours on the computer and reading hundreds of reviews I settled on the La Demeure. What a fantastic choice. Our room was on the 6th floor and they have an elevator that is adequate in size for about 4 people. The room was good size and a fantastic bed that was about the size of a queen. Nice because I'm a big guy. The staff were super helpful with everything. The Metro was just a short stop away and after using for a week seemed found it to be perfect for getting to every popular stop in Paris. Including Versailles. This is in district 5 the Latin district. It is a fun SAFE district with so many great places to eat. The hotel has a bakery across the street and a This is a lovely hotel with the most helpful staff. The lady at the front desk was amazing. The beds are so comfortable and rooms are so clean. Beautiful decor and a great space. Going to stay her again when i return. The hotel is located in a nice area within walking distance to a lot of lovely places like Pantheon, Quartier Latin, the Botanic Garden and even Canal S:t Martin and Marais. The room was quite small but very nice and clean and we had a lovely view over the rooftops of Paris and the Eiffel Tower in the distance. We loved the breakfast that included everything we could ask. Nice and friendly staff. We had a very enjoyable stay at La Demeure. Great welcome by the staff at checkin, with cookies and drinks for my son, who enjoyed them very much. Breakfeast buffet was lovely, with pancakes, viennoiseries, fresh juices, etc.  I lived the service we received during our stay at the hotel. Housekeeping, front desk and breakfast- all of it was perfect service - the staff was very kind and always willing to support with information and whatever we could need. The room was kept very clean! I highly recommend the hotel! Gave us an earlier room since we were tired from our flight (not having slept)  Always ready to answer our questions s  Near the bus terminal easy access to everything  She did her best to make our stay comfortable   To be honest, we were a bit disappointed with our stay. The amenities, the noise from the floor above us and the problem with the ceiling of the bathroom (apparently the ceiling was not properly installed, since each time we opened or closed the door it would create pressure lifting the ceiling and making a lot of noise) are more in line with a 3 star hotel. We booked something else, but it was overbooked. We were welcome at La Demeure and we were treated very nice. Especially our dog and kids.  The room was nice and clean. Beds were very very good and there was no sound of the city in the night. The people were very helpfull The hotel is very nice with airconditioning in the rooms, pretty close to restaurants, and the boat taxi. Would stay again in this hotel. Only half hour taxi ride to the airport, also you must go to the bakery in the morning across the street, it is amazing. Great hotel. Super chic and easy access to Le Gobelins metro. Absolutely spotless. Huge shout out to the cleaning staff. Positives: Huge towels which was fabulous. Lots of sockets and even 2 USB charging points. Amazing air con!!! Desk with mirror. Wonderful shower. Free water each day in the room. Bed super comfy and king size. Lots of lights and lamps and reading lights. Beautifully remade room every day. Lots of quirky storage and shelving. Beautiful decor and styling of room.  Possible negatives but not for us: only one English Channel which was BBC world news (I watched live tennis so didn’t bother me.. but you may want to some downloading before you arrive). Only half a dozen hangers on an open rail, so we lived out of our suitcases which we are fine with as only here for Very nice hotel in a quiet but central Paris location. Close to Metro and really great restaurants. The staff speaks English well and does everything they can to accommodate you.  The breakfast is not to be missed!!! TONS of flavorful local options well beyond the standards. We had the facial which my daughter loved and having a small fitness center and sauna is a plus and rare in Paris hotels.   Definitely will consider this property for future stays in Paris. My Superior room had a small place to hang clothes, 2 twin beds with great bedding. The bathroom was spacious with a heated towel rack, vanity and good water pressure.   My only critique is that the bathroom floor could have been sloped a bit better was after a bit water seeps into other parts of the bathroom - but we Very clean comfortable hotel, staff are lovely, polite and very helpful.  Walking distance to everywhere, some lovely cafes close by. Room was kept lovely and clean,we had a junior suite which was very big for paris,we had plenty of room. Pros: The receptionists were helpful and can understand English. The shower's water pressure was good and refreshing. The bathrooms are renovated. There was filtered water available for drinking and could be replaced by bringing the bottles down to reception. The beds were good. The internet was sufficient. The hotel is located on a street where there are many eateries, bakeries and banks, and a short walk from a Carrefour supermarket, and not far from the Metro stations. Cons: There is only one elevator, and at one point, it was out of order.  It was difficult to sleep at night as there were loud sirens, trucks or motorcycles rumbling through the night, as well as people talking outside.  Notes: 1) If booking directly with the hotel (this particular hotel, not the Best Western really nice last minute room for an unexpected layover in Paris - staff, location ,room, breakfast, self serve bar area all we're great! why is there a minimum of 200 characters ? smile face emoji - I'm usually pretty brief.... This hotel was perfect for our family of four. The staff was very nice and accommodating. The breakfast was complete and the location was great (outside of the busiest part of Paris but with a metro station two blocks away.  What a pleasant surprise this hotel was! By Paris standards, our room was quite spacious, had a lovely view of the Eiffel Tower, and was very clean and modern (also had one of the best showers I’ve ever used!). The area was quiet, convenient, and charming to explore in its own right. The included breakfast was also surprisingly good and was served until 10:30am every day, for which we were exceedingly grateful after some late nights out! I really felt like we got a lot of value for our money, which I didn’t expect when planning a last minute trip to Paris at the height of tourist season. Will definitely stay there again! Staff was friendly and helpful. They gave us some great suggestions. The shower leaked and water was on the floor outside after taking a shower but the shower control was amazing. FIrst time I have seen such a device. The room was small. This hotel has an ideal location with regard to many aspects. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the room was clean and very pleasantly designed. Taking into account the enormous price of almost € 300 per night, however, I feel that the room could have been a little more spacious or could at least have provided some more space to stow suitcases and to store or hang up clothes.  Lovely hotel just a short walk from Gare Austerlitz and or the metro station.  We received a very warm welcome on arrival and by luck our room was ready.  The room was quite large by Paris standards and very clean.  We had the breakfast which was good value and plentiful and good quality too.  There is a bus stop right outside the hotel which is in a really nice area.  Really friendly and professional staff. Our stay in Paris couldn't have been better.  The hotel was small (42 rooms) but cozy with everything you needed.  Great testy breakfast to start the day.  Hotel staff (specially Emma) was very helpful advising us for trips and places to visit.  Room was small but this is Paris.  Room was clean and had everything we could need.  Located close to two METRO stations and bus services across the street  We will book this hotel in our next visit to Paris..   We were very pleased with this accommodation!  The area was close to the Latin Quarter.  Our room was very clean and we had a small balcony.  It was small but enough space for 2 people.There were many excellent restaurants a short walk away and the tourist areas were reached easily by bus or train.  The bus stop was about a half block and the train station was an easy walk.  We had the option of a continental breakfast or a full English breakfast for an extra amount.  The breakfast was very good.  We would highly recommend this hotel. This hotel is in a great location in Paris and felt safe. It is near to the metro stops, has restaurants near by. The Hotel itself was exceptionally clean, fabulous to come back each day to fresh towels and our beds fully made. Comfortable beds. We were in room 302 and the only downside was, it was quite noisy at night. Lovely friendly hotel staff. We didn't have breakfast, but, there is a cafe with the most delicious fresh pastries right across the road. Recommend this hotel to friends and family  I was very favourably impressed by the modern room fitout, comfortable bedding, standard of cleaning, and closeness to many Metro stops.  The only downsides for me were that there was a lot of noise coming from the stairwell, and that the room was small with poor luggage space etc. Otherwise - lovely. The room was amazing. Very clean, Great views, bed was comfy. We had the best stay here. Room was very quiet so if you are jetlaged and want to sleep in, best place ever! Food was great and the staff was beyond nice! My first time in Paris was  great and partly due to staying at this hotel 10/10 all around! An excellent hotel with top class staff.  Breakfast had hot and cold food and drinks of a high standard and the staff were welcoming and friendly.  This hotel is in a great location to visit Paris with many locations being within walking distance.  Highly recommended. We had a 'mini suite' (2 adults 2 kids) in this nice small hotel. Double room was clean. Separate toilet but shower was in bath tub. Personnel is friendly and always present. Breakfast was very good. I liked the hotel because it was not anonymous. It is well located with many restaurants nearby and good access to the centre. For 30eur day you can park the car in private garage 50m away.\"},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': \"Well located hotel close to Grand Boulevards metro station. Staff v helpful at check-in (pre-check in was done online) and check-out and both only took a few minutes. Our triple room was great, split into 2 rooms, also with 2 bathrooms. Beds were comfortable, with crisp white bed linen and our room on 2nd floor was quiet. Mini bar had some courtesy water and soft drinks. From 2pm courtesy refreshments (tea, coffee, biscuits, soft drinks) are available on ground floor which is nice and Monoprix near by if you need anything else. Very happy with our stay! We loved this hotel for many reasons: the location was excellent and close to a Metro station. the room was clean, spacious and comfortable; and the breakfast buffet was fantastic.  Best of all, the hotel staff was friendly and helpful and we felt like we were staying at someone's (very large) home.    The non-alcoholic drinks bar was open from 2pm, and they stocked our room fridge with orange juice, Pepsi and bottled water daily.   When we return to Paris in the future we will seek out the Astotel chain for our stays. We had a great stay at Hotel 34B from Jan 2-6.  It's in a great location--clean, safe and walkable neighbourhood close to transit and easy to walk or take metro everywhere we needed to go.  Helpful staff, good breakfast with lots of choices, coffee, tea and snacks available daily after 2pm and a few complimentary drinks in the room fridge.  Even in our first floor room right off the dining area, the room was quiet and we didn't hear street noise or other guests.  I highly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to stay here again. This is one of Paris' little gems 💎  Staff very helpful, centrally located close to metro and many bars and restaurants.  Hotel manager Mondhur exceptional!! Great experience...so will keep returning Communication was easy. Location was excellent. Rooms were clean; beds were comfy. And here are the best parts: 1. Free daily snacks from 2pm-2am at the lobby;  2. Rooms had free minibar (Pepsi, OJ, water), & face masks, refilled daily; 3. They lent us umbrellas as it was raining practically everyday of our stay (January 2-5, 2024); and, 3. Rooms were made up; towels changed everyday GRATIS! We really loved staying at this hotel in the lively 9th arrondissement. Very close to the metro and within walking distance of quite some sights. Many restaurants and bars within 100 m.   Small but comfortable rooms, good beds and a great breakfast with a choice for everyone (eggs, sausage, pancakes, mushrooms, fruit, yoghurt, etc.). The only thing we did not appreciate was the coffee. Very, very friendly staff.  NB we had a room on the inner court of the hotel and never heard one sound. Not even from the corridor. Absolutely amazing stay. We appreciated Hotel34B - Astotel's accessibility (both central location as well as accessible for people with mobility impairments), the friendly and welcoming staff, and the delicious breakfast and snacks the hotel provides. The wifi was strong and the room was very quiet, even with the New Year's Eve celebrations in Paris. Would definitely want to stay again! We had a great stay in hotel 34b. The room and bathroom were clean and very comfortable. The location of the hotel is perfect: very close to public transportation, shops, supermarkets and restaurants. The snacks & soft drinks buffet makes you feel very welcome. Nice and helpful staff. We love this hotel!  We had stayed at others in the Astotel group but this was our first time at 34B and it is our favorite. I had made an error in our reservation and had intended to change it.  When we got to the hotel, the manager helped me out and fixed my error and was super helpful and accommodating.  The staff was great--front desk staff, breakfast staff and housekeeping all really wonderful.  The lobby/breakfast area is large, spacious and attractive.  Hotel rooms in Paris tend to be small but our room was laid out well and we had space for our bags, room to hang and store clothes, etc.  The room design was subdued. The bed was large and comfortable--shower was great.  The room (like all rooms I encountered in France during this December trip) was a bit warm for my Excellent location, clean, excellent staff. A place worth to go. Having also an afternoon snack it has been unique. A good breakfast. Going with the family is a place that you will surely enjoy. Another important element has been the free refill of the refrigerator every day We absolutely loved it! The location is great, in a safe neighbourhood, the breakfast is amazing, the staff is friendly and everything is clean and nicely decorated. We definitely reccomend and would stay here again.  Loved this quirky hotel personally recommended by travel blogger traveldrinkdine. This hotel is situated 3mins from metro, 10minutes stroll to galleries Lafayette and Opera Garnia, good walking distance to sacrecur, eiffel tower, louvre, muse' d' Orsay. Just around the corner to numerous boullangeries and cafe's. The beds were comfortable our room was quiet and we slept well. There is a large common lounge that is the breakfast area and it open a gain from 2 - 2 with hot cold soft drinks snacks and a free mini bar. The staff were lovely. A special mention to the cleaning staff who wear hair nets thus none of those long black hairs in our bed linen of bathrooms.  Very comfortable rooms, excellent location (metro stop 1 minute walk away), friendly and helpful staff, excellent services (for example free soft drinks from 2pm to 2am), good intercontinental breakfast. As usual the hotel staff and management was at their best , always there to help and to make sure you are enjoying your stay. The hotel is in a very good area , surrounded by restaurants and bars and minutes away from all major sites and shops.  Good experience overall! Food was good and the manager Mondhen was helpful and personable. He made the experience at the hotel good. Staff at front desk was friendly. The breakfast attendants were very kind and observant. I would stay again!  Our 6th time in this hotel. Every time a pleasant stay. Good rooms, sleepy beds and good showers. Best staff. It is very centrally located.  Breakfast has all you wish. Useful for business travelers and for sure also for families.   went with my grandaughter for her 18th birthday , what a great quirky hotel ,bang close to walk to bars resturants ,galleries la fayette opera house area ...would def go back myself , a great breakfast and a free non alcohol drinks and snacks it was fab ..thanks for a great trip ,, Marie and Mollie Nicholson A very good surprise. The hotel is very comfy, design and safe, the breakfast is really good, and the location is perfect in the city center. Many restaurants near to the hotel for the diner. I will come back for sure My husband & I spent four nights at Hotel 34B and found our stay to be very pleasant and comfortable.  Our room was serviced daily and kept very clean.  The bathroom was commodious...with the largest shower we've ever had in a European hotel, and multiple shelves for our toiletries.  The building was built in 1789 and has been updated with all the modern expectations while retaining its lovely charm.  Our room had a safe and small fridge that was stocked daily with some water and juice, included in our room charge. Breakfast always included delicious, well-prepared scrambled eggs, sausage, pancakes, a variety of fresh & dried fruit, cooked vegetables or beans, cheeses, fresh breads, juices, milk, and coffees.  The lobby is a very pleasant space to sit and relax in.  In the Very good location. Very clean hotel. Friendly staff and important : a very good breakfast ! The free mini-bar in the room and use of the free bar in the hotel-lounge is top !  Our next trip to Paris .... Hotel 34B !!! The staff when we checked in were very sweet and welcoming. Rooms are small, but the layout makes it feel spacious. There is a free mini bar in the rooms and free breakfast in the morning. Love the little balcony off the room! Excellent hotel. Very convenient and central. Extremely clean, the beds are comfortable, the room was quiet even though next to the road, and a very good breakfast was provided. The staff were friendly, helpful and attentive. Will certainly visit again soon. Location is ideal for visiting Paris. Did most of our visiting on foot. The staff was both helpful and friendly. The room was very comfortable and the breakfast was excellent. Would definitely recommend.  Lovely hotel, has all the amenities, you have a mini bar with soft drinks in your room refilled every day, a safe and a kettle, we had breakfast buffet with plenty of choice, after 2pm you can get free tea coffee, snacks, big area if you want to eat food or chill.  Staff very nice and let us store our luggage as we arrived early, area has lots of eating places and drinks.  This stay at the hotel offered excellent value for money. Located in the heart of Paris, the establishment enjoys an ideal location, immediately close to bus and metro lines, greatly facilitating the exploration of the city. From our arrival, we were warmly welcomed by friendly and smiling staff, creating a convivial atmosphere. The hotel particularly shines with the cleanliness and comfort of its rooms, offering a haven of peace and tranquility in the city center. The effective soundproofing contributes to this calm and restful ambiance. Throughout our stay, we had the opportunity to meet other guests in the common areas, all seeming just as delighted as we were with their experience. A notable strong point is the generosity of the services offered, including refrigerators and I had a very pleasant and comfortable stay for 3 nights. The room was clean and quiet, the staff were hospitable, the breakfast served downstairs was very good, and the lounge area provides a nice opportunity to chat to other guests. Perfect location near the Metro, shops and restaurants.  The hotel is cheerful and the staff very friendly and helpful. Ideally situated in the heart Paris but the room was quiet and peaceful. The hotel is very clean and comfortable for a three star hotel it is top notch. I stayed in the Hotel 34B for one night, on a business trip and I am very satisfied. The room was comfortable, super clean and nicely decorated, the staff were extremely friendly and courteous. Generous breakfast buffet in a very bright and friendly space. I did not have the time to try the sauna and fitness area but will definitely do this the next time!  Our stay at 34B was thoroughly enjoyable. The room was surprisingly roomy, and the King bed very comfortable. Highly recommend the breakfast, very good quality. The afternoon snacks/drinks hit the spot. Very courteous and friendly staff.   Clean, bright, stylish, welcoming, and very good value! Generous breakfast, open bar afternoons (with reciprocal privileges at other Astotel hotels, all on the right bank), tea/coffee-making tray in room, large, beautifully decorated and comfortable lounge area (we were there on a very rainy day and chose to spend some of it reading inside for a cozy break after a month of too many cities). We had a wonderful three nights in the hotel, which was very clean. Great location. Surrounded by lots of choices for eating and drinking & plenty lovely wee Parisienne shops. Rooms a bit too hot, but got fan! The staff were so super friendly.  Good value. Great location close to main sites/stations/buzzy Montmartre  Cozy atmosphere. Great breakfast/lounge atrium. Really helpful staff. Extensive brekkie + free soft drinks / coffee all afternoon Would happily go back anytime. During my stay there was one employee that was very helpful, professional, warm, friendly, and patience. Her name was Eleonora. Everytime I went to the front desk I was able to ask questions and receive guidance concerning the surrounding area. Every morning breakfast was offered with a variety of choices, hot and cold meals provided.  Hotel lobby  was colorful with an unique decor.  My only complaint was with the housekeeper on two separate occasions did not put enough toilet paper in the room. I had to go to the front desk and request for toilet paper.  ................. Lovely hotel in a superb location. Superior room was great , lots of room, small balcony, huge comfortable bed, large bathroom & shower…loved the bright & modern decor. Staff were brilliant & I loved the 24 hour coffee & snacks available in the lobby.No problem in recommending this modern stylish hotel . I stayed for 2 nights in October 2023 at the hotel, I highly recommend the hotel, it is located in a central location by metro and bus lines, the room is clean, includes a toilet and a shower, with all the necessary equipment, including a refrigerator with free drinking bottles, a full and varied breakfast 12 euros or 8 euros For those who check in online and mark a meal, from 14:00 free coffee and cakes until 02:00, the staff is kind and welcoming Hotel 34B had everything I needed for a fantastic stay in Paris. Friendly efficient staff, delicious pancakes at breakfast, a free soft drink minibar in the room and I had a bath and a balcony in mine which really made a difference to my stay. The common areas are fun (and currently decorated for Halloween!) the room is super clean and organised and the location means so much of the city is easily walkable. The weekday nights were quiet but the weekend nights were a little louder from the surrounding area - not a complaint, just something to note if you’re a light sleeper. I highly recommend staying at Hotel 34B and will definitely be back. Perfect as expected  Room/service/ place, in the center of paris.  I would totally recomend and come back . Its very hard in paris to find place good for this price. Just don’t hesitate to make a reservation !!! A wonderful hotel Very very cozy, convenient, welcoming, clean - in a perfect location and very ckose to Metro grands boulevards. Excellent breakfast Sometimes a little noise from the street We will come back \\U0001fa77 Cozy boutique hotel that was comfortable and quiet in a good location and did not break the bank. Loved the free afternoon beverages and snacks plus mini-bar offerings. Staff is friendly and responsive and the hotel itself is cute/unique looking.  Beds were quite comfy and we had small balcony overlooking the city which was unexpected! The rooms are uniquely decorated and not the stale, cookie cutter hotel rooms we usually stay in.  For American travelers like myself there are a few things to keep in mind.  This is a French boutique hotel so you do not get a giant room with a big closet and lots of bathroom amenities.  We did struggle a bit with storing our belongings as the room was small even though we booked a larger room.  There is no closet or chest of drawers. There's just Lovely hotel, staff friendly from reception to wait staff. Very courteous. They didn’t fuss or bother you and gave great recommendations on where to eat and places to visit. Wonderful place to stay we totally would go back and stay there again. Highly recommend.  Mrs& Mrs Morris \"},\n",

The manager and every single staff here were incredibly friendly, professional and accommodating. I felt right at home. The breakfast was wonderful, and room was super clean, stylish and well set up. The location is fantastic and right around the corner from a train station. I loved that it’s not in the super touristy area, but very conveniently located. I look forward to coming back when I’m in Paris again. Thanks to everyone for a wonderful stay! My husband and I had a good time while staying at the hotel. The receptionists are so nice and friendly.  The room is so comfortable and cozy.  We enjoyed the breakfast in the restaurant every morning with beautiful Eiffel Tower view. Love the hotel, the views everyone very sweet and great helpful.. help us with everything. We a couple first time in paris and have wonderful exper! We will come back and recommend everyone stay here  Mostly everything was good. Please note that the view shown on the pictures is a premium room that you must request way way in advance. some of the front desk folks could've been more friendly. Breakfast was great.  My boyfriend and I were staying outside of Paris for his business trip in August 2022 and booked a last minute overnight stay in the city. The staff was friendly and upgraded our room to a center view of the Eiffel Tower when our original view was from the side. I booked this hotel for the view so I was very excited to get a better view. I felt very safe here since all the doors and elevator required a room key to work. The room was a great size for Paris and the bathroom was large as well. It has modern upgrades while still having the Parisian charm. The A/C worked great and the bed was comfortable. The location of this hotel is also amazing and the metro isn’t needed to get to a lot of great places. We would definitely book here again!  Wonderful / helpful staff.  Convenient location / bright, clean, & well maintained hotel. Paris had a bed bug infestation at the time we were there but our room having white walls, all white bathroom, & white bed sheets made it easy to determine if there were bugs (of any kind) anywhere in our room.  Absolutely, no bug problem there... It was a great experience. Very professional staff, very kind also. The room was clean, spacious, well equipped and most of all, quiet. I admit that we were afraid it would be noisy because of the location but it was not all. The windows were very high quality, and the room was well insulated.  The bathroom was new and clean. The view was fantastic. The breakfast was really good as well with a lot of different choices.  Highly recommended and we will go back.  First off, anyone who doesn’t give this establishment a 5 star has missed the mark!!!! This hotel was fabulous!!! The view of the Eiffel tower far surpasses any more pricey hotels. The staff was wonderful and the breakfast was superb!! This was a very special occasion and we came to our room all decorated and champagne!!!!! We requested a balcony room and we got it!! We highly highly recommend the Hotel La Comtesse, you will love it!!!! Beautiful stay and a nice view of the Eiffel Tower from the balcony! Would definitely stay again! They were accommodating and nice. The beds and linens were very soft and comfortable and they kept the hotel very clean!  The location is great and very accessible and a great cafe attached!  Comfortable room with enough closet space for myself and my husband. Nice bathroom and excellent side view of the eiffel tower.  Very welcoming and helpful staff. Can't beat the location for all your city adventures. The best view I’ve ever had! Amazing staff and beautiful hotel, they upgraded our room for free because of my girlfriend’s birthday. Whenever I come back to Paris I will for sure choose this hotel. 10 /10 Amazing location with a very good view of the Eiffel Tower. Excellent and helpful staff  who made our stay even more comfortable. We would totally recommend Hotel La Comtesse and definitely choose it again.   Balcony room had a wonderful view as advertised. Breakfast served downstairs had a nice selection and very helpful staff. Of note, Emilie at the front desk facilitated my check in and out process beautifully and she is truly such a great asset to the hotel. Thank you Emilie for also opening my wine bottle! The best part of our stay at this hotel is the location. Seeing the Eiffel out our window daily, day and night, added to our Parisian memories. Staff was very friendly, and the daily breakfast was good. Only suggestion - please put a sign by the automatic coffee machine in the restaurant in the afternoon. We thought guests could get a cup, but were told by a staff that he needed to serve us, and bill to our room. That could have been handled better. Otherwise all was good. Staff was excellent!!! So helpful! Beds were comfy! View was excellent. Location was good if you want to be close to the Eiffel Tower and a metro station. Only con: A little noisy in the rooms as you could hear people closing their doors all night.  Great hotel and caring staff, and they are always ready to provide anything needed. Great location for visiting the Eiffel Tower, Louvre museum, royal palaces, and great restaurants.  Rooms are Very well appointed, with very comfortable beds/bedding. Good selection of breakfast items, from hot to cold. Great place to stay! Fab value hotel - great location, great service and the room was lovely! Spotless, Modern and a big comfy bed, what more can you ask for? Lovely bathroom too and a powerful, hot, shower   Lots of restaurants nearby and right across the road from the metro. In comparison to many of the surrounding hotels, in terms of value for money, this one wins hands down!  Magnificent stay. View was unforgettable,  especially for first night ever in Paris. Complimentary champagne for our anniversary was such a nice touch. Everything about this hotel was perfect. I highly recommend.    It was a good stay, the hotel is in a great location, a beautiful place full of good vibes. Going out on a bike there is simple, with good bike trails on many routes.  The rooms are small but very comfortable and above all very clean frankly we have nothing bad to say about this hotel. we loved every moment spent in this hotel the receptionists were very friendly with us always present to help. Our vacation overall was the best vacation we've have ever had. That being said, Hotel La Comtesse had a lot to do with it. The morning breakfast in the cafe was an absolute delight. We looked forward to it everyday. The room was beautiful, the balcony view of the Eiffel Tower literally took our breath away but the BED. The bed the comforter the pillows....it was like sleeping on clouds. Thank you Hotel La Comtesse and staff for a WONDERFUL unforgettable vacation. I can't wait to see you again! Quaint hotel with great location right by Eiffel Tower. Lots of action nearby and easy access to metro station to go to other areas of Paris. Staff was friendly and helpful.   Highly recommend if you’re staying in Paris Booked this hotel for a quick stay in Paris on our way to Normandy.  The breakfast is worth the money, the room was clean and comfortable and the view of the Eiffel Tour was exactly as described.  The local eating options are plentiful and the location is perfect for days of sight-seeing.  This hotel did not disappoint and I would suggest to anyone.  My favorite place to stay is Paris. The rooms are beautiful and clean with amazing views of the Eiffel Tour! The staff is professional and friendly, and always helpful and smiling. The breakfast is incredible and fresh and the coffee is perfect… Thank you again Daniel and your entire staff for another memorable stay at your beautiful hotel! We so enjoyed our stay. The staff was lovely. Our room was perfect facing the Eiffel Tower. One of the best features was its location. Close to everything and yet perfectly out of the way! You can’t go wrong staying here. The staff was wonderful with amazing customer service! The room was very comfortable and we loved the view of the Eiffel Tower! We would highly recommend making this hotel your Paris home away from home.  We had an excellent stay. They also have a wonderful staff. Our room was also ready for early check in which was a bonus. The room with Eiffel Tower view was worth it. We would love to stay here again. Thank you for a great stay.  I did a quick solo to Paris and spend one night at the hotel la comtesse. The view from my room was amazing and I had a such great time. The room  was clean and the staff was really nice. Had a late lunch at the cafe next door was it was really good. Love this place! The hotel was everything I expected and more!  Sitting in front  in the little cafe with the view!!! Amazing!! Your staff was very helpful and supportive. The room, loved it! The view of the Eiffel Tower was amazing.   Beautiful views, incredible way to experience Paris on a first trip! The staff was very kind and accommodating, and really made us feel at home. We would certainly recommend the hotel for visitors looking to be near the Eiffel Tower. Hotel was perfect for our first trip to Paris! Hotel was very clean. Since most hotel rooms in Paris are small, I needed to reserve two rooms for our family of four. One room for my husband and myself and one for our teenage daughters. Because of the need to book two rooms, I had greater budget restrictions than usual. After an exhaustive search I booked the  Hotel La  Comtesse. I was extremely happy with my choice. We ended up getting rooms with balconies that had views of the Eiffel Tower. The view was absolutely amazing!! I couldn’t imagine a better view of the Eiffel Tower. The location and view of the Eiffel Tower is perfect! I was impressed with the extremely clean room and 24/7 front desk help. There are plenty of restaurants close by and the walk to Eiffel Tower is 10 minutes.  I would come back and have already recommended to friends!  We selected a room with a view of the tower and we were not disappointed!  The windows opened and we could lean out and look just to the left and had amazing tower views!  It was also a great location - just a short walk to many tourist attractions.  We traveled as a family of 4 and we were given 2 adjoining rooms for an excellent price.  The rooms were a bit small, but so clean and comfortable.  We were pleasantly surprised by the entire experience.  I highly recommend.  Great and clean hotel l. Great views and within proximity to almost everything. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone else traveling to Paris. We had a great time and everything was super helpful and nice.  Thank you for the most amazing stay at your beautiful hotel. The service from everyone was first class, thank you Daniel (the Directeur) and all of the staff on the front reception desk and all of the staff in the restaurant and the house keeping, you made us feel so welcome, the rooms were perfect and the restaurant was delicious every morning, we had the most wonderful 4 days in Paris and we will definitely come back, and when we do we will be staying at the La Comtesse.  Merci, from Tony, Ruby-rose and Scarlet-rose  I took my dream vacation to Europe this summer and Paris was our first stop. There were many hotels that were further away from the 7th arrondisimment that were more budget conscious but I splurged to have a place where I could see the Eiffel Tower the first thing in the morning when I woke up and the last thing I saw when I laid my head to rest. La Comtesse filled this requirement and more. The taxi was able to pull up directly to the front entrance and there is a ramp that allows easy entry with rolling luggage. The outside facade of the hotel is very charmingly Parisian. Upon our arrival after a long overnight flight, I was pleasantly surprised to find an American english speaker at the reception check in desk to welcome us. I had been a little nervous about my very limited We stayed at Hotel La Comtesse August 3rd to the 7th 2023. The staff were all great. I would recommend the online check-in. If you are celebrating a birthday or anniversary. The hotel offers thoughtful add-ons. I added a box of Macarons and Happy Birthday decorations. Both requested were ready by the time we arrived. If you are staying in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. We would recommend Hotel La Comtesse.  We went to Paris for our25th wedding anniversary. Everything was as well as could be expected. Service was excellent. Friendly and helpful all the time. Room was bright and clean and our room( 306) had a great view of the Eiffel Tower. Unfortunately cafe was only open for breakfast being august is a holiday month for parisions but that was perfect because la comtesses location is central to plenty of dining and small deli type markets. Again the hotel service was so good we ended up taking photos with most of staff there. There’s more I could say how nice our stay was but I think you get the picture.  Our room was beautifully appointed, especially the bathroom.  We had a excellent view of the Bastille Day fireworks at the Eiffel Tower from our balcony on the 4th floor.  Breakfasts were fantastic with lots of delicious choices including fresh squeezed OJ.  The gentleman in the dining room and the one at the front desk were very helpful in recommending restaurants and helping with reservations.  The location was perfect for a walking exploration of Paris and very close to Rue Cler.  Our stay at Hotel La Comtesse was thoroughly enjoyable and we hope to return again soon. We firstly got upgraded to a room with balcony which was lovely. Awesome location for the Eiffel Tower, shopping, cafes and restaurants. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good especially the omelettes. \"},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': \"Great location! Everything you want to visit is within a radius of 2 kilometers, so you can visit everything on foot. The hotel is very tidy, the staff is hospitable. Breakfast is served at the hotel, otherwise in France breakfast is not the best part. My rating for the hotel is 4/5 stars, but because of the BASITH receptionist who is at your service 24/7 and is always smiling and willing to help, my rating is 5/5 for Hotel Cler! This hotel is in a great location - just a five minute walk from the Eiffel Tower and from a metro stop. It is located on Rue Cler, which is filled with many shops and restaurants. We ate there for dinner almost every night of our stay.  Breakfast at this hotel was very good and the breakfast staff worked very hard to make sure it was enjoyable for us. In addition, both Elsa and Basith from the front desk were extremely helpful and courteous.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Paris! Pretty nice place to stay.  Kindly staff anda place near to principal atractions.   Basith attention was pretty kindly at the check in and out. Nice location, My family love the attention and it was near to they Eiffel tower and Louvre, ir i come back yo París i woukd book again in this hotel. Hotel was super small! Elevator fit one bag and one person total! But, location was amazing - steps to Eiffel Tower and amazing little French street with cafes and markets.  Staff were so helpful and nice too! Would definitely reccomend. Wonderful hotel. Very close to the Eiffel Tower. Lots of restaurants and shops. Very clean. Helpful, kind staff. The concierge saw I was very tired and allowed me to get my room early. They stored our bags after checkout so we could explore more before we had to leave. Just an overall lovely hotel. Very good hotel ,  Great location, beautiful surrounding atmosphere, great staff. Most friendly and helpful, receptionist, specially Basith.  It was clean, stylish.Room itself was well equipped and comfortable. Very comfortable place to stay. Rooms are equipped with everything you’ll need. Basith was very nice and helped us a lot. The hotel is in a privileged location and has many restaurants and small shops nearby. I visited with my 12 year old daughter for a 2 night stay. We chose the Hotel Cler because of great reviews on here and also because the location is brilliant. It’s very close to École Militaire Metro (literally a couple of minutes walk away) and all the sights are easily accessible by metro. The Eiffel Tour is 10 mins away on foot. The street the hotel is on (Rue Cler)  is nice with independent shops and restaurants on it. We ate on Rue Cler both nights for convenience as it felt very safe walking on the street at night (cafe du Marche and Little Davoli which were both great for a simple dinner) and we also grabbed a couple of croissants each day from the boulangerie across the road to eat on the way to sightseeing.   The hotel is exactly as it looks in all the pictures which The front desk staff of this hotel are lovely. Basith, Sujit, Mohamed and Pablo were all incredibly warm and  helpful with everything from room requests to trip planning to advice on the right apps to download. The hotel is on one of the most charming streets of the 7th arrondissement with cafes, restaurants, boulangeries, stores, and take way food joints. Rooms and bathrooms are clean and modern, and the beds are comfortable. For Americans used to larger rooms, they will seem small, but they are standard size for Paris. The hotel is well located for public transportation, shopping, and experiencing the lively city life of Paris.  It is an easy walk to the Eiffel Tower. I would skip the hotel breakfast as it is not of very high quality, and the street has a number of nice Our stay here was splendid. The beds were very comfortable. The rooms and bathrooms were clean. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. Centrally located. Looking forward to recommend the hotel and stay there again.  Absolutely wonderful!!                                  The staff was super nice and amazing and very comfortable. The man at the desk, Basith was very kind to my family and helped us out with everything! We hope to come again :) Very nice hotel! Staff is great, very accommodating. Would come back again. It is pretty small- the rooms are smaller than they look online. Eiffel tower room has a great view but the other rooms have nice views of the streets. Great experience and very helpful staff. I highly recommend. I got a pleasure to be assisted with Basith and Elsa. Great breakfast! Spent my Christmas here! It is walkable to the Eiffel Tower and many known locations. I enjoyed my time in Paris. The number one reason I gave this 5Stars was the staff. Very friendly and HELPFUL!  2. Location, location, location. Perfect. 3. Cost/ value 4. Breakfast was just right to start off a long day.  Side note. We travelled with 2 kids in tow. Age 6 and 8. We booked a second adjoining room for them as the rooms are quite small but cozy. That turned out to be a blessing for jet lagged travellers.  We will be staying here again. I almost didn't write this review because it was like our diamond personal find. But it would be unfair to the amazing and courteous staff.  5/5 starsz Had a great stay, location is perfect.  just a few minutes to Eiffel tower. We like the local parisian sorroundings like  cafes. small shops restaurant, fruits and flower stores.  Tiny room , the bed and pillow was comfy, though . Breakfast was great enough for us  Staff are friendly and smiling .   Sujid was kind to openned my luggage on our arrival ( forgot my luggage key )  Pablo was very helpful in ordering our taxi to Moulin Rouge and to the airport.  The small talk with Elsa during breakfast and asking if we got everything we  need and got complementary water when we checked out . Thank you 😊 Thanks to Basith for his kind help too.  We had a great stay here for 3 nights and 4 day. Great value for money .  Excellent hotel with best possible location. Modern and comfortable rooms with beautiful views. Service is above and beyond expectations, staff doing their outmost to make your stay as comfortable as possible. We come back her every year when we go to Paris. Highly recommend! Located in a beautiful neighbourhood.   Room was spacious and clean, metro is 5 minutes walk away.  Staff Basith and Elsa were super friendly as well booked a taxi for us to the airport.  Very happy with our stay and will definitely come back. Thank you :) Great location, real Parisian vibes with great places to eat downstairs and the Rue Cler market. Walking distant to Eiffel Tower and metro station. Staff are lovely and incredibly helpful. They really did whatever they could to make out stay comfortable. Our room was really clean with a modern design. Shower pressure 10/10 Great location, nice and tidy. Friendly serviceminded staff with big smiles - team Basith, Elsa & Mohamed will do that little extra to keep guests happy. Like preparing extra early breakfast at 6.20 when I was leaving at 7 am, making sure I had a good start of the day when travelling back home. The location was perfect, walking distance to the Eiffel Tower and just outside the hotel were fruit markets, restaurants, cafes, grocery shops and boulangeries. We had everything we need within our reach. Hotel staff were also nice and accommodating.  Perfect location and a very charming hotel!!  Our room was very comfortable and clean and I loved looking out the window and seeing the activity on rue Cler! The breakfast was amazing; great coffee machine and so many choices and a great value! Everyone was helpful; especially Basith who always went out of his way to make us feel welcome! Review by a Aussie… Staff very friendly, helpful & speak English. Comfortable bed , very clean & well maintained. Pretty cobbled street packed with restaurants & amazing food outlets. metro stations are several hundred meters, easy walk to Eiffel Tower. They provide a very generous cooked buffet breakfast (but not lunch/dinner). The rooms & spaces are Euro ‘cosy’. Would be happy to stay again.  Had a wonderful stay.  The location and hotel staff were wonderful.  Special thanks to the night managers Basith and Elsa who were available to help even when we came back late to the hotel from our outings.  Highly recommend this place. Perfect location…in the heart of Paris, plenty of great restaurants, cafes, fresh fruit stands, ice cream, chocolatiers within a couple of minutes walking along Rue Cler. Very clean & cozy hotel.  Our family loved staying here.  Friendly, helpful staff…Basith deserves special mention as he always greeted us warmly and provided wonderful food and activity recommendations.  Will definitely stay again next time we are in Paris. Cler Hotel is in a great location on Rue Cler; a wonderful cobbled street with plentiful restaurants along with cheese shops, chocolate shops, grocery stores (Aldi is here) an ice cream shop, fresh fruit markets right outside the hotel door. Two metro stops are within a 5 minute walk from the hotel: La Tour-Maubourg and L’Ecole-Militaire. The Eiffel Tower is a 15 minute walk. The lobby is staffed 24/7. The area is very safe. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. The rooms are comfortable and soundproofing is good-we never heard our neighbors. Clean rooms, hotel is well kept. Central air and heat. Has an elevator. I would definitely stay here again! Beautiful hotel with excellent service. The staff were very accommodating of our needs and were incredibly kind - Basith and Elsa in particular went out of their way to make us feel welcome and comfortable. Located in a cute neighborhood with lots to do as well - a great place for first time visitors to Paris. It was a fantastic hotel. The service is excellent. The rooms are clean. The staff is so nice. Basieh is the fronk desk person. He is fantatstic. All the staff is amazing. The breakfast is good. The location is awesome. They help with suit case and all. They help you plan tours. I think it is a cute hotel , I love it! The service was magnificent, Pablo was helpful when we checked in he set up a taxi to pick us up early in the next morning. Basie, & Elsa where super nice, they let us eat breakfast at 6:30 because our taxi was going to be there at 7:00am! We were needing to eat because I take medication with food. Breakfast was great too! Overall I recommend this small yet cute, comfy and clean hotel! Can't recommend this hotel enough!! Friendly customer service, especially Basith who was happy to help us with everything. The room itself was clean, functional and comfortable. Location was perfect we felt very safe in this area so it was well worth the price you're paying. Walkable to the Eiffel Tower as well.  Gave this Hotel a 5 five star due to reasons only, 1st is the location and 2nd the staff.  Location is always a key when you're on vacation.  My wife wants to be close to the Eiffel Tower, and we re very fortunate to discover this hotel.  It's in a great location, Rue cler has everything you need in that street.   Staff are very friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  Our room was cleaned every single day.   Staff greets you  every day and assists you in every possible way.   Couldn't pick a better hotel. The hotel s located in the Rue Cler district and right in the middle of most of what Paris has to offer. This allowed us to walk to all of the sights we wanted to visit (Louvre, Rodin, Army museums, Eifel Tower etc.). The room was clean and had all the amenities we required, the staff was extremely helpful and the front desk is manned 24/7. The only issue we had was some noisy neighbors in the next room which wasn't the fault of the hotel. I will stay here again the next time we visit Paris. The hotel is really pretty and the rooms comfortable, as well as the help received from the staff was pivotal for my work journey.  Basith's availability and gentleness were really important during my stay. Wonderful hotel. Great staff. The most perfect location to visit all sights by foot or open top bus.  Very friendly staff . Thank you Baset. The street outside the hotel ( mostly pedestrian) had lots of cafes , shops , restaurants, food stalls ( organic) and great people watching spot with a cafe crème.  When I return will stay again with my partner. Caters for all types of trips .. business/ friends or partner. basith was an insane help with everything we needed and more . great guy and experience . the hotel was great as well ! very fun and local street with so much good stuff . enjoyed our time 100% recommend  Loved the room, although a little small yet cozy, the view of the Eiffel tower was phenomenal! Highly recommend staying here, and will stay here again when I return.  Customer service was amazing as well, very easy going and helpful as well as providing great information for tourists! Our family, Mom, Dad, Son and his Fiancé spent a wonderful week in Paris during October. We had 2 rooms at the Cler Hotel, 24 Rue Cler, fronting the street. Our rooms were attractive, comfortable, well appointed, clean, and quiet. There was a delicious and varied breakfast available. The hotel staff were attentive, friendly, and eager to help us arrange activities, plan Metro routes, and make reservations. The location in the heart of the Rue Cler neighborhood was incredible! We were so close to the Eiffel Tower, Army Museum and Napoleon’s Tomb, Rodin Museum, the Seine River, and the Ecole Militaire Metro stop, not to mention numerous eateries of all types. (A great tip is to bring a Rick Steves’ guide book for a nice discount.) We highly recommend the Cler Hotel and would The staff at the reception are super nice, hotel very well located (short walk to metro and Eiffel Tower) nice deco and super clean. The street has a supermarket and several cozy bistro’s. Highly recommended for couples for a romantic weekend. Husband, myself and teenager in one cozy room and our friends in a room overlooking the Eiffel Tower!  Modern, clean, neat spaces and rooms; helpful and kind staff; fantastic location; great outdoor space; delicious breakfast with many options.  We would definitely stay here again.  Loved it! The place around here is so clean and safe.  This is a nice hotel.  And staff here, Basith is very kind and taught a lot. From here, we can go the tower Eiffle every day. And it's very near from a Metro station. My wife and I stayed at the Cler Hotel for one night on our way to the southwest of France. We were impressed with the hotel, which we found to be clean, cozy, and well run. The front desk staff is available 24/7. The location is excellent. It is walking distance to the Eiffel Tower and numerous bars, cafes and restaurants. I would be remiss not to mention Mohamed, who was working at the front desk during the night of our stay. We were up at 3:30 AM as we were adjusting to the time difference. We went down to the front desk for additional coffee. Mohamed sat with us in the breakfast area for coffee and chocolates. We enjoyed conversing with Mohamed. He also provided us with information on places to eat and see during the day before we left Paris. We would definitely stay here\"},\n",

It was my wifes birthday on our visit and the amazing staff put birthday balloons up all over the room & amazing cake We stayed at the Hotel Marignan for our 25th wedding anniversary and booked a larger room with a balcony facing the Eiffel Tower. I had asked them to do something special for the lady and they decorated the bed with flowers, the bathroom with roses and kept some fresh chocolates on our arrival. They also had a very welcoming card wishing us on our anniversary. Suffice it to say, the check-in was smooth and we had a great experience settling in.  During the stay the staff was extremely helpful with giving extra bottles of water, cleaning the room more than once a day, calling for a taxi and the breakfast which was included was a great start to the day. They booked tickets for the Moulin Rouge when we could not get tickets from their web, booked the Seine River cruise, and many The hotel is perfectly located near the Champs Elyesses. Rooms are very small and it is quite noisy but overall a good visit. Pricing IMO is too high for this space. You are def paying for location and not to be in the room though… Really happy we decided to pick this great hotel. We were greeted by very friendly staff . We decided to switch rooms and the staff showed us 3 separate beautiful rooms. They accommodated us quickly.We decided on an Eiffel Tower view and it didn’t disappoint. Definitely will be referring friends and family as we are in Paris very often. Great location- close to all stores, restaurants and in a perfect location to reach museums and other great attractions . Definitely if you want a nice hotel for a great price and wonderful service- this is your place. 5 stars  This is a Great hotel, with some amazing staff, especially Faty, Very helpfull people. Great in communication before the stay and during our stay. The suite was outstanding, with an amazing view on the Eifel tower Our wedding at Hôtel Marignan Champs-Élysées in October 2023 was an incredible experience. Lucie, Cécile, and the entire team were amazing to work with, guiding us seamlessly through the planning process, even from the United States. The team\\'s support on the day of the event made everything run effortlessly. The hotel itself is stunning, and we\\'re genuinely looking forward to returning the next time we\\'re in Paris. A heartfelt thank you! We very much enjoyed our stay, just about everything was perfect. The location is very good. Even though it is near Champs Elysees it is quiet during the night. Very friendly staff throughout our stay; they were available and very helpful whenever we had a question. Rooms were beautiful and spacious with a great view. Breakfast was excellent.  What a wonderful experience from the moment we set foot into the hotel to checkout. An absolutely stunning hotel where service was exceptional and staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. We mentioned in conversation that we were travelling for my wife’s birthday and when we got back to our room they had decorated the room with birthday balloons and we have cake waiting for us which was such a wonderful unexpected touch, the room we stayed in was beautiful. I can’t give enough plaudits to this wonderful hotel. We can’t wait to stay again.  Amazing Stay at Hotel Marignan. Since it was our first time in Paris, the hotel staff was so helpful, kind and attentive. They helped us with dinner reservations, suggestions on how to make our short stay so memorable. We had such a great experience at this hotel that we ended up staying the last two nights on our return from Spain before flying back to the states. The concierge was so kind and helpful and the front desk staff amd valet and house keeping, the service they provided  were the best!!  The hotel is in such a great location walking distance to many places. Thank you for your hospitality and amazing service at Hotel Marignan and making our first trip to Paris so memorable. Hope to return soon and bring my family!!   Such friendly service, staff were helpful from the first moment. Great quality linen and bath products. Food was delicious and of very high quality. Wonderful experience overall. Will definitely visit again Once in a while, you have one of those rare experiences that impressed you and made you feel so happy. Our stay at Hotel Marignan Champs-Elysees was definitely one of those. The location is so convenient, the room is generous and nice however, the staff made it so special. Everyone of the people at this hotel made you feel at home like you are family or friends to them. Well done guys, please look after your staff well! My husband and I held our wedding ceremony at the newly renovated Hotel Marignan in September 2023 and could not have been happier with our decision. The staff are absolutely incredible - they went above and beyond to not only make our planning process from overseas seamless and stress-free but were an absolute pleasure to meet and work with in person. Our ceremony was magical, thanks to the Hotel Marignan team who made everything happen without any issues. We held our ceremony on the 6th floor balcony and had the most stunning view/backdrop of the Eiffel Tower. Our curated menu for our wedding reception dinner was out of this world delicious and was complimented by a beautiful red and white wine pairing. The suite itself is breathtaking, spacious, and includes everything you Staff was very friendly, rooms were clean, breakfast was delicious.  The door to our room was very tall and heavy and hard to open for a physically, strong couple.  The lights and air-conditioning were hard to figure it out. The minimum temperature is set at 19°C, which was a little bit warmer than we like… The windows open, so that was nice we could get fresh air to cool the room off. I could have asked them to turn it down and I’m sure they would’ve but we didn’t bother. All in all we had a good experience.   It was a bit expensive for what we got but it was very nice. July, our breakfast server was particularly helpful and friendly, Providing lots of helpful information about food they they offered, the city and our further travels to Nice.  We would return to this hotel Beautiful boutique hotel. Staff are generous, very friendly and attentive. Location of the hotel is prime. Beds are very comfortable and huge. Food is far better than all the Bistros in the area. Will come back in a heartbeat. What a beautiful hotel with amazing service. My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in October. Location near Arc Triomphe and Eiffel Tower was excellent and our room was very comfy and very clean. The service was above and beyond, any little thing we asked for, we got. The concierge (Jean Francois I think was his name) super nice and helpful. All the valets (Mbaye and all the others) were so nice and helpful. We will be back. This hotel is just the bomb dot com! The rooftop bar is everything! The view of the Eiffel Tower is just chef\\'s kiss. And  the rooms are stylish and modern! And the best part? You get all of this for a really great price - especially considering the location. It\\'s just a hop, skip, and a jump away from all the Parisian action. Seriously, you need to check out this hotel. It\\'s a total game changer.  But, let\\'s be real - the Champs Elysees isn\\'t exactly our favorite spot. It\\'s basically just a tourist trap with overpriced stores selling luxury brands. But, hey, if that\\'s your thing, go for it! So happy we found this special boutique hotel, right in the middle of the golden square of Paris. Close to all the bistros, shopping, yet so peaceful and quiet. Our place in Paris in future stays for sure. We wish to thank the whole team, from the door to reception, big shout to the house-keeping team, you are world class. Thanks so much. See you again. Wonderful holiday. Helpful and kind staff. Thanks for every thing. Rooms are clean. Everyday rooms are cleaned. Breakfast is Good and delicious. Hotel is close to center and touristical places. Thanks  This is a clean, modern, slightly designer-ish hotel. They have a very nice location, just off the champ élysées avenue so it\\'s great for that. Good for taxi\\'s and Ubers, and the metro. They can get you the taxi\\'s too, get you the door, you feel special it\\'s nice. The room we stayed in had a high ceiling, and they had built a \"bathroom\" level in a way, where you took the stairs to that level inside the same room. Everything is clean, the bed is nice... there\\'s very little to fault the hotel on tbh. However, I have stayed in 5 star hotels before and this is more a 3 star than 5. The reason for that is the rooms and amneties available. It\\'s all very... well, 3 or pushing close to 4 star. For example, the reception upsold another \"better\" room on our arrival, which is something 5 This hotel had an Amazing location, beautiful suite and super friendly and helpful staff! 😍 we loved Vivek in particular! We couldn\\'t recommend this hotel enough and we will definitely be back! 10/10!  This week we have been at the hotel, and the experience has been great. The attention received by all the hotel staff was excellent, especially Mr. Mbaye, whose professionalism made our stay even better.  I recommend this hotel 100%, it is true that it is not cheap, but if you want to travel with quality and professionalism that has its price. I am sure that when I return to Paris I will come back to this hotel.  The room was very clean and the Staff lovely, everybody was always helping and doing their best. The Suite Terrasse Eiffel is amazing, the view is stunning. we can only recommend the hotel. The food is also very good and the location ist super Great accommodations, friendly staff, close to the action but quiet at night, great place for young parents with babies.   French and english speaking staff. Overall, a great experience and I would stay there again. I booked a family room at this hotel for 4 nights. When we arrived we were not given a family room; we were given an accessible room.  The photos in the ad for the room were nothing as pictured. The ad states that the room is a “triple room” and it contains a bidet. The photos also appear that the family room is split level. We were given one room with two double beds pushed together and there was no bidet. The room was also extremely dusty and was not adequately cleaned.  At this point I didn’t complain but then my children and I then showered and the bathroom completely flooded.   Furthermore, I only booked the hotel so my children and I could enjoy the view from the rooftop (which is also in the ad). When we went to have a look we were told we were unable to go there as it First class room, service and position, easy access to all of the sites. Competitive room price, breakfast very good. Staff very attentive to all of our needs. Front of house arranged all of our travel requirements.  Brilliant staff and service, room was cozy and clean! A very romantic evening view of The Eiffel tower too! The location is fantastic, just by the Champs Elysees, perfect for a stroll. Breakfast and dinner at the hotel was very enjoyable. The hotel does not have various facilities such as swimming pool or gym, and the rooms looked a little tired. However, the service was very good, and the food was, too. The location is a little noisy, being just off the Champs-Elysee, but it is a great spot for getting around. The hotel was OK. The staff and customer service was very nice. They welcome you home just like your whole family. Everyone was super nice and friendly. Thank you so much for making us feel so warm and always welcome with the happy smile on their face. My husband and I truly enjoyed our stays  Very kind staff and good rooms. From door to housekeeping all staff are very polite. Breakfast is better than expected. They cleaned and tidied room twice a day. Everywhere in Champs Elysee is very bear to the hotel. I suggest to come this hotel. We chose the hotel as a special treat for our family’s first visit to Paris and it did not disappoint. From the booking to all email communication prior to arrival to our stay, this team goes above and beyond to ensure an enjoyable visit. We arranged  to be picked up at the airport and highly recommend this service as our airport driver was wonderful. The breakfast and restaurant are amazing in both decor and food. You can enjoy a full breakfast here before going out for the day. The hotel ambiance is relaxing with lovely lounge areas and street-side tables. Our family room was a good size for our group with one triple sized bed. The only disappointment was that the rooftop terrace was closed for renovation, and we had looked forward to that. We were guided up for a look and it Amazing hotel, a hidden gem. We travel a lot, and we were pleasantly surprised with our experience at this hotel. We travelled with a kid and therefore we ordered a transfer from the airport to make sure we have s safe drive to the hotel and I am so happy we did it. Marouan (a driver) met us right after passing customs and quickly showed us to the car providing water and helping us along the way. While being very professional, Marouan truly gave us the warmest welcome in a country we have not been for 20 years and such a comfortable easy transportation after a long 10 hour flight. The staff at the reception was a 5 start level. Faty, Uliana and everyone else at the reception were so attentive and welcoming. We had a challenging personal request and we were so amazed that they It was really amazing experience and the staff were so supportive and helpful, especially Fatii and Empay. And they help me to book a van to the airport with minimum charge. I will definitely come back to this hotel in the future. My only comment rooms was small in compare to the cost  Excellent service and wonderful stay at this centrally located Parisian hotel. Leah from the entire team was exceptional when it came to service and ensuring we had a fantastic stay! Highly recommend for quality, service and location.  I stayed at the hotel for the fourth time. I always have a good experience in my stays. The staff are always very attentive and helpful. We had a great service by mr Marouan (chauffeur), mr Jean Francois (concierge  ) and everyone who made our stay a great experience.  Fantastic location, lovely rooms, Friendly and welcoming staff from reception, concierge, doorman to the entire event crew . My friend and I had a great experience during the stay and the Bastille day event at the rooftop was Such a memorable experience! It was a fun time w great vibe on top of the beautiful view! Very good hotel near the Champs-Elysees.  The superior rooms are very nice and a good size.  The Eiffel Tower suite has an excellent view of the Eiffel Tower. Within walking distance of many things but far enough away from the Champs to feel like you are not right in the middle of a tourist spot.  The thing that makes this hotel is the staff.  They are helpful and willing to do anything they can to make your stay perfect.   Excellent customer service , staff were super nice and helpful and couldn’t do enough for you .  definitely will go back  . The location was really great .rooms were nice and clean ,would definitely recommend this hotel .  We found this gem due to its location and the fact we were there during a busy time when the top hotels were charging outrageous prices. The old but updated hotel has a friendly staff and small but modern rooms accessed by a two person lift. The lobby restaurant serves a continental breakfast and more with a good coffee and regular bar. The door and desk staff are friendly and speak English and you are steps from the Champs Elysees, as well as the Georges V and some popular restaurants. If you came for shopping, you’re only a block away from the Rodeo Drive of Paris so don’t forget your passport to save on the VAT Tax later. Celebs stay here to escape the limelight so you may catch a familiar face and the Grand Dame owner is there daily although not conspicuous. The team at Hotel Marignan was really great at helping us get our vowel renewal event on their rooftop set up. From the cake to coordinating the details of the date we are forever greatful. The location is really great and the staff is really friendly and prepared to help with whatever you need. The hotel was phenomenal. The beds were so comfortable and the service was superb. The car service was easily available for our family during our stay. The hotel is in a location where luxury stores are less than a block away and champs elysee and the arc are at walking distance. Highly recommended for families. '},\n",

       "  'concatenated_reviews': \"I loved staying at PiaPia in particular because of the lovely and helpful staff. The location is also great because of its proximity to Bastille and Le Marais. The local bistro L'Escale at 5 min walking from the hotel is also worth a lunch or dinner. We were here for my daughter's 1st PASS held in Expo Montreuil. Very clean, well designed for both work and tourism. Excellent access to métro and to exam venue. Welcoming and professionnel staff. We were very happy to have discovered Piapia at the last minute.  Overall, we had a pleasant stay. The room was clean and modern with a touch of Parisian flair. The staff was always polite and eager to help. The ability to have hot drinks free of charge is a nice touch.   The only thing that needs to be improved lies in the breakfast. While the options are fresh, it is exactly the same every single day. Introducing some variety in options would engage the experience.  This is a review I wish I read before booking a classic double room at Piapia hotel.   I liked the ambience and decor of the hotel,\\xa0 the friendly staff, nice toiletries in the shower,\\xa0 curtains that block the light,\\xa0 there is a machine next to reception that you can use for coffee and hot chocolate any time of the day for free, comfortable bed and pillows, very close to a metro station, various shops nearby. Breakfast was delicious, small selection but adequate for my taste. Spotlessly clean. Easy access from and to CDG airport.   I did not like how small the classic room was. Fortunately we traveled with backpacks only, because if we had luggage I don't know where we would put them. The room is around 10 square meters, shower and toilet included. There are only two hangers for The hotel looks very nice, it is located near the metro/bus/tram station (in 20 minutes you are at the Louvre museum). It is clean and comfortable, the room and the bathroom are really big. The breakfast is international, the team is kind and friendly. We appreciated your the idea of offering hot beverages and water at all times (a hot chocolate is what you need during a cold winter night).  You will have all you need to spend a lovely break in Paris! To make the stay perfect, we just suggest to include a chair and a wardrobe since there is enough space in the room. Many thanks and see you again! This was a great base to explore Paris with our toddler. The rooms were of a fairly generous (for Paris!) size, clean, tylish and the complimentary coffee a bonus. We asked for a cot for our 15 month old and this was ready and set up in our room when we arrived. Don't bother with the breakfast which at €18pp was steep considering the limited offering. I would recommend visiting one of the many boulangeries instead and buying a croissant or two for the mornings. This was a last minute hotel booking for the rugby World Cup. The hotel was one metro stop from the main train station, then a 5min walk to hotel.  The room was clean and tidy with ample space for unpacking clothes. I have noted people commenting there was no door for toilet however in the UK both the toilet and shower are in the same room so unsure why this was a problem as there is a door for the bathroom it’s self. The shower cubicle was spacious, and good shower with free toiletries. My only thought would be putting in a full length mirror in the room as the only mirror is in the bathroom none in the actual room.  I would definitely stay here again, lots of bars, restaurants, bakeries and patisseries near by.  A decent, little hotel at the border of zone 1 and 2 of Paris.  Staff were really friendly and accommodating. We were in a family room (with a double and single bed). The room was clean, and well-presented but it was pretty small for 3 people. Also the bathroom didn't have a door - which was a bit of surprise as there was no mention of it in the site when we looked.  Although we had to resort to using the bathroom without a door since we were already there, this would have definitely been a deal breaker for us if we knew about it earlier. There was a door separating the w/c though. You can help yourselves to free (good) coffee throughout your stay, which was a nice perk.   In terms of location and commute, the hotel was short 5-8 min walk to metro train lines - Line 1 and Line 9 Excellent hotel, beds were so comfortable and rooms were clean and of a good size. My daughter and I also loved the free hot chocolate which we enjoyed in the outdoor patio area every evening. Very quiet peaceful hotel, and would highly recommend. The location of the hotel is pretty good as it’s well connected to 2-3 metro lines within 5-10 minutes walking time. The immediate neighbourhood isn’t great though and while safe enough, you won’t find it nice to roam around.  The rooms are small but efficient with a comfortable bed and suitable wardrobe and bathroom.   Common spaces are lovely with a lot of seating and working options both indoors and outdoors. Very clean and well managed!  The service is perhaps the only thing that spoils an otherwise excellent experience (reason why I rate this hotel 3 instead of 4.5). Perhaps the staff is overworked or there is some other reason but they are pretty rude and unfriendly, especially in the breakfast room.   The breakfast is nothing great but like most Parisian hotels, includes Cosy small boutique hotel. Modern and clean with a very friendly and caring staff. Highly Recommended.  Only negative is that it is not a very exciting area (nothing really to discover and not very exciting restaurants), but with subway line 1 just one minute from the hotel it is very practical to be anywhere within 20 minutes. The Piapia Hotel in Paris was a reasonably priced place to stay in Paris.  Our five-day visit was very busy and the hotel was a good resting spot away from the touristy areas.  The metro and the bus stops were within easy walking distance, the breakfast was abundant and good, staff were helpful and friendly, and there is a little cafe/bar a few doors down that we quite enjoyed.  The only thing I could suggest is better lighting, perhaps overhead in addition to the bedside area.  The Room was quiet and nice. With the three of us a bit crowded but ok.Short distance to walk to the Metro station. Breakfast Buffet was good. All was clean and the staff was very friendly. We were happy to stay there. Superb little hotel, fantastic staff, nice simple breakfast buffet with scrambled eggs and bacon, bread rolls, pastries, cheeses and cured meats. Pricing is OK for Paris. My (budget by choice) room was on the small side but very nice all the same. I'm coming back.  Chose this hotel as close enough to spend a few days travelling to Disney and a few days seeing the sights around Paris. The hotel is close to metro and has a supermarket and several nice eateries local for the nights we arrived back from Disney and needed to eat. La sabonne nearby is lovely.  The hotel is super clean, the rooms were cleaned so well every morning. The rooms are well decorated and bathrooms feel lovely and new. The free water and hot drinks throughout the day was a godsend, getting a coffee in the morning and hot chocolate at night was great touch. We didn’t have breakfast but it looked bustling with a great choice of food.  Our only criticism would be the room. As a family of 5 we booked a family room so expected a suite or interconnecting rooms. We arrived late   Good hotel located  near Nation. Well served  by metro. Very confortable, top breakfast, small but confortable room, clean with super maintenance of rooms and structure. Good amenities ( coffee, tea, camomille etc, thoughout the day ). Wormely suggested. Price in line with service given. Cute concept. Clean. Great Value. Near the Metro. Well maintained. Reataurant and shops all around. If you’re out touring and need a good sleep, this is where you go.  I will recommend to friends and family. For context, my husband and I stayed here for 3 nights.   Pros about this hotel -Very clean! The housekeeping staff were amazing and even gently put our suitcases away  -Staff is kind   Cons about this hotel -This hotel is very east from the city center. Every site was about 30 minute train ride (which are very packed mind you). At times we just opted to walk for that reason  -Rooms are tiny! I mean very tiny! There wasn't much space to put our luggage and we had to get creative. The room size won't be a nuisance to solo travelers, but I would not recommend if you are a couple or if someone in your party is 6 foot ( 1.8 meters) or taller  -Breakfast was pricey for what is offered (basic croissants, orange juice and slices of bread with jam)  -The room was very cold at night and Nice interior and clean (with even a nice smell). Rain shower is amazing and the ring light in the bathroom works perfect for makeup. If we go to Paris again, I would stay here again. Would recommend! I would gladly recommend the PiaPia to anyone staying in the 20th arondisement in Paris. It is clean and very safe. The staff were very kind and knew English. The room was good sized by European standards and was very comfortable. It was easily within walking distance to the metro which made it a great starting point for seeing the city. I found this hotel to be 3 star, but it surpassed many 4 star hotels I've been to.  Great hotel, very friendly staff, everywhere clean, small, but cosy room.  Several metro and bus stops near the hotel. I will stay here again next time I visit Paris. - Ideal location in an area called Porte de Vincennes around 15-20 mins from central Paris. - Tube station is within 2 mins walking distance if that.  - Clean, modern and warm with good furnishings and comfortable bed.  - Friendly staff with good tips for travellers - they even provide free refreshments whenever you need.  - Not too expensive room rates for Paris  - Really good amenities- the shower was great although a little on the small side.  - The room overall is small but for sight seeing where you’re not spending much time in the hotel it wasn’t really a problem.    Highly recommended as we didn’t have any complaints!   P.s there’s a great boulangerie across the road called Maison Cailleaud - almond crossiant and pain au chocolat which were really tasty!!   Thank you Nice, clean room; very friendly staff! We spent two nights in the hotel PiaPia. My husband enjoyed the always available free coffee. The breakfast buffet looked nice although we had decided to go put and have breakfast in one of the Parisian bakeries. Hotel is cozy, in a good location, and staff is very friendly. Noise from hallway can be heard in the rooms, and space is tight if sofa bed is opened. And when I say tight, it’s TIGHT! No parking available but there’s a parking garage about a 7 minute walk away.  Very good Place Hood Staff Cleaned. But the only problem is Room was so Small. And There was no Bed Table. Next door Guests when use toilet i used to heard noise of their flush in my room. Amd it was a loud.  (+)  Clean good hotel located in quite area near to metro line M1,  friendly staff in the reception  (-) We had  just 1 soap for two people for 4 days. Finally we request one more soap for the 5-th day. I understand that it's a crisis time, but I don't think that saving money on hygiene is a good solution. Also we had only 2 times water bottles in the room for period of 5 days. I want clean and quiet and that's what I got and what is most important to me.  So, I can forgive that the room was quite small.  The breakfast was great and the staff was helpful and pleasant. Close to M1 Metro line, which is very handy. The hotel is new renovated. We booked the deluxe room because we need a spacious bed. The room was nice and clean. For our room we have a bathtub, two bathroom sinks and separated toilet. There's a safe deposit box, coffee machine. The breakfast was good. As a critique, the height of the tables and the chairs at the breakfast room is too low. So it's not really comfortable to sit. The location is bit far from the central but there's a metro station 200 m from the hotel, so if you have time to explore and are fit, it should not be a problem. The staff were nice and friendly. There are coffee machine that can be use freely all day. Overall it's a really nice hotel. Very good and clean hotel. Breakfast was very good and free coffee all day and night. Excellent staff and very helpful. Cliose to metro, station and restaurants nearby.  Could not have stayed in a netter hotel. Would highly recommend this hotel. The room was clean and comfortable, the staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good. The hotel was closely related to public transport facilities making it a good place to make trips to the city. It’s a very nice place where to stay in paris! The rooms are very nice  especially the DELUXE ONE.. the staff are very helpful and nice also!Will stay again when we will had a chance to comeback.. MERCI! This hotel is perfectly located away from hustle and bustle but next to 2 metro stations minutes walk away to get you quickly to anywhere in Paris. The staff are the nicest people you can meet. Rooms are not big but on a budget a bargain, I went on trip advisor found cheapest rate went to Expedia as member and a discount was applied. This hotel is 50 yards away from a pub with good food and they all speak better English than us Geordies. My only  downside was the flight with Vueling airline. We arrived at ORLY for flight to  find it cancelled. We expected they would put us in hotel and arrange flight to Newcastle, They left us stranded my wife 74 Yrs old with memory problems and me 71 yrs old today deaf and with heart problem. We had to get to other airport book a hotel book The hotel was recently renovated, so everything is in top condition. Air conditioning also works well, which was a big plus, as the summer weather reached 40 degrees. The staff was friendly and welcoming. And the location near the metro station was super handy. I would choose this hotel again.  The Piapia hotel is a decent place but incredibly small, to the point that you can move around in the bathroom (or in the room) without hitting a wall. Breakfast is ok, wifi is good, sound isolation between room is not great.  Overall it’s a decent stay but nothing above average. The stay in the city of Paris with the family in Pia Pia was excellent. The perfect short distance to the Metro made us explore the city easily. The hotel is stylish, clean and really comfortable for a three-star hotel. We would recommend it for any family stay in Paris. This hotel is in a perfect location, out of the hustle and bustle but right next to bus stops and metros that take you anywhere you want to go in around 30 mins. The reception staff were always friendly and helpful when we told them our fridge didn’t work (they replaced it!) and got us an extra pillow.  Breakfast was definitely worth the extra small amount we added on booking - a great selection and really fresh.  The bed was super comfy and our room (deluxe) was spacious, with big windows, a tv, and really nice double sink in the bathroom.  I would definitely go back there! I would highly recommend Hotel Piapia. The staff at reception were always very welcoming and helpful. The hotel was very clean and the bed was so comfortable! The location felt very safe and had great transportation links. Would recommend to friends and family! Room i got was really to small even by paris standards. Can not put down luggage or even toilet bag in the bathroom. Als decoration feels bit like mercure hotel so not very premium. Bathroom itself is nice but to small to do anything. No waste basket in room so improvements can be made. Beautifully modern, wonderful decor and absolutely charming. Excellent staff. Clean and spotless throughout. Showers amazing and rooms small but comfortable.  Location good - close to the Porte de Vincennes Metro and some good bar/brasseries. The hotel and the staff were just fabulous! As soon as we arrived, the staff at the front desk were warm and friendly. They very kindly upgraded our room. They were polite, funny and friendly - and this was just on arrival. The hotel itself is modern with a nice ambiance. Staff around the hotel would greet us with morning / bonjour and were smiling - all were very genuine. We had forgotten some things in the hotel and they have very kindly offered to post these goods to us - the communication is constant. We were so happy with our stay and will definitely go back! Thank you to all\"},\n",

Our room was super clean and comfortable and much more modern and spacious than we expected. We’ll be back!! Nestled in the very heart of the city, the hotel is a beacon of comfort and style that won't break the bank. The prime location ensures that you're never far from the action, whether it's exploring the museums, the vibrant cityscape or unwinding in a nearby cafe or restaurant. Step inside, and you'll be enveloped in a warm and inviting atmosphere, where every detail has been carefully curated to create the perfect blend of cosiness and contemporary design.   Perfectly located for us to walk to all our dinners, museums and sites of interest. Perfect room that was a good size vs the traditionally tiny rooms in Paris or London. Staff very friendly and super helpful. Perfect long weekend away. Def would recommend to friends.  This was our first trip to Paris, so it was a bit of a challenge to pick a hotel. I couldn’t have done better. The staff was more than helpful; and trust me, my family was very high maintenance. They kept bags for a week while we visited the countryside, and went above and beyond to accommodate a last-minute extension for some of our group. The staff completely contradicted the stereotype of unhelpful Parisians. In fact, they could teach Americans a thing or two about real customer service.  Hotel Moliere is not only a Great location, it is so Beautiful and Comfortable.  The staff at Hotel Moliere is by far the most welcoming and friendly I've ever experienced. I will be back!! I loved it!  The hotel is very clean. Our room was very nice. The staff was friendly and kind. They helped us with all our needs. The hotel is near the Louve and other museums. It is also near shopping and restaurants. It is in a perfect location. Thank you all.    This is a nice boutique property tucked in from the busy center, yet close to everything. Bus stop just a few feet away. Our room was spacious, including the bathroom. Compliments to the staff for being courteous and welcoming.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Moliere. The staff were all very helpful, friendly and efficient. Thomas even prepared coffee-to-go for us when we left at 6:30 am for the airport. We had a nice size room that was quiet, had a comfortable bed, was tastefully furnished and kept very clean. Our only regret is that we couldn't use the balcony due to winter weather.  We traveled with our little one and were moved to a better room to accommodate us as we arrived - the Executive Room. The staff could not be more helpful and lovely; the room was dead quiet in the center of Paris and gave us plenty of space on our 4-country, 15-day trip with all our luggage. Given its proximity to Palais Royal, local restaurants (mostly Franco-Japanese, though), the Louvre, and the Xmas market in the Tuileries, we were looking for a place in this area. The hotel was impeccable, quiet, clean, and well-appointed, and breakfast was lovely - again, enjoying the zen-like serenity, although there were also other choices just outside. I definitely would recommend it and stay again. To be aware, though, the area has developed into a sophisticated Japanese/Asian-French The location is quiet in a little street yet it is very walkable. We love our stay and got a little extra perk. My daughter loved the room so much she didn't want to go out. Had to force her a little. Service was top notch. We were made to feel important. Would very much love to come back again. Merci. 😊 Hotel Molière is a little gem in the First Arrondissement. Professional and courteous staff, in a cosy and clean establishment. We had great welcome drinks and chocolate in our suite. The hotel has been nicely decorated for Christmas. This is a great hotel in great location.  Staff were very friendly and for my wife's birthday we had fantastic upgrade.  Room was amazing and staff were so helpful.  Everything very clean and great layout.   The honesty bar a great idea.  I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking to stay in Paris. We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Hotel Moliere. Everyone at the hotel was fantastic, our rooms were large by Paris standards, bed was extremely comfortable, breakfast was delicious, location convenient to the Louvre, Palais Royal, Opera, Galleries Lafayette, many Metro stops, Pierre Herme, Cedric Grolet…the list goes on and on. We would gladly return to this hotel if in Paris again! Thank you for a wonderful stay! Wonderful experience as the staff was excellent and made you feel at home. Location is top notch as you’re near a few of the great landmarks and gardens, as well as, surrounded by great cafes and shopping. Highly recommended! We spent three enjoyable nights at Hotel Moliere and would give it a highly positive rating. It is tucked away on a quiet street just a 10 minute walk from the Louvre and the Seine river. The reception and breakfast room were compact but, in my opinion, added to the hotel's charm. Our premium room was well appointed and immaculately clean; nothing to complain about. All staff were exceptionally polite and helpful, particularly the front desk clerk who grew up in Indonesia and is superbly multi-lingual. We'd stay here again on a future trip to Paris. Great cozy place with friendly staff. Unbeatable location, comfortable, functional room. Sauna is a great addition for fall and winter time. Staff is very friendly and professional. I would recommend this place to my family and friends.  I had stayed with family once in 2011 and we loved the central location. This time I was visiting solo after visiting friends in Genève and Hamburg. I was elated by the renovation, especially the elevator 😉. But most of all the kind and thoughtful staff. All three! Hard to find! Our room was spacious and extremely comfortable. Great shower and tub. Cute breakfast room with impeccable service. Pricey but everything was walking distance. Awesome restaurants really close by. We had a wonderful stay at Hotel Moliere.  The room and bath were quiet, spacious and clean.  The staff was friendly, helpful and accommodating.  Hotel is walking distance to many museums, shopping and restaurants.  I would highly recommend and would stay here again! We recently stayed at the Moliere. It was our first time at the hotel, but our 10th time in Paris. Evaluating all factors, we put the Moliere at the top of our list. The location is very central on a quiet street in the 1st A. It is an easy walk to the Louvre, Orsay, and the Tuileries. The hotel was immaculate and very well maintained. In this era of bedbugs, you don't have to worry about the Moliere. Absolutely spotless. The front desk is very helpful and cordial. There is a good French bakery, Asian owned, right next door. There is a very nice market two short blocks away. There is a small refrigerator in the room, and you can store a few food items in it. The hotel is not cheap, but it is a good value taking all factors into consideration. Highly recommended.               Stayed for a week and had a wonderful experience.  Lobby area is charming with little touches like fruit infused water, coffee/tea, and an honesty bar. I splurged on a Deluxe Room, and it was very clean, spacious, had a comfortable bed, and with charming and unique furnishings.  I requested a higher floor, so noise was not an issue.  High end Nuxe toiletries and excellent Wi-Fi.  I don't usually eat a lot for breakfast, which was included in the rate, but enjoyed the baguettes, croissants, jam, and especially the homemade quiche.    Neighborhood is one of the best.  Near Avenue de l'Opera and Palais Royal and easy walking to the Rive Gauche.  Every hotel staff member is kind, courteous, and ready to help with restaurant advice, directions, etc.  I plan to make Hotel Moliere my Travelled with another couple and we stayed for 3 nights and an additional night after visiting the countryside.  Highly recommend.  Excellent location near Louvre and other key sites.  We really enjoyed the helpfulness of the staff and the hospitality there including the delicious breakfast and refreshments offered. Rooms have good amenities but are small and varied.  We didn't love the bathroom layout with a glass wall that didn't offer much privacy. Very nice boutique hotel , room needed airing so had to open windows , breakfast was nice but never ready at 7.00 best to wait till 7.30 , but staff friendly and helpful would recommend this hotel was very central  I travelled for work on this trip. The staff were warm and welcoming. The room was clean, comfortable & beautiful. I would highly recommend staying at Hotel Moliere for all of the above and it’s very quiet. OMG! This hotel is pure magic! it made my stay in Paris beyond memorable. My room had a balcony and I felt I was living in Paris for years haha, I used their facilities like Hamman and Sauna and I felt so rested and so soothed. Staff are very friendly and helpful, they made me feel home and were super helpful. I felt very emotional when I left the hotel, I wanted to stay more, but I will come back! We stayed here as the culmination of a seven week celebration of our 50th wedding anniversary. The staff at this hotel made the experience more than special. Everyone involved from the front desk staff to all the folks who work so hard behind the scenes but are never seen went out of their way to help us celebrate our special event. We were at the hotel for 4 nights and we wished we had the time to stay even longer!! If you are looking for a well located hotel that is easy walking distance from the Louvre and other main attractions in Paris look no further. This is the place to stay!! Most rooms are facing a small street across an Asian restaurant. The minute you open the door your whole room smells.  There is also a garbage station right in front so early in the morning you the the garbage pickup. The windows are not very noise cancelling. Shower was broken and I cut my hand while operating it. It also wasn’t fixed during our stay. One of the quietest rooms I ever slept in in Paris. Staff is very attentive. The room is very clean, no bedbugs! Breakfast is prepared with lots of love for details. If you want to visit the Louvre, well, this is a very convenient hotel to stay at. Enjoy. The hotel was great - there was always water, tea, coffee and fruit available in the lobby for no charge. The staff was super accommodating and helped us with special requests we had. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was great, and the hotel / room was very clean. The location was excellent - we easily got around to several neighbors by foot and/or train  I would definitely recommend this hotel or stay there again myself!  Spacious clean quiet room, friendly and helpful and accommodating staff, a nice breakfast included. Also, awesome bathroom and shower in the room and nice views overlooking the courtyard garden. Would recommend. Lovely little hotel in perfect location. Nice staff, very helpful and the bedroom was very comfortable. Small but important criticism- the bedroom windows let in a lot of street noise at the front of the hotel. It was much quieter at the weekend. Breakfast was fresh and enjoyable if a bit cramped. Will return.  We really enjoyed the central but quiet location of the hotel. All attractions and metro station are near. Hotel is very well kept and has lovely staff. Breakfast room is small and alternatives moderate but high quality. There are plenty of nice places to have dinner on walking distance. Would come again! Enjoyed our stay here, was close walking distance to everything and being so close to Trevi fountain meant we could easily see it during less busy times. Staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms are modern and comfortable. Awesome food and fantastic value for money.  This busy canteen has the most stunning view over the lake.  Lovely friendly staff and wonderful food.  We had roast beef with yorkshire puddings (£15), stunning gravy and local veg.  Veggie option was squash and pinenut bake - also delicious.  A really lovely cup of coffee to finish and gluten free brownie.  Would definitely go back again. We very much enjoyed our stay in the Hotel Moliere. The location, staff, amenities and breakfast were all outstanding. We were just a few minutes walk from the Seine, Louvre and Musee D’Orsay. Highly recommended.  Nice, friendly and helpful staff. Very good breakfast and the room was clean and cozy! The amenities in the room were super good quality 👌🏾  Overall a great experience! we will surely stay here again :)   Every moment was great here. The staff always ready, thoughtful turndown service throughout the day, walking distance to Louvre, Tuileries, Notre Dame, the subway, the Opera and many restaurants. We were able to book the spa with sauna and steam and have it all to ourselves, meanwhile the staff thoughtfully turned down our room, turning on music and closing the curtains. New chocolates and mineral water each day. We had what must have been the best room which was top floor with a balcony overlooking the street. Lovely large bathtub, shower, good air conditioning. The breakfast which we ordered in our room price  was fantastic with many croissants, fresh fluffy scrambled eggs, bacon, fruits, as many coffees and teas as we wished, the best seating, cold cuts, yogurts, granola , My daughter and I had a wonderful stay here, staff were phenomenal and the location can't be beat. We didn't pay for breakfast at the hotel, we wanted to indulge in all Paris had to offer and sleep in  Spent a pleasant weekend in Paris. The Modigliani art exhibition, which runs until Jan 2024, is not to be missed. The hotel is nice and the room was cosy and clean. Bed and pillows comfortable.   Le bon georges et le sergent recruteur are two excellent spots to enjoy lunch and dinner.  Reception is well run and quick to go through the routine checks. Internet fast and reliable.  Breakfast: guests need to.reserve a spot in advance in order to get one table the following morning. This is not ideal if you want to sleep longer during the weekend. Glasses and cutlery were on both days dirty even though the table was set correctly. The choice is very limited and guests need to undertake a treasury hunt to discover where is the bread, where are the croissants and pains au chocolate, We had a wonderful recent stay at this hotel and can highly recommend it.  The location couldn't be beat -- minutes from the Louvre and the Tulleries as well as the metro and restaurants -and the room was tasteful, spacious, spotless, and comfortable.  Staff was very helpful both before and during our stay.  A winner!\"},\n",

This hotel was amazing, small but modern. More than enough to rest & sleep with a user friendly room technology. Exceptional experience with accommodating staff specially Solomon who assist us in our stay as well as the rest of the staff member.  Modern, Perfect, quiet, clean and quiet. Living room like home. Shower was great. Sleep on large clean and soft bed. Curtains awesome light and night that were able to control by ipad. Very friendly staff. Secure hotel and entrance with card to the floors.  I was lucky to find this hotel just off the Champs Elysees for a mini break with my daughter. Having stayed at a CitizenM hotel in London a few years ago, I didn’t hesitate to book this one. I’m so glad I did. It was fabulous and in a great location. Exceptional service! Solomon, Emma A., and Emma J. were absolutely delightful! Every interaction I had with each of them was amazing. We were initially going to check out early, but I decided to extend our stay at this hotel. I am truly glad I did since everyone we encountered at the hotel was amazing! The type of customer service we have received here is one-in-a-million! The location is perfect, the hotel is very well maintained and clean, and the breakfast was excellent. This was my first time staying at a CitizenM hotel and in Paris. I am definitely going to stay here again, as well as at other CitizenM locations, because of this wonderful experience and the modern amenities that the hotel offers. Fantastic hipster hotel with AMAZING decor and brilliant staff(ambassadors). Couldn\\'t fault it and hope to return. Compact brilliantly designed room and loved the Citizen ethos to encourage communication in communal areas.  Excellent overall!  Location, breakfast buffet, room, rooftop bar!  We booked the hotel because of the rooftop view of the Eiffel Tower and it was amazing! We paid a premium because of the holiday season and New Year but is was worth it, not to mention the you are a few steps from Champs Elysees, literally!  Wonderful shops and restaurants within walking distance and if you don’t mind walking, many major attractions of Paris are walkable! Rooms are on the small side, btw, but so are most of Parisian hotels. Amazing location for New Year’s Eve!  Roof bar had a great view of Eiffel Tower but no heaters so bring something warm ( they did have a few blankets near entrance) Cafe azur is a few minutes walk away and has Amazing breakfasts but sometimes bit of a queue. Hotel staff were genuinely friendly, natural and chatty , really enjoyed talking to them.  We recently had a most enjoyable stay at this hotel, and we wanted to share our satisfaction. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by an extremely warm and attentive staff, which greatly contributed to making our stay memorable.  The rooms were comfortable, clean, and well-appointed, providing a conducive environment for relaxation. We were pleasantly surprised by the state-of-the-art technology in the room, including the tablet that allowed us to control every aspect of the environment.  The hotel\\'s location, just steps away from the Champs-Élysées, was also a major asset. It made accessing local attractions easy and added a special touch to our stay.  In summary, our getaway was very satisfying, and we wanted to commend the team for their professionalism. We highly Efficient hotel, friendly staff, clean, great amenities. If this is the part of Paris you want to stay in, you couldn\\'t do better - affordable, yet right next to the most upmarket shops in the city. Just off the Champs-Élysées, and in walking distance of Arc de Triomphe, Place de la Concorde and Jardin des Tuileries. A choice Métro stations nearby.  The rooms are small, but the lounges are comfy with plenty of room to relax. Nice breakfast, with pastries and baguette, hot food, pancakes, fresh fruit, cheeses and coffee. The restaurant is nice and affordable too.  Must meet the 4-star level and provide services included by default. You lack basic things. Your hotel is a maximum of 2 stars, and then only for the location. Only your price corresponds to the 4 star level. We spent 3 days in Paris for sightseeing and stayed at citizenM champs Élysée. The location was perfect, and so was the hotel and the staff! We definitely come back to this hotel again and also recommend it to others!  Best location surrounded by restaurants and right near the Metro Station.  Then along came the rooftop bar.  Wow...what can be said...amazing staff, great range of drinks.  The best view of the Eiffel Tower and to walk outside the front on to the Champs-Elysees Walk out the front and you are smack bang in the middle of Champs-Elysees.  2 minute walk to the Metro Station and restaurants everywhere.  All the staff are so friendly, and most importantly, the roof top bar.  The best view of the Eiffel Tower and at night it is amazing. All excellent- already looking forward to our return! And, on top of the hospitality, the breakfast buffet was varied with delicious fresh food and baked goods.It’s full service bar is a special treat after a full day of seeing Paris. Thank you. Letting alone its perfect location, the hotel has very helpful and friendly staff, is very clean and as all hotels of this chain, boasts smart hotel rooms. Breakfast is more than decent, nevertheless it cold be a bit more rich If you are looking for a great location in Paris close to all the places of interest, then this is the place to be. Restaurants, shops and a vibrant atmosphere make this a great place to be. The hotel is excellent value for money. You won’t be disappointed  CitizenM is a style unto itself.  Absolutely my new favorite hotel!  This one is just steps off the Champs-Elysees so pretty much perfect!  The Rooftop bar with view of Eiffel Tower at night was a great plus as well! It was such amazing stay at this hote, the service and the team was exceptional and the location was the best as it is in the heart of paris and 5 mins from metro, as well the eiffel tower view from rooftop bar was amazing ♥️ i liked every detail of the hotel,  Special thanks to rachel Lost my luggage (airplane to blame) but staff was very helpful. Very good location in the middle of the city and near major metro lines. Restaurants and supermarkets (monoprix at the opposite of the hotel) around the corner. like the hot shower too.                                                                                                              The hotel and service is exceptional. It is very good located, you can walk almost everywhere. The people that work there are allways trying to help, the hotel is very clean, the con mon áreas are great, we really enjoyed our stay. I cannot express how much I did NOT like this place. The breakfast was okay, and the location was fine EXCEPT FROM A SAFETY ASPECT!  The people passed out in front had total access to the elevator and all they had to do was stay on the elevator until someone with a keycard got in and went to a floor. Then they were free to wander around.  There was no staff to keep people safe.  One homeless guy stayed in there for hours, going from floor to floor and we felt completely UNSAFE.  You wouldn\\'t know this was a hotel from the front. You step over people passed out on the sidewalk, into a dirty 10x10 \"foyer\" with only elevators. You can only get to the lobby, which was okay.  Once in the lobby, you have to check yourself in and program your own keycard.  The rooms are beyond tiny and I was one week in this hotel and loved to stay there. It was perfect. I was in perfect condition at work every day because of the wonderfull time I spend in the morning and evening in this hotel. The service was perfect, everything was tasty, the ambassadors were very helpful and nice. Thanks to everyone. My husband did all the research for our dream trip to Paris and he chose the Citizen M for our hotel. This is a hidden gem with a great location right off of the Champs-Elysees.  The hotel has such a great vibe and we loved the decor. From the moment we entered the reception area, to the moment we checked out, we were treated wonderfully by the entire staff especially Solomon. He had a great deal of patience as my husband was picking his brain about the hotel and the area.  The hotel is in a great location to many high-end stores, as well as the many area attractions. The breakfast was plentiful and we would recommend paying for it when booking. The rooms are small, as others have said, but we didn’t have an issue with ours. Everything in the room was operated through the iPad We arrived early from our long flight and were told it was full so room wouldn’t be available until 2. We hung out in the well decorated and spacious lounge area for a couple of hours just resting and recharging . About noon we decided to check our bags with Irena, but she surprised us by saying there was a room available for us😊 Great breakfast, location , and rooftop bar. Very appreciative of the service here and would totally recommend and return! Great location, nice hotel with excellent mingling areas, super breakfast and nice designer rooms. Tech is cool but when not perfectly setup (like the blinds) also a hazel. I will be back at CitizenM.  For those looking for a great location, at a walkable distance from Eiffel Tower, Sien River, Arc de Triomphe, in the middle of Champs Elysse, this is the place. Ideal for couples. Great Breakfast. Great Rooftop with a view of the Tower.  Had a brilliant stay here, the location cannot be beat! The room was small but it was very cleverly laid out and has everything you need, including a fridge, iron etc. The decor is very interesting with lots of artwork around and the lobby/dining areas were a great place to hang out.  The staff were all brilliant, very helpful during check in/out and service during breakfast was always attentive. The breakfast was also a real highlight, lots of choice available with fresh pastries and well made coffee. There\\'s a monoprix right outside which was very handy and obviously tonnes of shops and restaurants around. Stayed 3 nights to watch the World Cup rugby in Paris. Excellent choice of hotel.  I’m a regular at CitizenM in London and Rotterdam and this one in Paris was just as good. Great formula. Very convenient location. Exceptional staff and super clean rooms. I saw their staff wiping down the common area, including the lounge couch, thoroughly early in the morning. Their ambassadors/staff seem to be trained in all areas, talented, hard working, and super friendly. We loved their breakfast! High quality food and great variety. Croissants are super good like what you’d expect at 4 star pastry shops in Paris, and their iced latte is the best I had during this trip.  What a great Hotel. Perfect location, very welcoming staff, well thought out and very modern public areas and the rooms, although small tick all the boxes considering the price. Great sleep, an excellent shower and everything worked - admittedly I was alone so just maybe a little tight in the room if my wife came along. Highly recommended, great set-up. This was my first stay and experience with CitizenMl I would recommend adding a microwave and coffee machine to the rooms.  All the ambassadors were friendly and helpful throughout my stay in Paris.  Merci / Thank-you CitizenM Champs Elysées is a great place and location to stay in Paris. It is within walking distance from one of France\\'s iconic monuments, the Arc de Triomphe. Further, this CitizenM branch is within proximity of the Metro Charles de Gaulle - Étoile. The hotel guests are in for a treat as there are stores for both luxury and quotidian shopping that line the grand boulevard. Numerous cafés, restaurants are also within walking distance of the hotel, which allows hotel guests to start their day or night with a multitude of options to grab something to eat or drink at. One of the best features of this hotel is its staff or ambassadors. The ambassadors are extremely friendly, impeccable and professional. They made sure that each and every hotel guest feels at home. The ambassadors This is probably the friendliest hotel chain in the world. The staff are super helpful and even the guests are helpful and friendly. The design features and the complete control we had over our stay was the highlight of our stay.  the hotel was an excellent surprise and I was able to rest during busy days in Paris. The fact that we can control the entire room and stay via iPad or cell phone makes life much easier as a foreigner. The staff in general is very polite and attentive except for the cleaning staff who are impatient and not very polite. Our stay was fantastic. The tech, cleanliness, and friendliness of staff was all top notch. My wife and I were here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and our stay was one of the may highlights. CitizienM will definitely get our business again. Close to 3 metro stops and a monoprix for groceries. Small room. Quirky lighting and decor. Minimal English TV-no access to local sporting events or local channels. Basic housekeeping. Nice rooftop bar. Overall a great stay. The rooms were charming but small. Overall amenities were great and the staff was helpful at every request. Lack of a concierge was overcome by the knowledge of the employees. We initially didn’t like the ironing room, but the setup was actually excellent.  Forget about Marriott or Hilton.  The best of any of those hotel chains couldn\\'t compete with CitizenM. Nothing has compared to the staff, location, and quality of stay here. We will absolutely be on the lookout for one of their hotels at our future destinations.  Amazing weekend with so much to see . The hotel was the perfect location to visit all sites by walking or taking the metro that is right near the hotel .  The courtyard and the view of the Eiffel Tower was amazing.'},\n",

The food at the restaurant was incredible and we loved exploring the chateau and admiring all the period features. The gardens were magnificent. Staff at this hotel are welcoming and very helpful. Facility is clean and nicely decorated. Our room is beautiful and beds are comfortable. Location is unbeatable in terms of surrounding cafes and museums. We had a sizable room for Paris, sizable bathroom, nice bar next door, small grocery store just down the street where we able to get croissants and cheese and even special desserts, many restaurants within a five minute walk, and just ten minutes from the Louve and other major sites. Only issue is that it is not convenient to taking train to CDG Airport, must take Metro first. Fantastic hotel, centrally located! The staff from the director Marco to Anwar, the breakfast person, were the best! The room was clean, and a good size! A special shout out to assistant director Alex and front-end person Jessica. we were able to walk to almost everywhere we wanted! We visited in Spring of 2023. Every time we talk about Paris we talk about the hotel! The amazing staff added so much to our fabulous visit. The hotel is located a short walk from the Seine and the Louvre.  If you are planning a trip to Paris in 2024 and are looking for a central Left Bank location with attentive friendly staff, Hotel du Danube is a great choice. We are returning this year! The hotel is located in the city center, it’s clean and really very nice. The staff is available and pay attention to the needs of guests. I recommend this hotel if you want to feel the real and authentic atmosphere of Paris. My stay at Hotel du Danube was short but very sweet! I had the best experience and treated very kindly by the front desk staff. Daniel was beyond friendly and so funny and the gentleman who helped get me a taxi this morning was also very friendly however I failed to get his name, shame on me. There were some pros and cons to my room though.   Pros: I was upgraded from a single to a double room upon my check in which was a nice surprise. The room was still small but for a solo traveler who spent all day outside walking, it was perfect. The tv didn’t work for me but I had no use for it really. The bed was a little hard but still comfortable while the pillows were super nice and soft. The shower was stocked with toiletries and L’Occitane shampoo + conditioner.   Cons: The toilet is A lovely, cozy, charming hotel in perfect location! This is our second stay and we enjoyed it despite ongoing repairs. The staff is wonderful and does everything to make one comfortable. The rooms are generous size for a European hotel. Great to have a coffee/tea maker in the room with nice selection of Dammann tea. L'Occitaine de Provence shampoo/conditioner/body wash and lotion adds a classy touch!   We always have breakfast in the hotel - the breakfast room is lovely, selection is really nice and one can order additional items if needed.  One is greeted by Anwar's beautiful sunny smile that lights up the whole space! He makes you feel like visiting friends and having a great time!   We wish every member of the staff a wonderful holiday season, joy and happiness!   Thank you Hotel Danube is a gem of a hotel in the centre of Paris. Every single staff member was helpful, friendly and kind. There were 4 of us staying as friends in 2 rooms with single beds. The beds were really comfortable, rooms large and everything worked well in the room. The breakfast was a continental one with muesli, yogurt, fruit compotes, fresh fruit, fruit salad, fresh orange, corn flakes, pastries and plenty of tea and coffee. Lovely breakfast provided you don’t want a cooked breakfast.  There is a central area downstairs to sit in which was comfortable. Thank you for a lovely stay!! We will be back!! Hotel Danube wraps it's warm welcome around you as comfortably as its renowned soft pillows and sumptuous mattresses.  This gem of a hotel will make your smile as wide as Marco's, the Hotel manager, whose pleasure and pride in his work is mirrored in each and every one of the wonderful staff. Situated in the heart of the Latin Quarter, it is the perfect spot to explore the beautiful, quirky and elegant shops of this special corner of Paris.  I cannot recommend Hotel Danube highly enough. This was a wonderful, last-minute find.  When American Airlines canceled my flight on a Saturday, I had to find a hotel for the extra night.  The staff were very helpful and friendly and the whole hotel is very clean.  The little sitting room just off of the front desk is very charming.  I had a very early departure and they helped me by ordering a cab which was there right on time early the next morning.  The hotel is an easy walk to the Louvre and other places of interest.   The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating, and they even upgraded one of our rooms to a suite so that our family could stay on the same floor. Clean and comfortable, perfect location. We look forward to staying here again! This was my first trip to Paris and I stayed at the Hotel du Danube on recommendation from a friend who has stayed before. Beautiful hotel and in the PERFECT location! The staff was friendly and always had a smile on their faces. My room was comfortable and I felt safe 100% of the time! The hotel is walkable to a lot of major attractions. The neighborhood is cute and full of life, stores, cafes and restaurants. I will be staying here again on future visits to Paris!  For the last 10 years I've been staying at the Hotel de Danube and this trip was the best ever. Before we even checked in Marco, the manager, was of great help in tracking down my wife's missing luggage.  His support made a challenging job much easier in dealing with Air France. That proved to be a very positive sign for the balance of our 10 day stay.  The hotel has been renovated and our stay couldn't have been better in all respects.  Cleanliness, responsiveness and general support for any issue a traveler might have. The balance of the staff was also most helpful at any hour of the day.  I love the left bank and I love the location of this hotel-sandwiched between Boulevard St. Germain and the Seine you're an easy hop to anyplace you want to travel in Paris. As a person This hotel is a gem - as many before have commented, the location cannot be beat. You can easily walk to the Louvre or d'Orsay and many famous and not-so-famous bistros and cafes are steps away. We stayed in Room 15, which was the largest hotel room I've ever seen in Europe. The bathroom was a marble dream. Breakfast is served in a lovely courtyard garden. But what makes this hotel better than the others is the staff: Thomas, Jessica, Marco, and Alexander were professional but friendly, and really care that you are enjoying your time in Paris. Thanks to them for helping make our days in Paris truly memorable. This hotel is a gem. Perfectly located in the 6th. Comfortable, stylish and the staff is so accommodating and helpful. There is a lovely courtyard where breakfast is served. We met friends there and enjoyed wine and cheese. Staff helped us arrange. We will return. Great beds, pillows and AC. LOVE THIS HOTEL.  The location of this hotel was wonderful! We loved being in walking distance of multiple museums while not feeling like we were staying in a touristy area. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The only issue we had was that the shower didn't drain correctly, but that wouldn't stop us from booking this hotel again.  This gem in St. Germain de Pres was our home for 12 days.  We had a twin room overlooking Rue Jacob and a local cafe, but heard nothing at all at night. As the other reviews state, the staff is just lovely. We enjoyed breakfast on the patio in the early days when it was warm, and the charming breakfast room when it cooled down later in our stay. The location is superb and the decor is charming.  A wonderful value! My room was a deluxe twin room facing a lovely garden patio very quiet , bedding and pillows fluffy, a nice little bathroom and wc separated. Delicious breakfast . Located in the best place in Paris, because you can walk to museums,go to fabulous restaurants and have a real French feeling going to the coffee bistro next door ! I stay 6 days and plan to come back to this home from home . Ariane Raoul-Duval Pike Beautiful and whimsical, the staff are incredibly friendly and the location is great. You turn the corner and are about 5 minutes from the Louvre, and there are plenty of yummy restaurants nearby. The rooms are full of character and are very Parisian. My husband and I stayed for our first wedding anniversary and it definitely felt special. Thank you for a lovely stay! Upon arrival, the staff at the hotel were very friendly and accommodating. They stored our luggage until we returned later. Upon returning the luggage was already brought to our room.  Our room was very nice with a comfortable bed. It was larger than many others. We stayed in during this trip and even had to Juliet balconies. We loved this hotel.  The perfect location in Paris!  We also got a renovated suite which was amazing.. the bed was so comfortable and the staff so responsive.  For the cost and location would not stay anywhere else in Paris!  Boutique feel and great stay.. From our arrival at the hotel until the check out time the service at the hotel was perfect, from the hotel desk representatives to the cleaning staff. Our room was well appointed, quiet, comfortable, clean. There was a fridge, safe, assortment of teas. And the bathroom was top of the line, with heated towel rack and a great shower. But most importantly was the warmth and willingness to help of the people who work there. All of them were wonderful but I would especially like to thank Mikayel. The location of the hotel is so central that one can walk everywhere, museums, restaurants, shopping, or just wandering around the beautiful Left Bank, and there are always taxis around in case of the inclement weather. There are also a few grocery shops nearby. We will certainly stay there Such a lovely hotel in a perfect location. Friendly and kind staff, beautiful public spaces, and quiet, charming rooms. We felt so welcome. We especially enjoyed the excellent air conditioning during our heatwave stay with temps in the 90s. Breakfast in the courtyard made us feel like we were staying at a very special family home in Paris. Such a treat! The hotel is so conveniently located - close to great sights in every direction.   We had a very comfortable room with good bathroom and (most importantly) a great shower.   The staff are so delightful and helpful.    We’ll never stay anywhere else in Paris again.   Nice hotel in a great location. Friendly, helpful staff. Good breakfast (14€). Walkable distance to many sites. Nearby metro. En-suite bathrooms, comfortable beds. Though they have an elevator, some rooms require climbing some stairs so be sure to talk to them about mobility issues when you make your reservation. Front desk staff was extremely helpful and was always friendly and courteous. The location was perfect as you were close to all the sights yeti was very quiet and subdued given the bustling area of Paris  Very nice location, lovely staff, safe and comfortable hotel. We stayed for three nights and were able to walk everywhere including the Eiffel Tower, louvre museum (short 8 minute walk), notre dame, musée d’Orsay…  The friendliest and most conscientious staff in Paris - Jessica took great care of us during our stay. Our flight landed at 7 AM so we were very early to the hotel but she invited us to lounge in the lobby until our room was ready. Our room was small but clean, comfortable, and quiet overlooking the courtyard. It made a huge difference to be able to leave the hustle and bustle behind and take a nap in the middle of the day but still know that we were only a 10-20 minute walk from most of the sites we wanted to see. The location is fantastic. The breakfast offered everything we could have wanted. Just around the corner from the hotel, we enjoyed a special dinner at the Boutary and adored the Jardins de Luxembourg. We will return!  The hotel is in the perfect location within easy reach of all the tourist attractions. It was very comfortable, clean, well furnished and quiet. Lots of local restaurants to choose from. The staff could not have been more helpful. A very pleasant stay. We will definitely stay again next time we visit Paris. We just finished a family of three vacation in Paris. All of our first time in France. We spent our entire vacation, six nights at this wonderful boutique hotel. As you will see from other reviews the location is perfect for all the major sites, Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Museum de Orsay, Museum Invaldis, Notre Dame etc. Many major bus stops as well as metro stops in the vicinity. What sets this hotel apart from the others is not only the location but the wonderful staff. We were warmly greeted and given a very quick tour of the ground floor before entering the elevator for our room on the first floor. We had what seemed to be a very recently renovated and large ( for Paris) bathroom. The shower could easily have fit two. Very spacious, larger than ours at home. There was also a The hotel is located in the heart of St-Germain des Pres, walking distance to Le Louvre and Le Musee d'Orsay.  The neighborhood cafes and restaurants are  filled with college students and Parisian regulars.  The hotel staff was particularly friendly and helpful.  My husband and I felt as if we were part of their family.          We had a three day stay and loved every minute of it! The staff were extremely helpful and the location was perfect in relation to metro stations, restaurants, and all of the other amenities we could think of. Very accessible, comfortable rooms, and we plan on staying here again when we can!  We were recommended to stay here and we were happy we did.  Location is perfect for local restaurants, wonderful walks along the seine, louvre We had a family room for our family of 3. It was a comfortable base to return to for a quiet sleep every night.  Breakfasts are a treat with welcoming friendly staff serving a fresh continental buffet and scrumptious basket of pastries.  All staff are very helpful and friendly, offering to assist to make reservations etc. I hope to return for another stay.  Thank you Hotel Danube  A well located hotel, close to the main sites in Paris, pleasantly decorated with very friendly and helpful staff. It is family owned and a short walk from the metro station. Our room was small, but it contained all the necessary facilities. Would definitely return for another visit and warmly recommend it to others. Perfect location to walk most anywhere. Comfy beds and linens and friendly and helpful staff. Excellent breakfast and housekeeping. Stayed here for one week with my grand daughter and we were both extremely pleased. Highly recommend!!! Wonderful, cozy, charming hotel in an incredible location. The staff were all Lovely - very helpful with taxis and any questions we had. We will recommend to anyone going over and we will stay here again.  I like to book vacation rentals/Air B&B's, but after reading about so many that were misleading regarding Air conditioning, we went with a hotel. So glad we did.  Air conditioning was great, and the extra help from the staff was a bonus. Our friends visiting Paris the same time as us did get an air B&B and were melting.   The Hotel du Danube is a charming hotel in the sixth arr.  /the staff is very helpful and charming as well.  The location is very good and if you need help with cabs or restaurants the staff is right there to assist.  I would stay there again.  We stayed at Hotel du Danube for 3 nights after arriving in Paris from the US.  We had a great stay!  We reserved one of the hotel's larger rooms which was well worth it - very comfortable bed, nice sitting area, huge bathroom, and remarkably quiet (great for dealing with jet lag...).  The location is ideal as it is in the midst of all that St. Germain has to offer - shops, sights, restaurants (don't miss Les Deux Magots).  Plus it is easy walking distance to the Louvre, the Musee d'orsay, Notre Dame, and much more.  We will definitely be back. Great service and team were super helpful and accommodating. Very comfortable rooms, air conditioning and perfect location. Excellent restaurants and shops close by. Looking forward to our next visit.\"},\n",

This hotel is absolutely recommended. Everything is nice: the staff, the rooms, the bed, the pillows and the breakfast. And the best thing is that the room price is really cheap compared to other hotels in Paris. Recently, I had the pleasure of staying at the B55 Hotel in Paris 😊 and was extremely impressed with the exceptional service. The friendliness and kindness of the staff are truly remarkable, making our stay even more memorable 🌟. A special shoutout to Carina, who stood out with her attentive service and always with a smile on her face 😄. I will definitely return 🙌 and recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an amazing lodging experience in the City of Light! 🗼 I stayed at the Hotel for a week in August and my stay was exactly what I was hoping for: a boutique hotel in a safe and quiet location off the beaten track, modern, air-conditioned and clean room, excellent buffet breakfast and professional service.  Highly recommended! I have stayed in this hotel twice. Once after a business trip last November 2022, and then a couples trip with my partner in December. I am planning to stay there again next month, on the first week of September :).  I have booked this hotel directly on their website and their site is very user friendly and easy to use. The booking process is straight forward and hassle free. I have also signed up for their newsletter and they usually send me discount codes in certain periods to have the rooms slightly cheaper than public price. This was the case for my booking in December and will be the case for my trip next month. Anyway, the hotel is nicely situated in the 14th district of Paris, which is still a safe and calm district. It is also conveniently located near the Parc This hotel was superb. Location was wonderful, close to several restaurants and close to two metro stations. It was comfortable and elegant. The pool was perfect for our family of four and a lovely end to a long day of walking. We would stay again anytime! Excellent hotel stay. Nice and efficient staff. The hotel facilities are modern and excellently maintained. Great value for moneyץ I return to the hotel every time I visit Paris for both work and leisure The hotel itself is immaculate and the soundproofing in the rooms is amazing. We stayed with a four and six-year-old and a two-bed room and when we closed both bedroom doors, we could hardly hear a thing as they played. It was great to get a bit of peace in a busy city break.  The pool has a limit of four people and operates a booking system. It really adds a level of luxury to the stay  The reception staff are fantastic. Remembering the names of people in each room, the pool bookings we had made, pro actively letting us know when slots became available, cleaning the rooms while we swam and organising transport. Simple things, but it’s a nice touch not having to wait for someone to look you up on a computer every time you ask a question. You can just feel there is good Nice and new hotel, very friendly and useful staff, spacious rooms with comfortable beds, each equipped with an espresso machine and a wine fridge. The breakfast is also good. Very convenient to reach Paris School of Economics. I recommmend it! Very friendly staff and exceptionally high standard of service. The rooms are very clean and modern. Will definitely be staying here next time I travel to Paris, whether for business or pleasure. Rooms are fully air conditioned, which was definitely a benefit.  I was in Paris for academic meetings and stayed for the first time at Hotel B55. I definitely recommend this hotel to others who seek a location close to both the Left and Right Bank (a short trip on the RER B line) with excellent amenities.. We loved staying at hotel B55. I liked the location and the staff. The room was cozy and super clean. It was relaxing and quiet. I was close to the metro, restaurants and shopping without being in a noisy area. What really made the experience special was that the staff felt like they knew us personally and were very quick to meet any need. For example, each room came with a Nespresso machine, which is great. Any time we wanted more coffee they gave it to his at the front desk without a problem. I\\'m also a big tea drinker. They were kind enough to quickly provide us with an electric tea kettle for the week and pointed me to their great selection of teas in the breakfast area. My family will again be in Paris at the end of the month- and they\\'ll be staying at B55.  I\\'ll be Currently visiting this hotel frequently for professional reasons. Very friendly staff, quite hotel, located close to metro line 7, nicely renovated, well equiped rooms … absolute my favorite hotel when staying in Paris.  Kudos to the whole team! The hotel staff were all fantastic. Despite all our requests they were so kind and helpful. My team of 8 all stayed here and had a wonderful experience. The breakfast is also much nicer than advertised, including waffles, pancakes and freshly squeezed orange juice. In a convenient location.  I really enjoyed my stay at Hotel B55. The facilities were amazing and the bedroom was very spacious and tidy. One of the staff Jeremy was very accommodating and helpful with our stay. He went the extra mile to ensure everything was done to our liking. I highly recommend staying at this hotel. 10/10 experience! Really good hotel with super friendly staff. Nice breakfast area to also unwind in. Location isn’t bad at all especially if you don’t mind public transportation.  Bud is about a 2 minute walk and metro about 10 minutes. 24 hour mini mart just around the corner too. Safe area as well. I’d definitely book again. An excellent experience at this beautiful hotel. The staff are very friendly, in particular Maryam who was warm and welcoming on arrival, she allowed us to check in early and was very friendly throughout the whole stay - she was very accommodating and really helped make the whole process as easy as possible. As for the hotel, the facilities are excellent with free access to hot drinks and with it being a wine hotel, there is access to wine (through a pay as you go card) downstairs. We also paid the 35 euro for the spa facilities (per room per stay), which we would highly recommend - amazing facilities and very relaxing after a long day exploring Paris. The rooms were finished to a high standard and room service were excellent, refreshing the room each day, and also very clean. A clean and quiet environment, very friendly behavior and very kind staff like Ms. Maryam who was very responsible and with her pleasant voice and beautiful smile, gave a special peace to the hotel. I hope to return to Paris soon and stay in this hotel Amazing team, whether the caring and smiling persons at reception desk, or the truly efficient housekeeping team. All common areas (breakfast, spa and tiny outdoor garden in photos) are flooded with natural light and a minimal design, which is truly appreciable. Quite location with all basic amenities in rooms. This hotel is a real gem. The rooms are very comfortable, spacious enough and spotlessly clean.   I loved the bathroom - the shower was glorious, plenty of space to put everything, and nice lighting :)   Windows open (which is sometimes hard to find) onto a typical Parisan street. The area is away from the hustle and bustle of central Paris, but alive enough so you feel part of the city, and has enough local shops for you to grab some water/fruit/whatever to take back up to the room.  Glaciere metro is a 10 minute pleasant walk away, you can get to most places easily from there.   Staff are friendly and competent - I asked for a few things and I was responded to immediately and very satisfactorily. Housekeeping staff are great - big shout out to them.  The jewel in this crown Our experience with hotel B55 was great - the food, the room and especially the service of the staff in general and Julian the manager in specific - Julian has assisted us with the booking of many attractions and helped us a great deal with our trip planning. Very clean, great value, great area, a pool in downtown Paris!, staff that goes the extra mile, 8 wines on tap, etc.  We got the family room. 1 bedroom with a big bed connected to a bedroom with 2 smaller beds. Perfect for a family of 4.  I\\'ve been to Paris many times and this place takes the cake. Lots of great restaurants close by, yet not a loud party area.   Best value in Paris!!!!  I couldn\\'t recommend this hotel more.... Excellent hotel, great service.  Comfortable and very nice rooms, a good and very varied breakfast, the hotel has a pool and a sauna.  Close to park  Montsouris and to Cité internationale universitaire de Paris We stayed at this smashing hotel for four nights. Like all big cities  hotels in Paris can be a bit hit and miss but this exceeded all expectations. Our top floor room (703) was spacious, beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean. The bed is one of the best I\\'ve ever slept in and the excellent soundproofing meant our stay was very peaceful and undisturbed. The hotel is approximately 25 mins away from central Paris attractions by bus or Metro (the No 21  bus stops right outside and the City University Metro is 10 mins walk away through a beautiful park) The extra travel is absolutely worth the effort as I have yet to find a reasonably priced hotel of this quality in the centre. The hotels best assets are without doubt the staff. They are the loveliest I have ever encountered in Bare in mind Paris I’ve never been & didn’t know what to expect at all.  I found this hotel and booked it because it looked the best available with a pool.  And had two bedrooms which was ideal so our small children could be in a separate room, rather than squashed in our room with us.   Hotel staff excellent, polite English speaking and helpful.  The rooms are clean and nearly done fresh.  Swimming pool was something we’ve never had before which is time slot you book it and it’s only your group this private way we actually found good and made it more enjoyable in the pool as a family plus the pool room sets off a relaxing feeling.   The only downfall was parking was payment which now coming home and seeing how much and we was there for 4 nights - has added up too over £120GBP. We are just back from an excellent 7-night stay in this lovely hotel. The staff were fantastic from start to finish. When I was booking in mid-June they phoned with a solution to a block on my credit card. On arrival home, they quickly sorted out a misunderstanding re our Taxi price. Much appreciated. On arrival, they greeted us with patience as I attempted to try my little french. That evening they told us how to get to the nearest supermarkets and restaurants. A rain shower that night was not a problem- complimentary umbrellas. On our second day, we did a Free Walking Tour travelling on  Bus 21  (2 mins from B55 ) to Hotel De Ville.  This bus service proved invaluable to us as we travelled on it to the Latin Quarter (bus-stop \"St Michel -St Germain\") each night for dinner - Visited Paris during peak season with my mom and sister. Overall, the hotel is an excellent value. Ioved the location. Close enough to the city centre but away from the loud traffic and tourists. We had multiple restaurants and cafes right outside of our hotel, as well as a pharmacy and convenience store where we purchased water, snacks, and alcohol. I also discovered a beautiful park with a small lake within a short walk. Made for a great evening stroll for a crepe and a run in the morning. The neighborhood felt very safe. For a more active person, it’s perfectly situated about a half mile walk from the metro, but my 60-year old mother struggled with the walk. There is Uber service available and the hotel staff graciously called taxis for us.  The staff was wonderful. Eager to Really enjoyed our 4 night stay here. This hotel is a little different in the sense that there is no restaurant or bar. There is a dining area for breakfast which has a substantial continental offering, this area is also the snack area which is open 24 hours for you to order UberEats or a similar delivery franchise.  Help yourself coffee machine 24 hours that dispenses free espresso, latte, hot choc etc.  Id recommend not leaving breakfast to the last moment as they clear away the food pretty quickly.  Small swimming pool suitable for 2 & sauna that needs to be booked and costs €35 for the duration of your stay sets up the day nicely or conversely helps you wind down after a frantic Paris.  10 minute walk to Glacière metro & straight in to Paris.  Very helpful front desk staff, I booked this hotel because it offered a family room and my expectations were surpassed. The family room had actually had one room divided into two separate bedrooms and a very quaint bathroom. Plenty of space!The hotel is modern, yet cozy. Great amenities and even better customer service. Maryam and Antonie were very helpful and friendly. Even though the hotel is not at the city center, it’s a short uber drive away from everywhere. I definitely recommend it! We have been here for two nights so far, and so far we’ve been hit with two hidden charges. First, they take a Euro 200 deposit against any breakages or (rather unspecified) costs. Second, they charge Euro 35 for use of the pool, and then it turns out you have to book and it’s almost always fully booked at the time you want to use it. Yesterday the staff made me wait 45 minutes next to an empty pool because someone had, they claimed, booked already, and even though that person or persons had not turned up they wouldn’t bring my slot forward slightly. They also claimed that they had 15 minutes of cleaning time between slots but that clearly wasn’t true: there was no member of staff there either before or after my slot. I don’t like being lied to, and when I put it to them that Here at the moment for our honeymoon the room is clean, pretty and we love the swimming pool and sauna.  The staff are friendly and the balcony is great. About 20mins from the Eiffel Tower via car.  The hotel would have 5stars if the following was done:  -  do not disturb sign when on our room - people still seem to knock and disturb asking if they can clean the room. It’s really annoying especially on your honeymoon.  - meat keeps being added to our breakfast when we have said we don’t eat pork.  - considering I have advised this is food our honeymoon a nice touch would have been appreciated - even just a congratulations on arrival.  But other then that nice hotel - id stay again but probably just for a casual visit to Paris not for a celebration. I cannot say enough good things about this place. From the second you walk in the door, the staff is so friendly. Everything is just beautiful and so clean. The rooms- oh the rooms- are just lovely. Quiet, safe, spacious, comfortable beds and the windows open for a nice breeze and sounds of the city. The only thing better than the comfy beds and room is the breakfast- I would be in heaven if I could eat there every morning. My only regret is getting back every night too late to enjoy the wine they offer. Please stay here when visiting Paris. You will not be disappointed. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance (Pizza San Giovanni is right down the street and has to die for Italian). Thank you, B55, for making our stay in Paris wonderful. <3 The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood and very unassuming.  It is a 10 minute walk to the subway, though there is are a number of buses on the corner.  The staff could not be  more friendly, patient and accommodating.  The interior design is ultra-modern, high quality and chic.  The entire hotel is immaculate.  We had a Queen size bed in a Standard room, as requested.  The bed was The Best, as were the linens.  Amenities in the room and throughout the hotel were great.  The breakfast is fabulous!  Waffles, eggs, sausage, ham, soppressata, fresh squeezed orange juice, delicious coffee and cappuccino, dried fruits and nuts, granola, assorted jellies and preserves, yogurt, fresh baked chocolate and plain croissants, danish, and mini apple turnovers-yum!  A beautiful park is just two A wonderful hotel with amazing staff but the breakfast options left much to be desired. A constant rotation of scrambled eggs, mini sausages being your only hot options eventually started feeling like bording school. Everything else on the \"buffet\" was mediocre. I\\'ve never dreaded breakfast at any hotel but this was just becoming unbearable by day 4 and 5. This is the only shortfall at this hotel but sadly it\\'s a big one. They need to do something about their breakfast it\\'s a joke We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel B55. The service was excellent and Antony was outstanding & made our visit truly memorable. He was so helpful, provided recommendations on local restaurants and made our reservations. Anything we needed, he supplied. Also, the daily breakfast was a nice way to start your morning. The ladies who assisted during breakfast were very kind. The hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood (not far from several local shops, restaurants) and is relatively easy to get to central Paris (the Louvre, Eiffel, etc) via Uber or Metro/Bus.  Many thanks to our friends at Hotel B55!! It was a pleasure. We arrived a t 7:00  AM  following an overnight flight from New York. Although check-in time is 3:PM, the desk clerk found us an available room and allowed us to check in early. (The availability of  short nap was appreciated) The hotel is located south of the heart of Paris and is a 10 minute walk from the nearest subway station.  The hotel is modern, the rooms are comfortable and the staff is extremely accommodating.  Free breakfast is included and, for me, the highlight was fresh squeezed orange juice. As with many other hotels, the rooms have no drawers for clothing.  The hotel has an indoor pool and bathrobes re provided in room.  If the 10 minute walk to the train doesn\\'t phase you, I highly recommend this hotel. This hotel far exceeded my expectations. Location is near train/metro/bus stations and just a short walk to the parc de Mountsouris parkrun. Easy to commute in and out of central Paris. Rooms were very comfortable, with beautiful bathrooms. The Swimming pool and Sauna were small .....but still luxurious. Will definitely stay here on next trip to Paris. Just got back from staying at Hotel B55 for 4 days. It’s super clean and the staff is very helpful. Breakfast is excellent. Loved the malt waffles and the fresh squeezed OJ. Really great. Pool is small but lovely. Bus stop very close by. Bus 21 goes right into central Paris. Metro stop is about 10 min walk. We bought the Mobilis tickets that were good for bus or metro unlimited use for one day. Used it on funicular at Sacre Coeur. Mobilis tix can only be purchased at the machine in metro station. You can buy bus tix at tobacco shop or on the bus but they’ll be only for one use and only good for just the bus. Loved the crepe restaurant, Les Docks, nearby. Definitely recommend that. Also the Circus Restaurant (15 min walk) was the only restaurant serving food around 4pm the day we This hotel appears to be very new. The high-tech, eco-friendly ambience worked well. Breakfast was very full by French standards. The staff, especially a very kind night manager, was very helpful (we needed an early breakfast on our travel morning). He pointed out two very good local restaurants. We were unfamiliar with this neighborhood (near Cité Université and not far from Montparnasse), but it was surprisingly quiet and the Metro was a short walk away. Our only concern was that the floor of the shower was very slick and falling was a constant concern (the reason for a downgrade from 5). We reported it to management and I hope they can address it. Otherwise, this accessible hotel met and exceeded our needs. Our 3 nights were not enough in this gorgeous little hotel. Nestled in a lively but lovely area towards the edge of the inner ring road of Paris, it has various easy transport links, a small but good choice of local food/drink options, really close to a small park and small but clean and tidy facilities in the hotel.  The rooms are spacious and beautiful with huge beds and smart TVs, with windows opening out onto the street below which for this close to the city centre is pretty quiet all night. The front desk staff are great, they can\\'t do enough to make you feel welcome and help with advice on getting around Paris.  I\\'d advise picking up a 1/2/3 etc day travel pass from the local metro station (10 mins walk), they allow travel on Metro, Bus and RER overground (we got zones'},\n",

Thankyou, can\\'t wait to get back to Paris! Very nice and central hotel with amazing staff, who helped and got everything we needed. Walking distances to most attractions and also a metro station right outside. Great size of the room, we stayed in a room with a balcony. Great shower as well. Never stay in Paris until they change the payment system. Now over a week since we stayed and still we haven’t been refunded our pre stay deposit of £341 ! Never stay in Paris. Reported the broken fridge to receptionist but nothing done about it Fantastic hotel in a great location. We can walk to everything and easy spot to get an Uber if we can’t. Friendly helpful staff. Good buffet breakfast downstairs and restaurant attached. Comfy bed and quant verandah.  Location is perfect, staff is awesome. We didn\\'t try any hotel amenities but the €14 breakfast was great. Room was very cool-looking, under the rooftop with apparent wood beams. Shape was a bit quirky, and the hotel lost its 5th star due to very cold temperature (heat switches off after 3h to save energy, but unfortunately, winter cold doesn\\'t) and very few and hard-to-reach electrical outlets. Bathroom lacks a couple of basic things like places to hang wet towels and a little bench (basically, it is a €100 trip to Ikea from being perfect). Still, a really good hotel and very good value.  The recepcionist and Hotel workers were very kind. We were given an excellent treatment, especially from Emma. The hotel’s location is very good and rooms are very quiet. We’ll be back for sure! We totally recommend the Hotel Europe Saint Severin. From Emma at the front desk, to the location, to the uniqueness of the rooms, our stay was awesome!  We felt welcomed as soon as we stepped in the door.  The location offered many options for coffee, pastries and dinner within walking distance.  Easy access to the metro and RER and Christmas markets galore!   second time staying at Hotel Europe Saint Severin. Great location with literally one minute metro and RER both A and B access. Very convenient to get from and to CDG.  If you want to be in St Michel and St Germain area, and also a bridge cross of 10 minute walk to  Arr 1, this is the place to stay. Rooms are cozy and clean, reception staf very friendly and helpful We just came back from our first trip to Paris and I would like to leave a review for our hotel, as it was a fantastic stay.  Due to the many many hotels around the area, it\\'s not easy to choose, so I hope our review helps with this. :)  Before arriving, the communications with the hotel management were fantastic. Mr Farouk, whom we didn\\'t meet I think, was quite helpful, and the hotel sent us several emails reminding us of dates and offering suggestions for things to do in Paris.   Our request of a lower floor room (recovering from a knee operation) was promptly assured with a walk in shower that I truly appreciated!   Room 117 was lovely. It has a little balcony looking at the street, we found it cosy! If you\\'re a light sleeper, bring a mask and earplugs - you could hear the Excellent location, close to points of interest, public transport and with many options to eat in the area. Even when is situated in a crowded area, the hotel is calm, silent and cozy. The attention was very good.  Our stay was perfect, with a very warm welcome and service that always listens to the customer. Highly recommend ! If you\\'re looking for a place where you\\'ll be warmly welcomed during your stay in Paris, and conveniently located, don\\'t hesitate, this is the place to be!  It was a perfect stay in this nice hotel in the center. The hotel is located in a very old and historical building. I was lucky to catch a room directly in the corner. So also the view outside was perfct. The corridors are winding and the ceilings are low. But this gives the hotel a special flair. The rooms are also labyrinthine and not particularly large. But they don\\'t have to be. Unfortunately, there was no window to the outside in the bathroom. That is perhaps the only point of criticism. But that\\'s not always possible in such an old building.  I felt very comfortable there.  Also the breakfast was good.  clean, great decoration (christmas) in the lobby, spacious room, nice staff! - very helpful, Notre Dame is just a sone\\'s throw away, Metro about 2 min away (runs every three minutes) We look forward to our next visit :-) Hotel was small but comfortable clean and quiet. Requested a quiet room and was given a room which opened out to the inner courtyard. Stayed 5 nights solo trip and felt safe. Awesome location, restaurants everywhere, 5 mins to river & Metro, close to Luxembourg Gardens and Notre Dome. Easy walk to Museum D’Orsey and Lourve.  Breakfast was good. Rooms small which is normal for Paris but bathroom tiny - left door open - had to squeeze between wall and basin to get into the shower. If someone was obese they would have to request another room. However reception staff inattentive with no interest in helping to the point of being rude and in the wrong job. Asked for best shopping street in Le Marias and was told no shopping there and directed to Westfield. Found out on my 5th and Very clean, and quiet( didn’t hear much street noise) . It was in a very safe part of town and lots of shops and restaurants / cafes around. Metro was very close , people were very friendly and the desk. Breakfast was good- (but always had cold scrambled eggs) Would definitely recommend!!  Note to the management of this hotel:  Both of the reception men we encountered at this hotel is very unwelcoming and rude.  Almost like we’re an inconvenience and begging them for a room instead of us paying them over 1k for 3 rooms a  night.  One of them even openly accused us of sneaking a person into our room when he had his own separate room at the hotel and asked why we have five people in a 4 person occupied room.  The steps of  this hotel are very unevenly unsafe and  the elevator does not feel safe and is unevenly with the ground.  if  you stay at the suit on the 6th floor you have to maneuver their puzzle of hallways and up 2 plights of stairs with your heavy suitcases (they should mention this on their website).  3 stars is for the very nice lady at the breakfast Location good. Many restaurants surrounding. Hotel clean and stylish. But the staff discriminated Asian. Especially the black hair French lady. Keeping using French to gossip you with her colleagues and just showed you how they don’t like you. That’s pretty bad experience Good location, transportation nearby and restaurants too. Room are small but comfortable, the sound proofing are not too good, also it seems to me that the house keeper was in a hurry to finish her cleaning and forgot to supply the coffee bag in few occasions  I highly recommend this hotel for anyone traveling to Paris - you\\'re surrounded by so many late-night and authentic food options and are nestled within walking distance of all of Paris best attractions such as the Siene River, Notre Dame, Lourve and d\\'Orsay Museum.  The restaurant also has great food options - offering dinner and breakfast for hotel guests via the cafe next dor (who had amazingly friendly staff). The front desk staff at the hotel were also helpful and welcoming and made us feel right at home.  I\\'ll definitely be staying here if I\\'m ever in Paris again! The price is affordable, they have all your basic needs and the location is unbeatable! Fantastic property with lovely clean rooms, has a lift and a good sized lift at that! We didnt have breakfast or dine at property as to many options around to choose from. Fantastic location and lovely staff. Good value for money in my opinion Hotel Severin was amazing.  The minute you walk in the staff made you feel welcome.  Located on the left bank in the Latin Quarter 5 minutes to Notre Damm and easily accessible by  metro to other areas.    European size rooms were perfect and exactly what you want for a boutique hotel in Paris.  My room had french doors that opened to balcony with cute chairs.  With a slight breeze blowing curtains I felt like I should be wearing a beret.    I would come back to Paris to stay in this hotel.  All I can say is \"it was amazing\". We enjoyed this hotel- very friendly staff and quiet, cozy room. The room was small (as expected with most places in Paris), but clean, modern, and comfortable. The location is convenient and walkable to most areas. Would stay here again! The hotel was located in a very nice area with many restaurants and good transportation nearby.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful.  The room was very clean and comfortable.  The bathroom was adequate. Super hotel with character and charm. Clean. Room spacious. Location is fantastic for bars and restaurants. Notre Dame and metro station 1 minute away to link anywhere, Stade de France. Airport, rest of city. This hotel ranks as one of the coolest I\\'ve ever been in, in terms of unique looks, comfort and location. The location is pretty much perfect, being in the heart of the cafe and restaurant section of the Latin quarter, but outside the mass tourist streets. It is also a short walk from the easy subway trip from CDG airport. The room itself with its high stone and wood ceilings, elegant but warm look, bathtub in one end of the main room, and comfortable bed, was superb. And the breakfast was tasty, more varied than most, and was held in a small charming restaurant in the hotel ground floor.  I\\'ve stayed in hundreds of hotels so far, and this one ranks as one of the best and most interesting. But it comes at a price. It\\'s expensive. On the other hand, if you\\'re going to be in This hotel is in the heart of the Latin Quarter, which I highly recommend. We walked around on a Tuesday night at 10 pm and the streets were packed with young adults. The atmosphere was great. It is also walking distance to some good restaurant. The Hotel staff was amazing and accommodating.  We had a room with a balcony and it was awesome to look out on the street and have a glass of wine!  The location of the hotel was in the heart of the Latin quarter and close to everything.  I would highly recommend staying! This hotel is within easy walking distance of Notre Dame, St Chapelle, Ile St Louis and all of the left bank churches and cafes. We had a really nice, spacious room with a balcony. Room was very clean. The staff was incredibly helpful and pleasant. This hotel was a great choice. Excelent atention and predisposition from the WHOLE staff. Perfect cleaning. Great location. Good AC. Even. The rooms ate quite small is ok for a bot bery very long stay. We would come nack when in Paris agaun. THANKS  Boutique hotel in an excellent location. The area is lively with many restaurants, cafes and shops. Notre Dame, The Seine and The Louvre are within walking distance. Metro station and stops for hop-on/hop-off buses were around the corner.  Concierge Emma was outstanding - made our stay so memorable - she was friendly, informative and went out of her way to make suggestions and book our anniversary dinner cruise. Can’t say the same for all the front desk personnel (polite but not as helpful)  but her professionalism and dedication made up for the others.  Rooms were small but comfortable - bed was comfortable, bathroom was updated and there is a mini fridge in the room - balcony room was great. Would definitely recommend this hotel.  The location is fantastic, my specific room was small but clean ,good for one person. Two person would be problematic (unless a passionate brand new couple). The service and the desk are perfect and very kind and very helpful. Maybe some old (yet romantic) furniture should be renovated. Great shower. I would certainly return (alone).   Lovely hotel within walking distance in the Latin Quarter. The hotel was very well kept and the staff friendly. There are many cafes, shops, and useful stores in the area. We enjoyed our visit to Paris partly because of the hotel we had to return to at the end of the day. The shower was broken and poured water into the bathroom, which was the main issue with the room. The beds were a little stiff and the room was a little hot but we couldn’t figure out the AC. The rooms were tidy but much smaller than the photos. The staff were incredible helpful and very accommodating. Would probably find somewhere a little cheaper. Love the location, room comfort and cleanliness, staff friendliness, and atmosphere. Quaint rooms - especially the ones with little balconies. Right near the St. Michel metro, near Notre Dame, St. Germain de Pres, Ile St. Loius, Luxembourg Gardens, the Marais and the Louvre.  Would recommend this hotel for anyone who wants to be in the hustle and bustle of Paris. Close to so many restaurants, bars, metros and landmarks. Hotel is clean, friendly and checks all the boxes. Understand there are different room choices so be sure your ok with a smaller room if you want to save money. There are many choices if you want a larger room also.  My friends and I found this place on line and were hoping it was going to be an acceptable place in a nice neighborhood.  We couldn\\'t have picked a better spot.  Notre Dame is an easy 5 minute walk (if that) and there is a Metro Station 2 minutes walk from the hotel.  From CDG we were able to take the RER B train straight to the St Severin Notre Dame stop, about a 25 minuted train ride.  In short the location could not have been better.  My room (with a balcony) was roomy for Paris standards but still a bit small.  Great places close by to grab a beer and a meal and people watch.  Also, the staff was very pleasant and helpful.  If I ever return to Paris this is where I will be staying. We loved our time here, the walkability, the location, the amount of all different kinds of foods close by - it’s a great place to stay!  It is a historic building so some of the comforts you may be used to won’t be present (like AC) but windows open for airflow, and you can watch the action in the street below.  The nightlife in the area is also always on, so keep in mind if you’re a light sleeper.  Location is very good. Quiet and air conditioned rooms, a bit small. Very kind, nice and helpful staff. Breakfast is excellent the food is very fresh and service very kind. I wish to be able to get more accurate information and recommendation from the staff about the new happenings going on in Paris. Very small but comfortable. Took a bit to get our room though. Great location. I\\'d stay again the next time for location.  Our room had s cute balcony buy we weren\\'t there long enough to enjoy it. Good hotel Perfect location, excellent accomodations. A aimé  · Location was unbeatable. Breakfast was outstanding. Everything else great. The whole hotel was Immaculately clean and the bed was incredibly comfy.'},\n",

We’ve stayed at many hotels Citadines for is located in a great place, close to the Eiffel Tower, Paris Military School, shops, restaurant, and accessible public transportation. The lobby was small but cozy, the decor was pretty modern, it was pretty clean, and the more importantly the front desk agents were really helpful and kind, one of them was fluent in 3 languages. The rooms were really a one bedroom apartment, with a full sizr kitchen, and living room. The living had a pullout bed, which was comfortable, with a closet full of sheets and pillows. The view of our apartment was great, from the kitchen we can see the top of the Eiffel Tower, and the neighborhood below.  There is a small courtyard in the rear of the hotel, in case you want to enjoy a cup of coffee outside. For the hotel really thrives We absolutely loved this hotel! The staff was so friendly, kind and accommodating. We arrived early (8am) and check in isn\\'t until 4 but they made sure to call us as soon as a room was ready. The hotel was very clean and in a great location. We had the eiffel tower view from balcony and the view was incredible! We can\\'t wait to stay here again! Highly recommend!  This place was exactly what I needed for my long stay in Paris. Very convenient and has a subway station across the streets that can take you everywhere in Paris. There is a farmer\\'s market that is held twice a week in that area, a big PRIX(The French version of TARGET) in the corner of the left block. In addition, a bunch of businesses on the right street like bakeries, clothing stores and restaurants. My room was very comfortable and big. The staff is amazing and very attentive to all my requests. I have to mention Ness was my favorite person at the front desk, she gave me some extra tips on places where I should go! I definitely would book my next trip to Paris in this hotel again. Dissapointed . Tower Eiffel was not as i excpected. All around tower was surrownded by glass and the park in front if the tower was very dry,dirty ,no grass,no floweres as they show in the pictures.  All around were comstructions. Very disappointed. To shame, bevause Paris is magnifique a I had a lovely one-month stay here this summer. Staff are always kind, attentive, and helpful. The rooms are spacious and clean, but what I loved most was the well-stocked kitchenette which included dishes, pots, pans, silverware, and everything you could need in a kitchen! The location is great, just a few steps away from the metro and surrounded by cafes, shops, and restaurants.  In general, this hotel gets the job done. It\\'s not the best for staycations but it\\'s good enough if you\\'re just spending most of the day touring. The rooms were spacious and had a nice peek at the Eiffel Tower. I encountered some hiccups though like a broken bathtub drain and bath towels not being replaced. Our room was facing the train station but we didn\\'t find the noise bothersome at all as the others who have reviewed about it.   The location was very convenient. It\\'s right beside a train station that connects you to the rest of Paris, and there are a lot of restaurants and stores nearby.  This is a great place to stay. The staff are all really kind and helpful. The rooms are so nice and very clean. I loved being able to use the kitchenette. The views are amazing. You can see the Eiffel Tower from some rooms, but the view over the back garden is also really pretty, especially the sky over the roofs of the neighboring buildings. The location is super convenient. There is a metro station right across the street, the Eiffel Tower is a 15 minute walk away, and there is a market across the street twice a week with fantastic produce. Plus, there are a ton of great cafes and bakeries on both streets next to the hotel. The basement has a washing machine and clothes dryer, plus the bathroom has a towel warmer and clothesline, which makes doing laundry very easy. I thoroughly enjoyed my one-month stay in this establishment between late June to mid-July. The hotel is conveniently situated near a metro station and within viewing/walking distance of the Eiffel Tower. As for the room, the kitchenette was fully equipped with additional appliances (a tea kettle and espresso machine), and the sleeping accommodations were comfortable and cool (with AC). The hotel staff were always professional, friendly, and courteous. Also, great outdoor patio and garden to lounge!  I know this is a harsh review. However, you stay in a hotel for a good night sleep.  This hotel sits right above the subway. Even earplugs failed to assist me sleep. In the end I took a pill. I did get some sleep but by 6am there was a train every 2 minutes.  I checked out feeling stressed.  I\\'ve stayed in Paris a dozen times, and whilst the Eiffel Tower is near, I feel there are much nicer areas. The Latin quarter is probably  a fav.   I\\'m sorry, but this hotel really didn\\'t have anything to offer, even the view of the tower was around the corner, nearly needing to stick my neck out the window.   This property is an Affordable hotel apartment in Paris city center close to Eiffel Tower. We got the room with Eiffel Tower view, our view was the top half of the tower. It was a bit expensive but we were in Paris and wanted this view, also it was one of the reasonable priced for an Eiffel Tower view. We have stayed with Citadines before in Brussels so we know what to expect. Rooms are not luxurious but was cozy, comfortable and spacious enough for our family of 4 with 2 boys. We have a living room area and kitchen with complete supplies you need if you want to cook and eat at the hotel to save a little. The hotel is a few steps away from La Motte Picquet Metro station, there is also a McDonald’s on the same building and a supermarket across the street. There’s free coffee and This hotel is ideal. First, if this is something that concerns you, the hotel is 100% wheelchair accessible, but you need to call the front desk before arrival to make sure an accessible unit is booked for you. Location is perfect because it is within a walking distance to the tower and all the souvenir shops and the downtown tourist places, the staff is very helpful welcoming and caring, and the best of all is the rooms are spotless clean and spacious and have everything you need; refrigerator, microwave, stove, dishwasher, utensils, everything even cleaning supplies. You would not need a thing. The only thing I did not like is the check in time, it is 15:00 which I think is too late for tourists. i was trying to find a place for sat night...the date was wrong and when i realized i made a mistake i immediately canceled...they charged me any way!!  You got my money this time..never again!  I contacted them immediately and they refused to help me.  shame on them The only positive points for staying at the Citadines Eiffel Tower is it’s location (convenient metro just in front) and spacious rooms for Parisian standards.  However, there was too much noise we could hear footsteps from neighboring rooms, from the metro and construction. VERY poor customer service: at check in empty shower gels and when asked to refill it wasn’t done. Uncomfortable beds and pillows… and to top it all terrible attitude from the receptionist …. That just sealed our opinion for never coming back to this hotel! VERY important to note that unlock all other hotels housekeeping is at an extra charge and has to be pre booked 24 hours in advance !! We’ve been to other apartment hotels and never had this sort of service! Liked: The location is excellent, just opposite the Metro Station. It\\'s just about 10mins walk away from Eiffel Tower. The noise from the trains passing by was very mild and tolerable. Didn\\'t disturb us particularly. The room floor was also very clean. Our room was on the 5th floor. They have 7 floors but the 7th floor is for studio rooms. We booked an apartment room (with Eiffel Tower view) as we had 4 pax (2 adults and 2 children). Wifi was great and stable. Kitchen had a stove, kitchen utensils and microwave. We were greeted by Asian-looking gentleman during check-in. We didn\\'t get his name but he went out of his way to explain regarding the amenities available. He also helped us to call a restaurant for reservation although the restaurant was fully booked. There\\'s a lovely This hotel has amazing views of the Eiffel Tower, but the service was terrible.  Housekeeping never showed up to clean our rooms.  Much worse, the staff double-charged us.  Imagine noticing your credit card has an extra mistaken $1,700 charge for two rooms.  The staff refunded the second mistaken charge a couple days later - at a worse exchange rate, causing us to lose $50 or so for their error.  Now they refuse to respond to fix this situation.  I would not recommend this hotel. This hotel was everything it said it’d be. It felt like a cute little European apartment. Large room/shower! I opted for the room with a view & it looked just like the pictures. It is right across from the metro, so that’s where the noise would come from. Free coffee & water in the lobby. Definitely would recommend :) Perfect place if you want central location to discover Paris on foot. Easy tube access from airport and located in fantastic location. Staff is also very helpful and always ready to recommend good place to eat. Rooms have all you need and are clean, breakfast is typical of French hotels. We arrived at the Hotel at 10am, check in was supposed to start from 3pm. \\'Nes\\' (I hope I got her name right) saw us from the counter and offered us early check in, free of charge.   My friends and I booked 2 rooms from this Aparthotel for 3 nights. Both rooms were clean and spacious, with great view of the Eiffel Tower too (around half). Do take note that you have to select the right room type when booking tho, some room types do not face the Eiffel Tower. The room has cooking utensils, water heater works great, even the tap has hot water (and I really mean hot water). The only tiny drawback about this hotel is the lack of slippers.    Thermostat works well for my room, with options to cooling and heating the room. The rooms can get pretty dry during the night. Some rooms came We booked this hotel very last minute when our plans changed and we rerouted to spend a couple of nights in Paris. The hotel itself is better suited for longer stays and is more equivalent to an American extended-stay with a kitchenette. We didn\\'t use the appliances and really just needed a place to sleep and somewhere to use as a launching point for some sightseeing. It is well-within walking distance to major attractions. There is a fabulous Thai restaurant within the block and we actually went there both nights, it was that good. Although convenient, the biggest complaint is the noise from the next door subway station. A train came rumbling through every couple of minutes and my white noise app couldn\\'t mask it at night. Overall a decent stay for our needs, but probably would This hotel was in a perfect area. Thw rooms are small, so dont expect American style rooms. But we only slept there and showered. So it was perfect. Coffee is provided in the lobby. They offer breakfast for a small cost. We didn\\'t try it. My husband got the room with the view of the Effiel Tower. Couldn\\'t have been a better choice. The hotel was about a 5 min scooter ride to the tower as well. McDonald\\'s is not the same in france, so I wouldn\\'t recommend going to the one by the hotel. The bakery was excellent as well as the other restaurants around. I can\\'t wait to go back!  We stayed in serviced apartments managed by Ascott group throughout Asia and their services have alawys been good. However, we can’t say the same for Citadines Tour Eiffel Paris.   Check in - Process was transactional. Asked for our passport and payment then gave us the room keycard. Different from other Ascott group check in which will provide local info.   Room - We received a pre check-in page for us to put in our request. We requested for a quiet room and what we got was probably the noisiest room… facing the metro track and traffic. The room floor was also dirty (I wore white socks and my socks were dirty after walking around the room) and we found plastic lying on the floor from previous guests.   Housekeeping & towel change - We were informed about there is no We have stayed here on every Paris visit for the last decade or more. Previously, we had found the staff charming and very friendly. This time they were merely efficient. When we rent in an apartment hotel, which this pretends to be, we plan to do some of our own cooking, especially in France where there is so much good food available and in this case a market steps from the front door on Wednesdays and Sundays. These units are so poorly equipped that this is virtually impossible. Even then, there were shortages of what was supposed to be available. One teaspoon for two people? One coffee mug for two people? Two small glasses, which is less than you usually get in an ordinary hotel room. The studio rooms are adequate and well insulated for sound, even those at the front a few Pictures definitely don’t tell the whole story here.     The staff was great and friendly. The view of the tower was also spectacular. But….    Once you look down, the metro station is right there. It’s like a scene out of Rocky 1. The train goes by all night, so if you don’t have enough drinks to knock you out, it will keep you up all night.     The mattress was so broken down, it was only half the depth that it should be, not to mention the spring in my back all night long. The mold in the bathroom was disgusting. There is no ventilation or fans to keep it from growing.     Bed never gets made or new towels (towels were like a 1 ply toilet paper). No coffee maker in the room, have to bring your cups from the room down to the lobby to get your coffee.     We were scared to try Arrived at hotel and walked into acceptable lobby. Checking in was told there was no room cleaning, even we were staying several days. You can get new towels, also toilet paper, by coming down to the lobby. Then when we got to our room, what a shock, nothing like the pictures they have on there web site. The place really needed an update, old everything, no pictures on the walls. No closet to hang your clothes. No place to put your suitcase accept at the bottom of your bed. Bathroom dirty, towels so thin you could see through them. We had a beautiful view of the above ground tram railway. Not worth the money. By the way, I loved Paris and will come back but won’t make this mistake again. We booked the hotel only for one night after coming from Disneyland as we had a day before heading back. Really convenient location and we booked the room with the eiffel tower view a bit pricey but I guess it\\'s worth it also we had the family room so was very spacious and had a microwave , fridge,dish washer, pots,and pans almost like a home away from home. The metro is literally at the door step and there is a direct train to Arc de triumph and the eiffel tower is walking distance.  Now the metro being so cloase also has its disadvantages. You will hear the metro passing by and also feel the vibration. Its was not a game changer for me however was a lottle annoying at the beginning but grew on us a few hours later. Plenty of food options with McDonald\\'s literally the next Stayed 4 nights at a one bedroom apartment, kids  slept on the sofa bed, no issue at all. Apartment was clean had a full kitchen even though small but it worked out good for us.  Our room had the Eiffel tower view on the 6th floor, you can see the lights at night. So beautiful. Even though it was in front of the metro line, we weren\\'t too bothered about the noise as some reviews mentioned.   On sunday morning there was a local market, we spent some time there buying artisan croissants..very delicious.  Also there is McDonald\\'s right besode the hotel, and Monprix supermarket across the street, very convenient for families. We also had breakfast at a local cafe across the road, I forgot the name but I recommend the green cafe as it was cheaper than the other ones, and the This hotel was perfect for two couples. The configuration of the rooms is such that both couples will have privacy, although one of the couples will be sleeping on a sofa bed. The mini kitchen in the apartment has everything you could possibly need, and the bathrooms are configured so that the toilet is in a separate room from the sink and shower, also allowing for a bit more privacy if more than one couple is sharing an apartment. There is complimentary water and coffee available in the lobby. The only reasons I am giving this hotel an average rating is due to room cleanliness/repair issues (there was blood spattered all over a curtain in the room, and one of the bathroom doors would not close properly due to the fact that it had obviously been bashed in at some point) and the the location is very good you have everything next to the hotel ! walk distance to the Eiffel Tower to make a jogging in the morning. next to Champs Elysees by walk  when I check in at 22:00 the receptionist was not nice he didn\\'t say hello directly give me to sign the form and tell me how much I need to paid! As director of the reception where I live, it was not a good reception (and it has nothing to do if I check in at 12:00 or 10:00 p.m.) and I was really very disappointed! He did not explain to me for breakfast (despite that it was not included in my reservation but if I wanted to take it?) and that there is a coffee machine for hotel guests, if there is one passwords for wifi ect.....all i need to have Even during my stay of 1 week the receptionists were not so helpful This hotel was recommended by our Travel Advisor for our first trip to Paris and did not disappoint.  The location is  wonderful and it is a very easy walk up to the Eiffel Tower.  The front desk staff was very helpful and kind with suggestions and directions especially Valentina!    The rooms are a great size and having the apartment style set up is wonderful.  We had an amazing view from our rooms and could not have asked for more to make our little home away from home feel great while we were there! This was a \"big birthday\" trip for 3 senior friends.  We stayed 7 nights and found the hotel very safe and convenient.  Our apartment (312) had a view of the Eiffel Tower and was a good layout with K bdr and a split pull-out sofa in living area, plus table/4 chairs, mini-kitchen and split bath.  It was small, but larger than we expected given typical European hotel room sizes.  We didn\\'t eat at the hotel; bought pastries/yogurt/berries/cheeses/wine nearby.  The metro was just across the street, so perfect for convenience; some noise but didn\\'t bother us at night.  Many cafes, small shops, plus a yummy bakery nearby.  The staff was very helpful, especially Valentina who did our check-in and continued to help us throughout with metro assistance, suggestions, etc always with a Daily cleaning not available , clear own garbage , breakfast is a bit overpriced , reception staff is very helpful .  We stayed for 3 nights - it was decent , supermarket next door , MC Donalds , sushi , next door , diagonally opp restaurant awesome food , very good location …… we walked to Eiffel Tower 15/20 mins max . We were at the hotel for 5 nights and it was a great location to be at! With 2 kids, there was enough room and it was a spacious apartment. Loved going to the nearby cafes, walked to Eiffel Tower in the evening, and strolled around at the bakeries, everything was within walking distance and I highly recommend the place! It was very clean and safe! Unfortunately not the best of stays at Citadines and quite upset. We arrived at the hotel around 11am to check our bags in and pay the full amount, we then returned at 4pm to check into our room. We were told to take a seat and waited nearly half an hour without being told anything except \\'someone is checking it\\', but it was very obvious the room was not cleaned as the women can down with a cloth and spray to tell them its okay! We received free breakfast the next morning as an apology what helped but I preferred if they were more honest about the room not being ready.  When we got to our room we impressed by the view, but unfortunately that quickly changed when we realized we were right next to a metro station. This was quite loud every night and extremely disappointing for the After paying in full at check in I was told the room would be ready “in 20 minutes”. Rather than standing in a cramped reception we went across the road for a coffee (husband and 2 small Kids). On our return we were given our keys.. go to our 1 bed apartment to find dirty towels on floor of bathroom and a suitcase and food wrappers in bedroom !!! We go back to reception and complete chaos. No one knew what was going on or who was in our room. 4 ladies in reception making many phone calls and looking intently at computers and refusing to give me any information, apologies or assurances. My 2 children extremely tired and becoming increasingly upset. After 2 hours from (from start of check in) manager finally appears and confirms no hotel room available for us. I had to frantically This place has become our home in Paris. We know the area very well as we lived around for some time, and staying here allows us to reconnect with our old area. The front desk staff is amazing, and the property is very well kept. We had another Eiffel Tower view studio, and waking up to that spectacular view was amazing. The studio was very spacious and had all the basics. The hotel is well connected by Metro and Bus and you can get anywhere very quick. Overall a recommended place to stay. I want to start by saying , it’s this was one of the best vacations ever for me and my little one and the hospitality of the hotel staff just made it so much better!  We arrived in Paris extremely early and they were so accommodating, on top of that the ladies and gentlemen who work the front desk are so pleasant and nice! There is one girl that stood out , i didn’t get her name but she has black hair , she made my daughter feel so special and she even volunteered to be our photographer when she saw me struggling to get a good picture! I will definitely return to Paris and this will be where  I stay.   Other major points for the hotel - it’s not really a hotel but apartments like which have more room.  Also location is a blessing, there are so many shops ,McDonald, pharmacies What a fantastic stay, and great value for money from a very caring and professional team. Amazing views from a good-sized room, bright and spacious with full amenities like a small studio with kitchenette, TV, wifi, safe etc... was a real delight. The hotel is super well situated in the midst of town, with convenient shopping, great restaurants and the metro, surprisingly quiet, right at your door. A traveller\\'s dream!!! Bravo and thank you everyone. Wow, wow, wow, just come back from a weekend trip to Paris, I LOVED this hotel, the bed was so comfy, the room was super clean, we had so many amenities like a kitchen area, tv, wifi, safe etc. We had the best room in the hotel by far, it was absolutely perfect, my highlight was watching the Eiffel Tower lights from lying in bed! I can’t thank the staff enough for giving us that room, the staff were so polite and helpful, such an amazing hotel! Had a Eiffel tower balcony view room and the view did not disappoint was absolutely amazing and so nice to see everyone from the room or balcony. Staff at reception were nice and was no problem in checking out 1 hour later for free. Very clean hotel. '},\n",

Staff were very friendly and accommodating, Dinner and breakfast in the restaurant were excellent, high quality and well priced for the area. Hotel is central to most attractions, and there is a metro station at the end of the street.  Highly recommend and will return when in Paris next. We stayed two nights at the Hotel. Checking in was easy, in fact we got there at 10:30 a.m. expecting our room was not ready, but we  we were  able to go to our room.  The room was large enough, and had a nice patio with a great view from the 9th floor. The elevators were working well, and we had very little waiting time. The staff in all areas were very friendly and willing to help.  Our breakfast was included in the price, and it was very well set up, and delicious. The location was amazingly central to so many things, many choices of restaurants very close to the hotel. We went to the bar on the top floor, but though you could see the Eiffel Tower all lit up, it was not an inviting atmosphere. They wanted you buying drinks and not just coming for a picture. They only really The bathtub was so high off the ground you needed to be a gymnast just to get in.  I hurt my hip getting in and could hardly walk the next day.  It still hurts six days later. I told the woman at the front desk and she said she would alert somebody.  I haven't heard a thing from the hotel as of yet. Terrible New Year’s Eve party at this super touristic but not qualitative at all hotel! Bad underground location, no windows, no decor, really bad music, bad Organisation! A village level partyIt did not worth at all the money! Complete disaster! No value for money. Do not go for events at this hotel! Complete overvalued!  Get a new experience of in-room breakfast with Eiffel view. Room 216 can be a good choice for you. Staffs in general are helpful especially the concierge one who can provide restaurant, cafe recommendation and booking. The room is quite spacious even the standard room.  I could not stop myself from writing down a review to this esteem hotel for making our stay such a memorable one. I cannot thank enough Mr. Ali benaicha and his staff for making our stay an experience to remember for life. Me\\xa0and my mother thoroughly enjoyed the stay and we are sure that we are going to come back to Paris to stay at this property.\\xa0Every staff member with whom we came in contact was attentive, kind and professional especially the guy in front desk “ Mudathar” also the amazing guy we met in the restaurant “Akli”. \\xa0This hotel is the address if someone wishes to come to Paris and enjoy a luxurious stay, and we will certainly recommend this hotel to all our family and friends. Excellent service. Stunning view of the Eiffel towere from our balcony, The room is gorgeous, comfortable and spacious. Definitely will be recommending this hotel to family and friends. If you’re looking for a hotel that has everything you need in Paris, luxury and view, this is the one. The room view is sooooo good, recommend to request high floor to not hearing a noise disturb from the road and any smell of cigaratte from ground floor ( im on second floor so i experienced both of them) but i dont mind. Eiffel view is perfect for me!  We stayed here for 4 rooms for 2 nights. It was close to the train station.   Rooms were flashy and had good comfortable beds. I had a great sleep.   Bathroom was clean but poorly designed. I'm not sure what designer was thinking. There was no door at all. If there are 2 people in the bathroom one has to go out of the bathroom while the other person is taking shower.  Also, the shower gel and other liquid wasn't refilled.   One night the room door got jammed and the keycard didn't work and the hotel staff acted as if we didn't know how to use the card. They made us go up and down 3 times and finally we had to tell them to come with us and can check it. It took them almost 2 hours to get it repaired. Issues like this happens but if front staff had called technician earlier we You pay over $600 in one night hotel and there is no  security in the lobby. Literally just 2 mins and and setting my bag down to check in it was stolen.There was no compensation just chocolates  and some juice  and them saying  sorry for the incident . That was it . I found  it very unporfessional as I worked in the hospitality industry in  the  passed and i would have took care of my guest to the maximum. Never again I or friends or family will stay in pullman hotel brand .  Be carfeful! Hotel fabulous location close to the    Eiffel Tower and the toot toot bus stop great for touring Paris. Breakfast at the Pullman was a good selection room was clean and good standard. Staff very helpful and professional. Would recommend this hotel only thing is maybe upgrade the windows for soundproofing a bit more if a light sleeper as street noise can be heard other than that great stay Our second stayed in Patis at Pullman Eiffel Tower the hotel has such a great location and great view but quite expensive and the breakfast was overcrowded with people could not move.   Overall, just great location, location, location and a great view. Just back from a stay at this hotel, firstly I wasn’t sure what to expect due to some very mixed reviews of the hotel.  I needn’t have worried it was a fantastic stay.   I’m afraid I didn’t get any names but the young lady that helped 2 newly single ladies check into their instagramable room to the lovely gentleman in the evening that sorted us out an extra quilt and made my evening by complimenting my perfume and said I smelt like vanilla caramel.   The bathroom was lovely clean and modern, the room and bed comfy and clean.  But the best part was the amazing view from the balcony. Sitting outside even on 23rd November was so special - yes it really is that good to see the Eiffel Tower that close.   the only negative was the slightly confusing room rate and bill.  But overall a We arrived on the 9th November 2023 at 11.30am. We was greeted by the door staff at reception and checked in. The room was already waiting for us to checkin.  Our room was the 5th floor with the Eiffel Tower view from the balcony. Amazing kingsize comfy bed with fluffy pillows and big warm quilt and a great location to all tourist sites.  We stayed for 4 nights We would like to say thank you to all the staff who made our stay amazing. Especially the guest relation team member she was called Ndèye for spoiling us with champagne, nuts, and lovely card and heart shaped balloon for our anniversary. (The card was full of rose petals).  We look forward to staying at this hotel in the future thank you for a warm welcome at the Pullman Paris.  They charge deposit and you will have to communicate with differnet group of teams by email to get it back. I stayed there from 29-OCT to 1-Nov and until now. no response for releasing the deposit left back into my account. bad communication and careless for providing the support as they only do before you make the payment for your satisfaction after that. what you get is what you get and that is worst experience for me. It says they have a roof top patio overlooking the tower, but they do not. Staff are not helpful, nor friendly.  The rooms have no temperature control and it is stifling.  The cleaning staff are not very thorough, but this was not a big deal.  I have never written a review in my life on here, but I needed to for this hotel. First of all, I must say we have eaten at some of the top 20 restaurants in the world in Paris this trip and the service and people have been excellent. Very friendly and helpful. This hotel is located by the Eiffel Tower and although we have a balcony view of it, it’s not a great hotel. The tower is no longer lit up by 11:30 pm. The front desk staff are not helpful. For example, our plug in quit working in the bathroom, and they didn’t send anyone to fix it, upon our request.  Secondly, we asked for a wine opener and they said we either take our bottle down to the bar to open, or we pay guest services for one. Imagine! No wine opener in our room in France! And the bar……each night, we would pop in We left our bags earlier in the day and checked in around 5pm. We were given the keys to our room and when we entered there was a balloon and card for another guest. It made the room feel like it wasn’t ours. It was upsetting after spending so much money on the room. We went to call downstairs to see if they gave us the wrong room and then SURPRISE the phone/iPad system did not work. We then went downstairs and the people at the front desk were confused and not helpful. A man at the front desk says “can you show me the room” and he comes upstairs and enters the room with us. He says that it was just a mistake and the card wasn’t meant for us. He then takes a long phone call in the room with us, while we stand in silence. We then have to tell him about the phone that doesn’t Just imagine they charge for water @6-8 euros for bottle to be provided in the room through housekeeping and room service. Pathetic! The staff was good and courteous but they were helpless as they said the hotel Policies are such.  Ok hotel partial view of Eiffel Tower because your a block away. Expensive , not a huge room. Staff was ok , bell staff probably more then front desk staff. Breakfast was the highlight, came with the room fee. I guess I felt you can do better as to choices to stay. Close to the Tower and the Rodin   museum . Paris is all about your wallet so be prepared to play This hotel is wonderful.  The location is next to the Eiffel Tower, plenty of restaurants and shops in the area.  The breakfast buffet (complementary) is fantastic, rooms were comfortable as was the bed. I highly recommend this hotel. Its a good property and is centrally located with good staff at front desk. Its well managed too. It had good breakfast spread with variety of items to choose from. Overall a good place to stay in Paris The reason why people book this hotel, and there's one reason only--is the proximity to the Eiffel Tower. Do not book here for luxury or even cleanliness. However, I knew I wasn't booking  5 or even 4 star hotel. It is amazing to be able to come out front and take pix with the Eiffel Tower. In addition, there are 3 restaurants that seem to be open until early in the morning--so again, location, location, location! (However be careful bc they do have lots of hidden fees, for mediocre food when you receive your check.) But anyway back to the Pullman, my room was a garden view and the balcony was nice. However, the carpets are filthy an should have been deep cleaned before anyone was assigned this room. Also, there are literal holes in the wall where the toilet dispenser goes. The Great location, but I give it a 3 star because of the tub and shower. It's the most idiotic set up ever. Slippery as hell,almost fell and hit my head. Other than that everything else was satisfactory including the elevators which a lot of people complained about.  The bathroom was dirty, I had to squish a bug on the floor, and there was an open half-used orange juice in the refrigerator.  But my biggest issue is that I attempted to add one night to my reservation via email over a month in advance. The person corresponding with me (Ana) insisted I book it online myself and email her both reservation numbers and she would then combine my booking.  I did this, and she replied that it was confirmed and combined, but when I arrived the staff told me I had two different rooms, and need to check out of my room at 11am on my last day and leave my belongings in their baggage room until 4pm when I need to return to the hotel to check in again.   They were rude and not helpful at all, even though the second room I booked actually costs more (both Excellent staff, great position within 2 mins to the Eiffel Tower. Breakfast very good too. If you want something near to the Eiffel Tower this is as good as it gets for a fair price. The staff were outstanding, all very happy to serve us. Would def come back here with my wife if we were to come back to Paris. The customer service is terrible. They did not clean our room, the I pad in the room never worked and they promised to fix it and never did anything. For 600.00 per night they would only give us two bottles of water. The only good thing is the breakfast and convenient location. They stay here was okay. This was my second time staying at this hotel with the span of a few years. The first time I loved it. The room was nice and clean. The staff, both times were amazing! Though one of the housekeeping staff members entered our room despite the do not disturb sign on the door BUT everything was okay. The staff overall was very attentive and accommodating. The location of the hotel is wonderful also. It is within walking distance from the Effiel Tower and quite a few other places. My complaint is that the hotel is starting to look worn. The carpeting had so many stains in it, it was disgusting. The elevators are tiny, and you can end up waiting for a while to get on one. We stayed in a much nicer boutique hotel for the remainder of our trip. A couple days at We booked through Expedia & paid for a room with a balcony & Eiffel Tower view, it was 100% worth it. We were able to sit out with coffees & watch the tower glitter at night. We arrived ed before check in time & we were offered a room on the second floor that was ready but they advised if we wanted a better view to come back at 3pm check in time & we could get this. We did, and had a room on the fourth floor and I couldn’t fault it. The room is clean and very modern, we were there during the Rugby World Cup 23 & were given some rugby themed gifts by staff. The bathroom is very spacious. I was very pleased with this room, if it seems out of your price range you could book this place for just one night to enjoy the views (this is what we did!)  I’m not one to write reviews on here, but this is one that I unfortunately cannot avoid. We arrived at the hotel around noon, and was told that our room would not be ready for at least another 2-3 hours, as the receptionist said check in was at 3 PM but he said our room could be ready at 2 PM. I left the front desk my phone number and asked for them to call me when the room was ready. 3 hours go by, and I had yet to receive a call. About another hour later, I call the hotel because we were wandering the streets of Paris waiting for our room, and then they tell us the room is ready. When I questioned why no one called me saying that the room is ready, the representative goes “well maybe they were just busy.”   Right from there, I should have known that staying at this hotel was Nadhir and the team at the Pullman made our recent trip to Paris so special. The views from our rooms of the Eiffel Tower were magnificent. Nadhir and the team also organised little gifts for the girls, beret's and fancy hot chocolate, biscuits and chocolate - all to make their stay special and memorable. We all loved it - I would recommend this hotel in a heart beat, their service is fabulous as it their location. If you stay at this hotel it is for the amazing views of the Eiffel Tower and for the pictures.  The photos and memories of being on the balcony looking at the Eiffel Tower in all its splendor cannot be denied.   When we arrived we were impressed with proximity of hotel to the Eiffel Tower. Definitely within walking distance, 7 minutes, we could even see our hotel when we climbed up the tower later that day . The view itself is spectacular!! We were upgraded to a suite top floor (9th floor) with a balcony. My kids had a seperate room , the view with no balcony, twin beds. They loved the view. That was an experience of a lifetime.   Breakfast was good. I did feel it was overpriced for what you get, cereal, fruit, eggs, different teas, water. But the selection was enormous and An amazing experience. All the staff are fabulous and welcoming from the first second we entered the hotel. The rooms are amazing. Fabulous location. Breakfast is excellent. We didn't want to leave. This hotel is faultless! If you go on businesses trip they doesn’t want to send or give you basic commercial invoice. People doesn’t want to share even their full name through email so they know they doing something wrong. It’s unacceptable that they can’t provide commercial invoice and we paid almost 2000€ This is a very good hotel. The location is central and lots of the sights are within easy distance. The events/reservations team were very helpful before our stay and during. This hotel has one of the best breakfasts I have ever seen. The rooms are some of the largest and modern in Paris. If you are looking for a standard western hotel opposed Parisian boutique, I’d highly recommend. The only downsides are that the reception is very slow and the rooms are in need of a little TLC. We stayed in the Trocadero suite and I was a little disappointed in the suite, as there were lots of little things that were broken or well worn. The Eiffel Tower views are 10/10. All I can say is location, location, location .   We had a Eiffel Tower view room and we’re upgraded to a suite (104) all I can say is spend the money on a balcony with the tower view. It’s worth every cent!   I would say this is where I want to stay again, why? Sitting 3-4 times a day admiring the tower on my balcony as we have breakfast, watching the light show….spectacular view.   Our tour to palace of Versailles was from the hotel as the meeting point. When we did the hop on hop off bus stop 8 & 9 is here and lastly we could walk to our river cruise. Very convenient .   Restaurants all in meters from the hotel and a supermarket   We didn’t eat here or got to the bay on level 10.   Staff were helpful in every aspect. I could not fault anything as we are sad to leave The location was fantastic!  We had a balcony and an awesome view of the Eiffel Tower.  It was an easy walk to the ET as well as to the hop on / off bus.  Also really close to Le Pont de Dir-Hakeim Bridge where we had to meet for a dinner cruise along the Seine.  The hotel was also the meeting point for a number of tours including the Claude Monet Gardens tour and the Versailles Palace.  The Australian Embassy was also in the same street.  Across the road was a stadium where there were numerous events during our stay.  The hotel itself was really nice and service was exceptional.  The Hotel Restaurant was first class with regards to service food and ambience.  Breakfast was a treat as well.  The room was a good size given it was in the city.  The balcony made it that much We booked Pullman Eiffel Tower back in January.  Initially, we were a little apprehensive due to a few of the negative reviews but we took our chances and glad we did!!!! Everything and I mean everything from the minute we arrived to the minute we left was absolutely phenomenal! We arrived and were on a tight schedule. Staff realized that and helped us get checked-in quickly (the hotel was so busy), stored our bags so that we could start our excursion just as we planned within 30 minutes of our arrival and checked in with us every morning if everything was ok. The view from our room was breathtaking especially at night and the breakfast buffet was like nothing we have seen before. We expected a small set-up like other hotels but the Pullman Eiffel Tower took it to the next level I was completely unhappy and dissatisfied. This was my birthday evening I had been waiting months excited about staying at this hotel. The nonchalantness of the staff and management is crazy. Seems this hotel is more focused  on the location being near the Eiffel Tower, not service and comfort. The experience I received and customer service was terrible ruined my birthday evening. If that wasn’t enough I requested my invoice received someone else’s with their stay and information. At  there rates it absolutely was not the experience I was expecting. To say unhappy with quality of my stay is an understatement. My recent stay at this hotel offered a breathtaking view of the Eiffel Tower, which was undoubtedly the highlight of the experience. The sight of the iconic landmark illuminated against the night sky was truly mesmerizing and made for unforgettable moments.  However, I must admit that my overall impression was slightly dampened by the lack of friendliness from some of the hotel staff. While not all encounters were negative, there were instances where I felt the staff could have been more accommodating and welcoming.\"},\n",

The hotel was very clean, staff friendly and the room was spotless.  The beds were also quite comfortable. We have been there on a family sightseeing-trip including a Disneyland-day. The staff was very warm, friendly and helpful. The rooms were modern and clean, just perfect. And last but not least the hotel is situated next to a metro station from where you can get everywhere in the city center within minutes and to Disneyland within about 1 hour. Full recomendation! The best !!! You can enjoy here definitely.  Everything is near the hotel. Eiffeltour is max. 10min faraway, across the street is a supermarket and pharmacy and next to hotel you have nice pizzeria. :)) You cannot beat the location! An easy walk to the Eiffel Tower and right across from the metro that will take you to any location across the entire city. The neighborhood is charming and full of great options for food and drink. And the people at the hotel are beyond friendly. They welcomed us warmly with pastries and allowed us late checkout without hesitation. Highly recommend and would definitely stay again! We truly enjoyed this hotel. They offered so many things that we were looking for. One of which was space for three people two adults one child it met all her expectations with that. The location was amazing because it was next to the subway and train station. We are walking distance from everything we needed. The customer service there was exceptional. They were able to schedule us a taxi to the airport with no issues. We were truly amazed at the customer service we received while in Paris this hotel is a must stay.  The hotel is close to transportation, sites/museums, stores, restaurants, laundry, pharmacies, pastries, farmers market, overall the staff are very accommodating, and I would definitely stay here again.  Booked 3 rooms for 4 nights, it’s an updated boutique style hotel. EXTREMELY CLEAN, Great Customer Service. Instead of choosing the breakfast option, we just went with going to the bakery next door- we got 2 large croissants & oj for 5 euros. The Starbucks is under renovation next door for those Starbucks fans ( but no worries you don’t hear the construction inside hotel or outside). The rooms were a bit small, some smaller than the other - we couldn’t change it was a sold out week, but the cleanliness made up for it!  Thank you for great customer service, hospitality, and a great housekeeping staff ! & for making my first time in Paris wonderful! This hotel was wonderful. The location is great near most attractions In Paris. It’s next to several wonderful cafe’s and several grocery stores.  the staff was very nice the rooms were clean and beds were very comfortable. The bathrooms were beautiful.  The room was not renovated like the photos portrayed. The room we received had dated furniture, the curtain rod was broken, when opening the window; the window it completely came off the hinges. The rug/carpet was in very poor condition and looked very dirty. The bathroom looked like it had not been updated since the 1950's. The photos reflected a boutique hotel that had been fully renovated in the last 3-5 years, and this could not have been further from reality. I booked the Superior Room and was extremely disappointed.  The hotel is east to find with its white exterior and large letters identifying it on a busy street near the Eiffel Tower.   Lots of nice cafes next door and the metro stop is steps from the lobby. The reception area is modern, clean and spacious with a friendly, professional and very helpful staff. Everything is up to date in the public areas, and the hotel has room for 4 with luggage.   The room is clean, comfortable, well lit, and the beds are excellent.   The bathroom has a great shower with more room than usual for Europe.  We would stay here the next time we are in Paris. The hotel location was very convenient with Metro access right out the door.  Neighborhood was busy with lost of people and we felt safe and comfortable our entire visit.  The staff was very helpful and responsive and all spoke English.  Breakfast was good and easy to access. It was our first time in Paris and this hotel was absolutely perfect in every way. Location,accommodation, get the suite great size room. Train is literally across the street so we were able to visit so many beautiful places near and far. They have amazing restaurants all around. So many surprises like a farmers market on Sunday one block away. We were safe and it felt like a dream. We will stay at this hotel when we visit again. We loved this hotel.  The staff was very helpful. There is a Metro right out front so it was so convenient to get anywhere. Good air conditioning and elevator, which is not always the case in Paris.  Breakfast was good. Location, cleanliness, knowledgeable staff and a decent price too. Metro,  restaurants, shops and pastry stores are right outside the door. Quaint sitting area in front of the hotel. I’ll stay here again.  Great hotel in a great location! Victoria and Valerie at the front desk helped me with an issue and they were friendly and very helpful! The hotel is posh, clean, great breakfast, and by far the best bathroom and room we have ever had! When you travel across the world and walk into your room and you grin  from ear to ear....you know you've done right! Bravo Hotel Tourisme!!!! Very nice hotel!  We liked that it is really close to the Eiffel Tower and metro station with 3 lines. Clean rooms, nice and friendly personal.  We had a comfortable stay and would love to come back again soon. Really good location, super easy check in and check out the staff was amazing and helped whenever we had questions. We had one of the larger rooms it was perfect for a family of 4. Clean, bathroom was great had a tub and shower which was great for the small kids. Tons of restaurants to choose from within a block or two. Easy walk to Eiffel Tower. Access to metro right next door. Overall was a great stay and would highly recommend. Location is really good. People are very kind. Starbucks and good cafes are very close. Metro station is also very close. The most important is that going to Eiffel tower is very easy. We were so happy. It's a small hotel but close or walkable to everything to do in Paris. It's clean but has beautiful decor. The receptionist specially Chesca was very helpful & knowledgeable. She's trilingual. So many restaurants around the hotel to choose from close to metro / subway too. I highly recommend this hotel & will go back if we're back in Paris This hotel is a small boutique with only 4 floors. Well situated by the metro, several restaurants on the street to select from, and just a short walk to Rue Commerce which has some great shopping Staff is friendly and rooms are comfortable.  Beds and linens are lovely and it has a Toto toilet 👍 Nice Hotel only a few minutes away from Eiffel tower. 3 Metro lines in Front of the hotel, supermarket and restaurants very close. Small but nice and clean rooms, good bed, very friendly and helpful personal, very good breakfast buffet.  The hotel was spectacular and the staff was amazing. I recommend Voco Holiday Inn to antobe visiting Paris. The drinks and food at restaurant Romoco, downstairs was great too. Tourists sites were 30 minutes away. We've just returned from a 25 day tour of Europe - and this was by far our favourite hotel. The staff are unbelievably friendly and helpful, the rooms are immaculate and comfortable and the location (to the Metro and Eiffel Tower) can't be beaten. Thank you, Hotel Tourisme Avenue, for your hospitality!  Excellent hotel in a great neighbourhood. We walked everywhere. So close to many great restaurants and shops, with easy access to the metro. We stayed in a family suite on the 1st floor and it was very spacious and met all of our needs, enough space for the 4 of us. Beautiful hotel in the heart of Paris. The restaurant next door was our favorite for onion soup!  Walking to the Eiffel at night was safe.  Staff was so helpful and kind❤️ Close to the Hop on and Hop off. Coffee in Lobby was a plus!  I would stay here again! Jessica at the front desk made our trip exceptional. A member of our group broke a tooth to root, and she was able to get us a dentist on a Saturday the week before Bastille celebrations. We were leaving Monday and our friend was in severe pain. She also helped us with translating and recommendations. The hotel is in a Superb location, near Eiffel Tower. We are so happy we chose to stay in this area. We explored all major points of interest throughout the Paris city center and are grateful that we chose this hotel. All other areas were noisy, construction and lots of tourists. The French restaurant next was excellent, authentic French food with locals who were extremely friendly. Great location to bus and metro. Straight shot bus to Sacre Coeur. You could hear the elevated train from the room, but it was not disturbing at night. Walking distance to Eiffel tower  and many restaurants with outdoor seating.  Clean room; his and her closets. Reading lights over bedstands. Person at front desk 24/ 7; front desk arranged cab to airport at 5:30 am for us, checked out at 5:30,  no problem.    Bathroom a little small. Hair dryer a little weak for drying hair.  Shower was great. Under sink shelf in bathroom provided additional needed counter space. Breakfast bar was excellent. Cafe au laite was great; a couple hot options as well as cold, and the staff cooked fresh scrambled eggs for us (probably an exceptional situation as we were early on a Saturday and none had Hotel was in a great location, many places to eat in close proximity to hotel and walking distances to the Eiffel Tower. Room set up was great for family of 3. The hotel was clean and staff was friendly.  Amazing location. Cafes everywhere and so close to the Eiffel Tower! The room was very comfortable and cool- a must for the summer. The staff was very friendly and informative. I would absolutely recommend staying here again!  Location is convenient.  Room is clean. Staff is friendly.  Bathroom is large but has no ventilation and doesn’t smell so great.    I would not choose this hotel again as I do not enjoy listening to loud music (bad covers of songs such as “volare” and “celebration” sung to a pounding drum machine to midnight every night) right outside my window and being driven nuts by a night light that randomly turns on and off despite by best efforts to destroy it.  Hotel staff not very responsive to the light problem and they say they can do nothing about the nightly late night noise. The train is near, have stores and restaurants near  For me was sure , clean and comfort place if sometime return to Paris I will sure to stay here again,for me  is like stayed in home  I recommend this place with 100 pounto Incredible location and staff.  Super clean and taken care of property right on the metro station (three different lines converge here).  Surrounded by restaurants and bakeries.  Only 15 minute walk to Eiffel Tower.  Plenty of shopping, grocery stores, markets around.  Would highly recommend staying here when in Paris - was very pleased and they made our first visit to Paris super enjoyable.  Staff is multilingual.  Can't say enough good things about the property, location, and people here. My party of around 6 people have stayed here for a number of years, the staff are really helpful and very friendly, and responsive to requests. The rooms are very clean and comfortable, excellent location right next to the metro, walking distance to the Seine & Eiffel Tower. Would recommend.  The hotel is in a great location, right across the street from a Metro station. The room was small, but very functional. The staff was pleasant and very easy to deal with. There are lots of dining options in the immediate area. It felt like a very safe area. We did hear the Metro trains at night but were easily able to sleep through it. I thought the hotel was good value for the cost. GREAT location and super friendly and helpful staff. 15 min walk to the Eiffel Tower. 30 to L'Arc de Triumphe. Metro stop right in front, and tons of restaurants and cafes right outside the front door. Very nice hotel and an excellent location. All the staff were very friendly and helpful.  We had a business room, which was really nice, but a little small for 2 people. This did not spoil anything, as we were out most of the day exploring Paris. Towels were changed daily and the room was cleaned very well too. Unfortunately the only English TV channel we could get to work was BBC news, as the other English ones would not work, but not a big issue. I would definitely return to this hotel again but would book a larger room.   The hotel is near: the metro, the taxi stop, starbucks, mcdonalds and many restaurants! You can also go to the wiffel tower walking. The room is well sound isolated, there is an amazing washing toilet and you can make coffe, chocolate or tea by yourself in your bed! a perfect hotel! 10 minute walk to Eiffel, 2 minutes to Metro, and many restaurants.  Everyone at the hotel was so nice and helpful.  The room was small but had lots of counter space both in the bathroom and room. There was a closet on each side of the bed. The bed was was comfortable. Would definitely recommend! Also, Starbucks right next to hotel and McDonalds across the street. Not only was the hotel wonderful, the staff were amazing. I felt so comfortable here. The beds were the best I’ve slept in on the trip. The location of the was perfect, we had wonderful walks and the Eiffel Tower was only a short stroll away. Make sure you visit the Eiffel Tower at 10pm, magical! service was very good room a bit too small food was fairly good we liked the hotels location in the city  we would  tell our friends to stay at your hotel when we. return to Paris  we would stay at your place but in a larger room  \"},\n",

After This lovely hotel has a wonderful helpful staff and a great location, steps from the Saint Paul Metro and a shopping area with helpful amenities. We easily traveled all over Paris while enjoying the Marais neighborhood in particular. Traveling with a teen, we had a triple on the top floor of the hotel. The room featured a spacious shower, TV, refrigerator, wifi, hairdryer and a truly comfortable fold out sofa bed for the kid.  There is a small elevator, and someone on duty at the desk to buzz guests in. Couldn\\'t of been happier staying here really!  Staff at check-in and during our whole stay were friendly, helpful, simply fabulous!  Rooms a bit small but very comfortable and clean. Most importantly, A/C worked perfectly!!!  Temperatures during our stay in Paris were running 96F/35C.  So nice to get back to our room and cool off. Location in the city is really good! Close to metro which should be taken advantage of regardless of the weather.  Also,  the neighborhood, quiet and felt very safe. Dining suggestions from the staff were perfect as well.  Would definitely stay here again! This hotel is in such a great location.  Our rooms faced the street, and there is quite a bit of noise. Night usually is less noisy, but if sirens go by (happened often enough) or loud cars, it\\'s disturbing.  All rooms with 2 beds face street, rooms with one bed face courtyard(much quieter). White noise app is helpful for noise.   Rooms are a very good size by European standards. By North American, they\\'d be considered small, but we had enough room for 2 of our suitcases and such. Bathroom is a good size which was a very nice surprise in Europe.  I found the mattress on my bed a little soft and sunk in, so a bit uncomfortable, but was able to sleep ok.  This its a very clean hotel as well. Front desk staff is pleasant, as is housekeeping. Before our trip I emailed a few times to TL;DR: Pros: Perfect if you\\'re looking for a no-frills, centrally located basecamp in a fantastic neighborhood and aren’t planning on spending much time in the room. Cons: The hotel could make a few improvements to the room and some communication issues with the staff need to be addressed. True rating would be closer to 3.5.   Grand Mahler is a modern hotel in an old building. The existing footprint is very small and the elevator and rooms match this scale. I booked a Superior Double Room, which is supposed to be slightly larger than a Standard Double Room. I\\'m not sure it mattered because there was only just enough space to walk around after we got creative with where to store our luggage. The bed and sheets are extremely comfortable. The AC works perhaps a bit too well. Our This hotel is our \\'go to\\' in Paris. Convenient location close to a metro station and buses and walking distance to some of the main sites. Plenty of places to eat within the neighbourhood. The room we were allocated was a little on the small side but this is an old building and we weren\\'t in Paris to sit in our room! The bed was very comfortable. My husband and I stayed at this small, comfortable hotel for 5 days at the end of April.  We had the top floor, street facing triple room.  By European standards this was a large room, but with the extra bed out it would have been difficult to move around, especially with the sloped ceiling.  The hotel was quiet and the front desk staff was friendly and helpful.  The elevator is teeny tiny and barely fit two people.  We did not take breakfast but our room did have a Nescafe for coffee and tea, and also a small refrigerator.  Our room was clean with an updated bathroom (toilet in a separate closet) and the bed was comfortable.  The location is ideal with many restaurants and shops right around the corner and the St Paul metro station less than a 5 minute walk away.  It was an We stayed here for 2 nights over the bank holiday weekend. Room was clean and totally perfect for our stay. Location in Le Marais was great. Loads of bars, cafés, shops and restaurants around. Would definitely recommend and will return.  We stayed here on our first time in Paris and this hotel is in one of the best areas to be in. Le Marais is a hip area with a lot of night life and restaurants. The hotel itself is simple but clean and the staff was amazing! Breakfast was great too!! Super convenient location, great service and the price is fair. We chose this hotel primarily on location and price (both of which were really good) and we were more than happy with our choice.  The location is ideal - a short walk to the metro at St Paul and in a relatively quiet side street. Much less noise than I would have expected.  The room was small but comfortable, the hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff were uniformly helpful and friendly.  Overall we were really happy and we would definitely stay there again. We spent four nights in this hotel and couldn\\'t have been happier. The rooms were spotless and very comfortable (special shout-out for the unusually large bathroom), and there was even excellent air conditioning. Best of all is the truly perfect location, literally a one-minute walk from the St. Paul metro (on line 1, which takes you to many sightseeing points of interest) and in the heart of The Marais, which is full of stores and restaurants. The price was appropriate to this location. This isn\\'t a \"full concierge service-type hotel\", which some previous reviewers seem to have expected, but we weren\\'t expecting that and thought the staff was uniformly polite and helpful whenever we did interact with them. I\\'m very happy to have found this hotel and fully intend to return. I can not wait to stay at this hotel! Our trip is cancelled for April 2020 and the communication, compassion and humanity from Lucas (owner, I presume) has been so endearing.  I am so happy with my decision to have chosen this hotel he has stayed in constant dialogue with me to help work out this awful situation we are in.  I would give this hotel 10 stars if I could. When I do get to this hotel....I’m staying for a while! We loved our stay at the Grand Hotel Malher for our first trip to Paris! The room was beautiful and very clean. We were extremely close to the Metro which we used extensively throughout our trip - it\\'s SO EASY to navigate. Le Marais is such a beautiful, charming neighborhood with excellent restaurants and wonderful people watching with a glass of wine or a cup of coffee and a croissant.   The staff was very friendly and the hotel was in the perfect location to be away from major touristy sites but close enough to the Metro (literally one block) to get everywhere quickly. We loved getting drinks at La Favorite on our walk back from a day doing touristy things! Great location and good rooms but the staff should not have a service providing job as they seem to find it annoying to have guests around. Not a ”hello”, ”how are you?” or even ”how was your stay?” upon check out. Well, he actually didn’t say good bye when we left. Incredibly rude.  Lovely little hotel, tucked in behind the main street. Less than a minute to the station ( St Paul’s) which we used to zip around Paris for the few days we were there. Having travelled halfway around the world to see Paris, we didn’t spend much time at the hotel. The room was small, as we expected, but clean & well appointed. It was still warm weather when we were there, so we used the aircon to cool the room, but it was great to be able to have the windows open at night. A little bar fridge in the cupboard to pop your refreshing beer in for post touring relaxing. The front desk staff were very friendly & helpful.  It’s such a pretty place, with lots of good eating within walking distance, we’d definitely stay there again.  The location of the hotel cannot be beat. It\\'s right in the middle of Le Marais, a short pleasant walk to all the hip boutiques, Picasso Museum, great cafes and restaurants, Place de Vosges and Victor Hugo\\'s house. Best off all, it\\'s a 3 minute walk to the metro stop( line 1). The room is clean, bed and pillows very comfortable( queen sized bed), and bathroom was recently remodeled. Room is regular European size that you would get in most hotels of the same caliber anywhere in Europe. That said, we did manage to lay down two suitcases and still have room to walk around! Based on some other reviews I had expected the staff to be not so pleasant, but we were in for a very nice surprise. The staff is actually quite friendly and helpful. Of course, if you are hoping for wide toothy Some people before me have complained about small rooms and the tiny lift....but that’s Paris! I was pleasantly surprised with the size of my single room, it had a double bed so perhaps it was a double room and their singles were all full?? It was clean and tidy and serviced daily. The air conditioning was fabulous (it was 41 degrees a couple of days during my stay) and the wifi was excellent. Breakfast consisted of a fresh croissant, a pastry and a half bagel with condiments and juice and tea/coffee or hot chocolate. Not amazing but adequate. If I hadn’t pre-paid for it I would have ventured out to one of the many Boulangeries in the neighbourhood. The location is superb and so close to Rue des Rosiers and many other fabulous local streets with everything you could imagine on The best thing about the hotel is its location. It\\'s about a block from the St. Paul metro and bus stop, and walking distance from many Parisian points of interest. I stayed five nights at the end of a four-week trip to France, and every day when I would take the escalator up from the Metro I would look around and smile. The Marais feels like a real neighborhood - it\\'s busy but not crazy, with plenty of restaurants and stores and a nice overall feel. While there were other tourists around, there were also plenty of Parisians going about their daily lives.   My room was comfortable and well maintained with, thank goodness, good air conditioning (I was there for the start of La Canicule in late June). My windows looked out on a courtyard and it was remarkably quiet, even on Fête We stayed here at the beginning and end of our month long France and Italy holiday. The location was great for us, within walking distance of the Seine, Notre Dame cathedral. Unfortunately we won\\'t be staying here again. The rooms  #14 and 15 are very small and with our 4 large suitcases our stay was uncomfortable to say the least.  We had to store some of our suitcases on the bed because otherwise there wasn\\'t enough floor space to allow us to walk around the beds. The beds were okay but the pillows were very flat and caused more than one stiff neck. On one occasion the coffee packs weren\\'t  replaced after a room clean. We had to ask the front desk for more and he ended up bringing us cream instead. A used coffee cup was also not replaced. After one look at the \"breakfast\" we GHM is located right next to the Saint-Paul bus (#69) and metro (#1) stops, making it an ideal home base outside of the touristy area of the city. The Saint-Paul neighborhood is charming, with many cafes and restaurants very close by. They offer breakfast, but we chose to eat directly across the street in a lovely cafe called La Favorite. The shower is AMAZING (a \"rain shower\") and the A/C works well. Check-in is literally saying \"Hello\" and getting your room key. The concierge was nice but didn\\'t really tell us anything (including that they sold a discounted museum pass at the hotel). Room is comfortable and clean if a little small. The biggest, and really only, drawback is the incredibly spotty wifi. It\\'s an unsecured network, and the connection is slow. The hotel is okay. The staff is friendly and attentive. When my girlfriend was having trouble with the hairdryer in the bathroom, the concierge gave her one of the back-ups that they have. The elevator is very small; it can fit one person with a suitcase. The air conditioning is very strong; though the room became a bit stuffy when we turned it off. (This was in June, so I can\\'t imagine this would be the case in the autumn or winter.) The WiFi is a little iffy; at times it\\'s very fast, and at others it slows to a crawl. Upon checking in the staff was very pleasant. The gentleman was very helpful in showing us the best ways to get around the city. Hotel was in a great location. Rooms were surprisingly spacious and very clean. Would stay there again!  My daughter and I stayed in Room 1 for 3 nights.  Room 1 faces the inner courtyard.  The room was very quiet and clean.  The shower facility was quite nice.  The hotel was centrally located and, therefore, it was easy to walk to where we wanted to go, take the subway or Uber.  There are many nice restaurants and bars near the hotel.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  I cannot say enough nice things about the hotel. I arranged a three day trip to Paris with our grandson and his partner. The Marais district was recommended and I selected this hotel for the convenience of location.  I spoke directly to the hotel, Austin answered all my queries and sorted out rooms for us on first and second floors, much appreciated.  The Grand Malher is very comfortable with compact rooms but everything needed for your stay.  The bathrooms are very good with lovely hot water.  We stayed in room 12 and 22 which overlooked an inner courtyard and extremely quiet.  I would recommend this hotel for all the above comments and for the really friendly, helpful staff. This cute little hotel is placed right in the center of my favorite part of Paris. There are plenty of nice restaurants around and the shopping is great. Go and lay down in the grass at Place des Vosges if the sun is shining. Our room is small and has a view to the little courtyard. It is cute with a comfy bed and nice bathroom. And the check in process was the quickest I ever experienced.  Hotel rooms in Paris are generally small. Nowadays I almost always stay in an apartment while I\\'m in Paris. The price is more or less the same as that of a standard room in a centrally located 3-star hotel but with so much more space.   I\\'d stayed in Grand Hotel Mahler a couple of times both before and after its full renovation and found it satisfactory. In particular, its location can\\'t be beaten. It\\'s right in the Marais area and practically only 1-minute walk from the Saint Paul Metro Station on Line 1. So, when the apartment which is very near GHM and which I usually rent wasn\\'t available for my last night in Paris, I booked GHM for 1 night.   To my great delight, my room was already available when I showed up a litter before noon. It\\'s a single room (Room 30) on the third We were surprised by the smallness of the room called a superior twin, but we appreciated the air-conditioning, the rain shower, and the cleanliness throughout. By the end of our four-day stay, we were very comfortable. This is a safe hotel within steps of a giant busy scene on the Rue de Rivoli.   The hotel is close to the boutiques of the Marais and to the simple neighborhood grocery stores. Ideal for people who want to acquaint themselves with the Marais. My trips to Paris usually centre round this charming hotel. In the cool and groovy Gay section of Paris. It\\'s close to the busy streets and bars but quiet and restful. The lift to the six floors is tiny and great fun as long as you friendly with fellow ascenders. Breakfast is taken in an ancient cellar which like the rest of the hotel is filled with character Stayed here for 1 night. Left my bags at the front desk when my room was not ready and was told they would be delivered to my room. Returned about 8 hrs later to find my bags still in the lobby. Most hotels would have followed through with what they said they would do.  Had a problem getting on the internet and no one could help. Called the front desk and they said read the instructions. Nobody was available to help. Extremely poor service. The location of the hotel is unbeatable. Just across the road is Saint Paul metro, supermarket and there are plenty of restaurants and shops on its doorstep. I had a superior double room on the 6th floor, facing inwards, it was super quiet and very comfortable. While the room looks quite recently furnished, there are some marks of wear, including yellowing on the shower walls which are not too pleasant to look at.  However, overall, I had a great stay and it was very affordable given the location and size of the room. I would definitely come back next time I\\'m in Paris! We were on 5th floor with a balcony, and enjoyed morning croissants and coffee while looking out at the street. The room is SMALL but it is well appointed. Front desk staff was very friendly. Location was great... right in Le Marais area, 3 minute walk to subway, 10 minute walk to Seine. 2 minutes in from main street so great proximity but no traffic noise. Loved everything about it except the room size (and we were in a mid-sized room). This hotel is the equivalent of Hotel Empire in NYC,  ie clean, friendly  English speaking staff,  air conditioning which you need in the summer, phone and private bathroom in a some what small room for about  $250 per night in a central location in Paris. I can’t say enough good things about this hotel ! It has great reviews, which is why i chose it, and it definitely deserves them ! Friendly and helpful staff, comfortable beds, heavenly shower are just a few awesome things. My room was adorable and spacious with a courtyard view, totally charming. I would and hope to, stay here again soon !  This hotel is very cute, and very authentically European (not a complaint!). The room and bathroom were clean, and the hotel was pretty quiet. Some street noise on a Saturday night, but not bad. The biggest selling points IMO are the location (4th arrondissement- and just steps away from the St. Paul metro stop), location, location! This is the neighborhood you have in mind when you picture old Paris, winding narrow streets and cafes and locals on scooters. I would definitely stay here again. Not a grand hotel at all, this little hotel is wonderfully located in the Marais, Paris\\'s chic 3rd arrondissement, just a few blocks from the Place des Vosges and a short work from the Saint Paul metro stop.  The rooms are, as one might expect in Parisian budget hotels, small, but the two of us and all our baggage fit in comfortably.  Bathroom has been recently renovated and is very nice.  WiFi worked well; there is a nice TV (albeit, mostly French-language channels) and a comfortable bed.  Lighting is excellent, often not the case in cheaper hotels.  We arrived on a hot and humid day, and the air-conditioning was wonderful, cooling everything off quite quickly.  Staff spoke English and were helpful, booking a taxi to the airport for us, when the trains were running irregularly Went for a superior twin room, small but good sized shower room and all spotlessly clean and neat.  Some road noise, with the window open, but then quiet overnight.  Didn\\'t try breakfast, only because I don\\'t eat croissants!  Think this place is a great find and would definitely return.  Close to metro. The room was clean, bedding comfortable, bathroom very nice. Friendly staff and perfectly placed near st paul subway station in the marais. Only thing (totally personal), there are no boiler in the room :( all the rest is perfect for a mid range hotel   I have been to Paris more than 100 times so far but only on business. So this was the first time we visited as tourists and obviously the choice of hotel was important even though we did not spend a lot of time there.   The hotel is around 25 minutes away from Gare de Lyon so convenient. Obviously you can take the metro but as I am not a big fan we walked. The hotel as such is in the Rue de Malher, a side street. Initially we thought it was rather small but all that was small was the elevator. Check in was really fast - did not even have to show ID. But the guy was friendly even though not the traditional kind of receptionist.   As mentioned, the elevator is small so 3 people and a medium seized suitcase was a bit tricky. Careful - maximum weight is 240 kg so we were fine.....  First the good, it is a wonderful location and a nice looking building. It\\'s an old building that could use a little work. The elevator is tiny -- it felt like a tight squeeze when two people were in it. The service was a little spotty. Our air conditioning wasn\\'t working properly when we arrived Saturday and the desk clerk said to talk to the front desk on Monday ... that seemed like a long wait for something that should be working ...  also one of the two keys we got wasn\\'t working, and we asked for them to re rekeyed and he said to do that Monday ... really? That seems like it is below the service of a Laquinta or Econolodge or name the budget chain in the US...  The AC just needed to have the filter cleaned -- which raised the question, don\\'t they regularly replace or clean My girlfriend and I had a long planned vacation to Paris and Switzerland. Our original flight out was cancelled due to foreseen circumstances and terrible customer service, so we ended up arriving a day late. The hotel did not charge us for the first night of our reservation that we missed due to the cancelled flight. The customer service was great and it turned our vacation around! '},\n",

Bathrooms were clean and showers were very nice.  The downstairs space is very nice, staff was super helpful and kind. Drinks and food were reasonably priced. There are a few restaurants in the area, HIGHLY recommend the pizza place across the street.  5 minute walk to 2 different metro stations.  Definitely would stay here again.  Thank you! Amazing services provided since day one, always warm and welcoming! Special Kudos for the Bar, always giving their best of the best at any inquiry! And the only place giving out special parties almost every single day! The hostel IS nice to travel solo. On thursdays they have jazz and friday-saturday DJ. So the social atmosphere IS great but staff might help guest to know each other maybe with some games or similar. The music in the bathroom IS not neccesary.  It is clean, and in 20 min you are in the center. There are plenty bars around and on saturdays there IS a good market.  About the room, the locker and height of the bed are not very confortable. Also would It be nice to be able to charge your mobile inside your bed, It would be very handfull a small shelf . One shower in 4 floor were Frozen, not working properly, neither the elevator during 2 days. Very friendly staff, all the people there were nice & respectful. The rooms were nice & had good storage, privacy curtains in beds were nice. Clean bathroom and rooms!! Bar downstairs was very cute, rooftop also fun. Nearby Belleville train which was convenient. Overall nice place!! The staff, rooms, and bar were fantastic. Everyone I met while staying here was friendly. It’s a great place for young and middle aged travelers. The neighborhood also has a lot to offer. There is a market on the street in front of the building that takes place Tuesdays and Fridays. It’s a 5-10 minute walk to the Canal St Martin which is a great place to go for shops, drinks, and food. Easy access to convenience stores as well. A metro station is located right out side the building that lets you get anywhere in Paris. All staff I interacted with spoke English very well. There is also an incredible rooftop area where you can see the surrounding neighborhood and even see the Eiffel Tower. 10/10 experience! I had a reservation for 4 nights, I left the place after night 2. There are mosquitoes full of blood from others and mine flying around and biting as they please. I was terrified of getting a disease from another room mate. They need to add screens to the windows. No air conditioning. It was like a 3rd world bus packed of people rubbing one against another.  I have been in other hostels, Amsterdam, London, Zurich, and they were incredibly clean and well taken care of, at a lower price. The 10 euros breakfast is a joke. I felt robbed by The People. Avoid if you want to be disease free.  BTW I was not offered a refund for neither the room, the breakfasts nor the city tax. Avoid.  Bathrooms are terribly dirty. This was my first real hostel experience and I was worried at first, but I loved it! The rooms and washrooms were very clean, the hostel felt safe, check-in and out was efficient, and the staff were friendly. The literal only part I didn’t like was that the top bunk was SO high and hard to climb it felt dangerous at times, lol, but other than that I have nothing bad to say! I am in love with the working personnel, who were amazing and attentive. The rooms were clean, without any bad smells, and the beds were comfortable. The location is close to the metro, so there is no trouble getting to any point in the city. THE PEOPLE is by far one of the best hotels in Paris, great location (Belleville) amazing team on the frontdesk and specially at the bar, and no matter the request or issue they handle every situation in the most professional way! Such an amazing experience at Les Piaules- The People hostel in Belleville. I am a solo female traveller and I stayed in 2 mixed dorms (8 bunks & 6 bunks) and felt so comfortable and safe. The beds are warm and cozy, the rooms and bathrooms are clean and the shower is hot and quite spacious. The rooftop terrace has Eiffel Tower & Sacre Coeur views and is perfect for admiring the beauty of Paris from above. The staff are super friendly and helpful and speak great English and the bar and patio area is a great place to hang out and meet other travellers! I 100% recommend this hostel for anyone travelling to Paris!!  Great two night stay with the family. Lots of posts saying it didn't feel safe but we felt entirely safe there. Beds were comfy, jazz jam was great.....only downside was checkout was at 12 but the cleaners kept coming in wanting to change the beds so it felt like we were being rushed out. But overall it was a great little place!  This is the best hostel I have ever been.  All the staff members have been extremely kind and proactive for the whole stay.  Bathroom and toilets are extremely clean and nice, there is a hairdryer provided as well. It was my first trip as a solo traveller. I stayed in a female dorm and I felt the area was safe and well connected also at night.  I loved the beds: very clean bed sheets, very comfortable bed and I loved the curtain blind. Next to each bed there is a European socket. There is a dedicated space for luggage which you can lock with your own locker. The bar downstairs is very nice and offers the possibility to buy breakfast for cheap price and other meals for a reasonable price. The Caesar salad was one of the best ones I have ever had.  One negative note: I booked The hotel was wonderful and it exceeded my expectations. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room spacious and clean. I didnt Eat so i Can't Really rate the food, although others looked like they were enjoying the food .i Loved the Downtown location of the hotel. It was a very nice place and the bed curtains gives a great privacy that many hostels don’t have. My single complaint would be the showers that were a bit cold. All in all, was a wonderful place, very clean and with great staff as well, I recommend it. Virginie was a very warm welcoming hostess, she even offered us something for breakfast that we never expected but warmly appreciated. To add to this, she was very helpful when we sought advice on how to reach Versailles, giving us very specific guide on what subway/train to take. We reached Versailles without any problem. Her place is also surrounded by restaurants, eateries and near the mrt. You will not regret your stay in her house, highly recommended!! I don't expect luxury from a hostel, but I do expect cleanliness.  On the surface the hostel appears clean. Most importantly, the bed sheets and mattress are clean. However, look beyond that and you'll see it's filthy and obviously never given a deep clean. Down the side of the lower bunk there is what must be months and months of rotten food, old socks, dirt and dust that has been allowed to collect. No wonder the room smells so musty and stuffy. My bunk had blood streaks from a squashed bug (and live mosquitoes flying about), as well as sticky finger prints all over the bed panels and window.  Furthermore, the noise level is crazy. I understand on a Friday people want to party so the bar was blasting out music and the 1st floor rooms are not sound proof - I actually didn't Poor customer service, poor breakfast for the price, rooms extremely small, dirty, uncomfortable beds, no atmosphere but the bar. Not a nice location. Booked through Booking.com reading reviews and looking at pictures, but was a huge surprise and disappointment when arrived. Not clean bathrooms. Great place to stay in Paris, the staff are friendly. Also the rooms have lockers and curtains on the bed which is positive. Location of hostel is quite far out from ‘ attractions’ but there’s a metro station nearby so it doesn’t matter.  Book in advance for cheaper rates. The bed had a curtain and own lamp and power outlet, which made staying comfortable. There was a nice rooftop guests could go on, giving a nice view of the neighborhood. And a voucher for a small welcome drink was also nice. There was no common kitchen guests could use, but it was ok to eat outside food in the lobby. Overall, a good hostel and would recommend! The staff is friendly, the accommodations are comfortable (with the privacy of bed curtains), and it is a good environment to meet other travelers in. I am glad I stayed here. Also in a neighborhood that has good restaurants and bars, and close enough to get to the major Paris sites. The best hostel I ever stayed at. The beds are very comfortable, lockers are spacious. The showers were pretty clean. The atmosphere of the place and the incredible staff were definitely the best part though. I’ll definitely stay here again next time I’m in Paris. The staff is very friendly and the location is very close to metro stations. The area around the hostel has a lot of bars and restaurants. The A/C at my room was amazing during the hot weather of Paris . The lockers are too big to have big luggage.   What i didn't like there was one toilette only without any kind of ventilation at each floor which isn't suitable for all guests. The cleaning ladies entered the room while the people were sleeping to arrange it before the check out time. Stayed there for 3 nights and the bathrooms and beds are all pretty nice. The shower was one of our favorites of all the hostels we stayed in and the beds were decently comfortable with a nice amount of privacy with the curtain. The lockers and hooks in the room are also nice but beware that some of the beds have the outlet blocked due to a post. The downstairs bar area is nice and you get free welcome drinks to use at any time. As for the not so good stuff…all of the men that work there except Romeo are pretty much incompetent. The girls seem nice and knowledgeable as well but if you really need anything to get done talk with Romeo, he is the best. Everyone else pretty much really dropped the ball when it came to being of any help, especially the skater boy looking kid (you’ll Unfortunately I can't recommend this place. The bed was so uncomfortable that I woke up each morning with a back pain. I also don’t know who thought that building those beds like that would be a good idea - my legs were under someone's bed so I constantly kept kicking the wall while moving my legs. Every move shook all four connected beds. Also, doors on the whole floor were so massive and loud that walls of the room literally shook with every closing/opening which made it very hard to fall asleep at night. The AC was very loud. The bathroom could use some improvements - my cosmetics kept falling off the shelf in the shower and the mirrors above the sinks are hung at wrong height (made it hard to access the sink while washing my face etc.). On the bright sides - I was able to I only stayed for one night and have nothing to complain about, the room was clean and set up very well, toilets and showers are easy to reach and right around every corner is something interesting to discover - would come again! The room I was in had 3 others already there. It was a mess with their things everywhere when I arrived. The bathroom floor had water all over from the shower (only a curtain between the rest of the bathroom), so to even go to the toilet was impossible without getting feet wet. I had to go and ask staff for some spare towels to mop up the water. I was placed on a top bunk which was right next to the A/C unit which made weird noises on and off the whole night long. Okay - it's a hostel, it's not going to be perfect, and a large part of your experience depends on the other individuals in your room (i.e. up to chance). Sadly the people in my room were messy and incosiderate. The guy in the bunk next to me came crashing in at 2am, and when he got up in the night and early morning he I was so tired and jet-lagged when I checked in at The People that I felt like a drunk toddler. But the staff members were so kind and understanding - they went above and beyond during my stay. The shared bunk rooms and bathrooms were incredibly clean, and the location is conveniently located a block or two from the Belleville Metro stop. I would book another stay here in a heartbeat. The People - Paris Belleville Hostel is a good one. The bed is very comfortable and bathrooms are so clean and good. The rooms are new and clean. The people from reception are amazing. I really recommend it. me and my friend came to paris for three nights and decided to book a hostel. we were pleasantly surprised by democratic prices for such clean and well-maintained rooms (curtains for privacy, lots of sockets, storage space, lockers, AC) - same goes to shared bathrooms, they were pristine! drinks and food at the bar downstairs were not pricey at all. the staff members are absolutely lovely, and so are the people who were staying in! we even made some friends in our room and down at the bar.   one of the best parts of the hostel was probably the rooftop. with such stunning view, it’s a great spot to relax, have a beer and admire the sunset.   thanks to the personnel - laid-back and understanding,- you guys made our holiday experience even better :) The hostel was great. The location was super convenient, especially for metro access. The bar downstairs was a great feature, and made getting coffee in the morning so easy. The staff was super nice and friendly as well.   The rooms were great. We stayed in the rooftop dorm. The bed was comfortable, and the view from the roof was amazing. The rooms were really clean, and there was plenty of locker space. Its the cleanest hostel ive stayed in my lofe. People here are lovely and helpful. Without a doubt i ll be staying here again. The only thing is that its a bit far from downtown but you have a metro 5 min walking. The bets value for money! Thanks for helping me have a lovely stay in Paris! We had such a great stay at The People! The staff were so kind and welcoming, and extremely helpful when it came to accommodations and recommendations. The living space and bathrooms were clean, and I felt safe as a young female. Belleville is a bit out of the way from city centre, but I loved the little neighborhood and being farther back from the craziness of the tourist areas. Its a super quick walk to the metro which is VERY easy to use in paris! Would recommend this place to anyone looking for convenient and cheap accommodations I was staying in a room with six beds due to limited budget, so I can't really complain about the size, but the staff are all very nice and the facilities are clean and tidy, the rooftop and the location is wonderful!  The only regret is that I just kept two shopping bags in my room without locking them in the locker as it was too late to light up the room to do that and I don't want to wake all my flatmates, and in the following day the two shopping bags were simply gone. It remained in doubt whether this was stealing or not as I still had all my valuable.   As I reported to those staffs for a few times they all did express their sympathy for my loss, and they also tried to let me to check the room where their cleaners keep all the findings. As you can guess I could not find The bed and showers were excellent! Super comfortable, and clean. The staff was so kind, helpful, and patient. We especially loved the detail of the tile superheroes on the floor of the bar. One employee in particular, the man with a moustache, tried his very best to help us identify the superheroes. Even though he was wrong about Optimus Prime, that doesn’t change our view of the hostel as a whole. :)  1000000/10 would definitely stay again.   - Alison Argyle Great experience for us! My sister and I are traveling around and stopped in Paris for a couple of nights. We stayed in a four bed mixed dorm and everything looked great! We had a bedroom on the top floor, which was also the roof, and it was an amazing view! The metro was about a block away in either direction and very easy to use to get to anywhere needed including to the train station and the airport. The downstairs doubles as a bar which had comfy seats and activities going on every night. I had the second shortest bed (still a bottom bunk) and found it slightly difficult to get in, so if you have any physical impairment, I would definitely request the shortest bed (which from what I saw with one of our roommates, they were very happy to work with). Staff was helpful and Stayed 2 nights solo in mixed dorm. Had the 2nd lowest bed. Rooms are ok sized, not the smallest nor biggest. The lockers in the room were big enough for my humongus sized luggage + packbag. Toilet has a small smell, could be fixed with a freshener. Showers were wonderful. There is a hairdryer free of charge. There is air conditioning yet if u want to manage it you need to contact reception. First night my room was full and the air little funky but i think it was a smelly roomate. Reception isnt superfriendly. Welcomedrink is like 1 dl. Compared to other hostels the matress was little better than your avarage one so that and a good price might be bringing me back. I loved this place, it was just what I needed - I stayed in a 6 women dorm and it was clean, air conditioned and each bunk had a little curtain around it so frankly I felt like I had a bit of privacy! The shower was warm and pretty powerful. The lobby and bar area was friendly and always full of people. I came home about 4am and buzzed and someone opened the door. It also felt pretty safe as to enter the rooms area you needed a card to open the doors. Would definitely stay again. Les Piaules was an incredible place to stay. We were a young group of friends and the environment was perfect for our weekend. The hostel is very chic and comfortable, and they have a rooftop from which you can see the entire city. I would repeat 100%. Amazing hostel. Well located. Friendly and capable people. Open until late hours, arrived at 2am with no problems. Clean, hot shower. Didn't try the breakfast because I didn't want to, but lots of people were there. Nice atmosphere in the lobby I really enjoyed my stay at The People-Belleville. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the privacy curtains are a nice touch. The rooftop terrace is lovely and a perfect place to meet other travelers. The bar and patio downstairs were perfect also, and they have weekly live jazz music on Thursdays. The metro is only a few minutes walk away and connects you to the rest of Paris. I liked that this hostel is in a quieter area so you can sleep restfully. I would definitely return.\"},\n",

Conveniently located, welcoming and helpful staff, clean and comfortable rooms with nice high ceilings so even a basic room feels spacious. Amenities include the pool which almost feels like a Roman bath with its curved brick ceiling, a gym, afternoon tea, and option for a breakfast buffet. Would definitely stay here again. For our first trip to Paris, we chose to stay at the Hotel Square Louvois for almost two weeks in June/July 2023, mainly on a recommendation but also the many positive reviews.  Our booking for 2020 was cancelled, as were the next two bookings in 2021 and 2022 - all due to the pandemic, lockdowns in Melbourne and operational issues post Covid in the travel industry.  Also, our original booking was non-refundable, however, the hotel was kind enough to give us a credit which they continued to extend until we finally arrived this year, 3-1/2 years after making our first booking!  Along the way, I had the absolute pleasure of corresponding with My Hoan (Reservations) who never lost faith that we would eventually arrive in Paris.  In fact, she came in on her day off to welcome us to Ignore any bad reviews posted about this hotel. If someone gives this less than 5 stars then they are mad.   Really good value for money. Location is great around 10 minute walk from the Louvre. Some really good restaurants around locally. We ate in Orchard as well which I would recommend. Great Korenan food.  Rooms are modern and very nice. No street noise in our room at all. Beds were very comfy, slept really well.  If you do want some downtime in the hotel then they have multiple channels from all over the world on the TV. Spa downstairs with a swimming pool and gym. Only thing I would be slightly critical of is the pool is not heated. Breakfast is good, not amazing but good.  The best thing about the hotel is the staff. Every staff member was lovely and eager to go out of The Square Louvois was wonderful. Perfect location, Bus and Metro lines very close, and a staff that was so accommodating, kind, willing and eager to help first timers to Paris. Hotel was very much a boutique style, near to so many important landmarks. God willing we make it back very soon Disclaimer:Although a travel agent, I will always review based on a traveler perspective with customer service insight as I have lived both positions for a very long time. Customer service in conjunction with my experience as a customer is what drives my repeat business and recommendations to friends, family and clients.   Where do I begin with this place? This was a mother/daughter trip to celebrate my daughter's 16th birthday early that sent us across Europe, and of course Paris was on the list. I do want to add that my daughter is on the Autism Spectrum for context as I know this would be helpful for families or persons traveling with loved ones on the Spectrum as well. I was a bit worried at first as my French is not the greatest but I try and this seemed to be more of a Lovely stylish hotel with friendly staff and good facilities.  The pool in the cellar is beautiful and open 10am-10pm so a nice addition to our stay.  Breakfast was fresh and catered to all tastes.  When we arrived we found a bottle of champagne in our fridge, courtesy of the hotel, which was a lovely touch. The staff was great before we arrived (I had numerous questions) and during our stay. The breakfast buffet was lovely. The rooms were clean and elegant. And, only a short walk to the Louvre. There is a nice park across the street, too. It's the best hotel I have stayed at in Paris. We booked 3 nights in a Superior Double Room upon reading raving reviews on Tripadvisor and photos of the room. However, the room and especially the bathroom felt incredibly basic. We paid approx $600 AUD per night and the room was very small and the bathroom felt like a hospital bathroom. The amenities provided were not very nice smelling and half of the bathroom didn’t even have tiles making it feel very basic considering what we paid. The room set up and layout was also not the most thought through eg with only one full length mirror inside the closet and the only other mirror inside the bathroom, no USB cable charger port by the bed. Wouldn’t recommend for value for money This is a small(50 rooms)  but new and modern hotel. Well located, walking distance to louvre museum. A lot of shops and restaurants, accessible yo train and buses, Uber. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. Daily housekeeping, free bottled water. Has a nice warm indoor pool and small gym. We stayed in duplex (suite) , and it has a 2nd floor and a bathroom. So it seems like there’s 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, wood floors. Highly recommend! I loved our stay here. We celebrated our 10th year anniversary and the hotel made it so special for us.  The staff welcomed us and checked us in quickly, while waiting for our room to get ready we were offered refreshment. Our rooms were always spotlessly cleaned! Beds and pillows are comfortable. Kudos to your housekeeping team.  This hotel has AC which made our afternoon naps cozy. The sumptuous  breakfast spread is something to take advantage of, I mean, everything is offered in-house before you start your day. Sadly, we only ate a few times because  we needed to leave before 7 for our tour. 😂 The tea time in the afternoon is a nice touch, we enjoyed coming back and taking a quick nap after tea and head out again to explore the city more.  At the end of the day logging in Outstanding boutique hotel, friendly and welcoming staff, beautifully decorated rooms and public spaces, located on a fairly quiet street but with plenty of bistros nearby and within walking distance of the Louvre. Thank you to the staff for a wonderful experience. We’ll stay here again next time we’re in Paris and would definitely recommend. This is a lovely hotel, beautifully decorated. Not far from Palais Royal, the Tuilleries & Louvre. Centrally located but also quiet. Cannot say enough positive things about the staff who were helpful and welcoming. They happily chatted with me, despite my broken French, so that I could get some practice. Breakfast was delicious.  Beautiful hotel! The staff are so friendly and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble. Rooms were so clean and tidy and the shower facilities were lovely. The hotel is quiet at night and the beds are very comfortable. The hotel is located in a great area and has lots of local shops and amazing restaurants (villa donelli was a highlight for us). Amazing overall stay and I would highly recommend. This hotel is wonderful. The rooms are very comfortable; clean and dry. The AC works like a charm. The location is fantastic. The staff is amazing and the price is spot-on… That said, this hotel has something that NO OTHER HOTEL HAS: Melissa.   Melissa checked us in and has answered our questions, made recommendations and has accommodated our every need. Our entire party owes Melissa and her amazing team a huge “thank you” and a round of applause! All perfect, super service, welcoming room and pleasant and centric location.

My family of 5 (2 adults, 3 kids) stayed at the Hotel Square Louvois for a family trip to Paris in June 2023.  We reserved 2 adjoining rooms to accomodate our party of 5.  The rooms were very nice and the right size for our family.  We took advantage of the in room Nespresso machines and tea (all complimentary). The location was great.  A short walk to the Louvre and easy access to several Metro stops. We took advantage of the afternoon tea daily and the attendants were pleasant and helpful.  Our kids loved the pool and we used it in the evening after long days walking around Paris. On our last planned day, we were notified that our our return flight to the states was delayed to the following day and the front desk was able to quickly book us an additional night in the same 2 I can’t recommend the Square Louvois highly enough.  As beautiful and centrally located as the hotel is, it’s the amazing staff that makes this one of the best hotels in which I’ve ever stayed.  No one ever wants to experience a medical problem on vacation, especially in a foreign country.  Unfortunately I completely threw my back out stupidly carrying excess luggage in another part of France before arriving in Paris.  From the moment we arrived the front desk team was constantly attentive to my to my lame condition and ultimately arranged for a local physician to visit the hotel and administer care.  They also had the best recommendations for dinners, transit, touring.  All with a genuine and caring enthusiasm.  I don’t call out staff in TA reviews but the team here was Stayed here with some friends for our 40th celebrations. The hotel was lovely and clean. The rooms were clean and of a reasonable size. We had a view of the Eifel Tower in the distance from one of our windows. Breakfast was good. Water topped up in the room every day and treats left in the room. Staff were friendly. Pool was small but big enough to swim/float after a long day walking. Hotel was in a good location for either walking or getting the metro places and for places to eat. This was a lovely hotel to stay at.  The location was great - we walked to where we needed to go most days or to a very close metro stop.  There were great food and drink options nearby.  The hotel itself was very nice - everything was clean, well thought out.  The size of the room is what you will find in any major city, but very comfortable.  The staff was wonderful - always friendly and very helpful.  They helped to arrange a taxi for us to the airport and they saw it was one of our birthdays and left us some macarons and a small champagne as a treat.  We were also left a small bottle of champagne upon arrival.   We enjoyed the pool a couple of evenings as well.   They really put effort into a comfortable and pleasant stay for guests - we would absolutely stay here again Wonderful hotel!! Sweet boutique hotel in a great location. Walking distance to great restaurants, the Louvre and shopping. What really stands out is the staff - they were all outstanding! Very helpful and went above & beyond to make sure we were comfortable.  The the rooms are very clean and comfortable. Included are a coffee maker, mini bar and a split of champagne on arrival - so nice! Very nice buffet breakfast and tea served in late afternoon. A real find! Would definitely stay again! And an extra bonus - the hotel has a beautiful pool! Pros: - Friendly and helpful staff. - Good location with a few metro stops close by. It's never hard to get to where you're going. - Comfortable rooms and beds with great showers. We were on the 5th floor so it was very quiet. - Nice breakfast with cooked and continental options. - Close to lots of bars, restaurants and shopping areas.  Cons: - The glass partition on the shower could be a little larger to avoid splashes of water.  Wonderful stay at this clean and stylish hotel! The staff really made sure we felt welcomed and gave us Easter candy during the stay. Nice and clean rooms everyday and spacious. The rooms have minibar and coffee machine with supplements. The location is super with a lot of metro stations nearby and short walk to the Opera area. Would for sure come back to this hotel! We had a wonderful stay in Paris.  This hotel is ideally located for sightseeing.  The staff are very friendly and helpful, the rooms are spotless and the breakfast is great. All in all a wonderful find located centrally but away from the noise of the main boulevards.  The cellar swimming pool is great and an ideal place to relax after a busy day sightseeing. Right off the top, the staff at the Hotel Square Louvois (HSL) was amazing and treated us with nothing but great service and warm kindness. Everyone from the front desk, to the kitchen staff, to housekeeping were very accommodating and we have nothing but great things to say about them. The room we stayed in, St. Anne, was very cozy and comfortable enough for a family of four. Here’s a tip if you choose to stay here. The loft has a window that has a view of the Eiffel tower so at night you have a magical view of it. Breakfast service every morning from 6 to 11 am offers quite a lot with both hot and cold items. Tea time service daily from 3 to 6 pm allows you to unwind with a cup of tea or coffee with a few things to bite. Hotel design is chic with a flair for modern and We stayed here for 4 nights. It’s a lovely, smart, clean hotel in a good location. Despite the fact we stayed while the protests were ongoing, there wasn’t a great deal of noise at all. The afternoon tea is a really nice touch, as is the pool (although the temperature of this could be hotter!) The one thing that spoilt this stay, was an interaction with a staff member on our last night. On two of the nights, we had decided to eat in the hotel room (and when I say ‘eat’, I mean some baguette and cheese). So we went down to ask if we could have two plates and two knives. The first time this happened, the gentleman was more than happy to oblige, and perfectly polite. The second time, however, I met a different member of staff who we hadn’t seen before. Older, dressed slightly The Hotel is close to a Metro station not far from the Palais Garnier. We had opted for a Superior Room and were very happy with it. Very clean and contemporary in style, comfortable bed and pillows and well lit bathroom. Considering how close to the centre of the city it is, we found the Hotel quiet and were not bothered by traffic noise at all. If you need a pick up after being out sightseeing the complimentary afternoon tea hits the spot. We found all the staff helpful and efficient.  Wonderful hotel in the center of Paris.  Close to the Opera area and in the middle of the asian restaurant concentration.   The room was immaculate.  Staff was wonderful and they even offer a free afternoon tea with non-alcoholic drinks, cake and snacks.   Great hotel, great location. We stayed here for a romantic getaway from 30th Dec 2022 - 2nd Jan 2023.  The hotel is in a great location and within walking (or electric scootering distance) of most of the sights and attractions.  We stayed in the superior room on the 3rd floor which was great, the bed was super comfy which is always hit and miss when staying away.  They hotel also have a breakfast area in the lobby which they offer free teas / coffees and cake in the afternoon which was great.  The only small issue we had was the underground pool which was one of the main reasons for booking the hotel, it was not very warm so we couldn't stay in it too long. We stayed at the Hôtel Square Louvois during our New Year break. The hotel is fantastic in all possible ways - friendly and helpful staff, stylish, clean. Plus we enjoyed few small perks like afternoon tea and champagne. Thank you very much! My wife & I stayed at Hotel Square Louvois for seven nights to celebrate Christmas 2022. The hotel itself is tastefully designed and decorated, with decent-sized rooms (for Paris!) and a comfortable bed. We had an En Suite bathroom with a bath tub, and luxe slippers and robes. The breakfast is enjoyable and very fresh, and there is even the option to order breakfast in bed at no extra charge.   Now, what makes this hotel even better is its staff. From the first interaction, these guys went out of their way to make sure our stay was comfortable and memorable. On Christmas Day, we were given a complementary bottle of champagne, and throughout the stay they left thoughtful hand-written notes with chocolates, macarons, and to thank us for choosing their hotel.   The room service was What a great hotel. The staff was over the top nice. Every single one of them. Location was great. Room was clean and nice.   Went with 3 teen boys and the adjoining room was perfect in every way.   Close to metro walking distance to Louvre and dozens of restaurants. Firstly, worth stating that it was a fairly busy period when I was in Paris and all hotels were increasing their prices during at this time. This being said, given I had to pay over 500 EUR for the standard room, I didn't feel I got good value for money.  The rooms itself are rather small but nicely decorated. Even though I booked a king bed, I got two single beds put together (without a joint mattress protector) so it was quite inconvenient to sleep. There was also quite a bit of noise from the streets (my colleagues didn't seem to have this issue, so must depend on the room you are in).  The breakfast - that was not included in the room rate - was fairly basic.   Location was good.  Overall, for the right price this hotel would not be too bad, but given what I paid for the We stayed here for 3 nights and had the family suite. The rooms was exceptionally clean and beautifully decorated, the mini bar well stocked as well as complimentary drinks. Everything was immaculate BUT what made our stay even better was the staff especially Alix Chabot who went above and beyond to make our stay wonderful.   I was meant to stay here pre covid with my daughter but then covid hit. Alix was so accommodating in helping change our booking, we rebooked twice then sadly my daughter had an operation so yet again we had to change, no problem for Alix. Finally we came as a family and the communication from Alix and help was amazing, whatever she is paid double it as she is a real asset to this hotel. Thank you Alix and everyone else, we had the most amazing break in Phenomenal all around. I did a ton of mind-numbing research, as we are picky, but I wasn’t spending $1,500 / night for the top hotels. Staff were all amazing. Super friendly and helpful. Room was small compared to the US, but that is common in Paris. The closet with shelves and the area to hang clothes made it fine though. The pool is a super cool area and very unique. Hotel felt very clean at all times. Breakfast  looked very good. We never ate it as we were eager to explore each day. Free bottle of champagne delivered to our room upon check in was a very nice touch. Free tea time with snacks each evening was also another very nice surprise. I think my room was a slightly upgraded superior room. I HIGHLY recommend this place. Under $15 Uber ride to anywhere you need to go, and What a wonderful hotel. Ideal location, great facilities - beautiful pool, afternoon tea service and the staff are AMAZING, friendly and so helpful.  Never experienced service like this in central Paris.  Huge kudos to the whole team.  Brought my Mum for her 70th birthday and the reception organised a bottle of wine. Such a lovely touch.  Makes a huge difference to a stay when you are made to feel like this. Thank you. This hotel is very welcoming with a helpful staff that do their best  to help you to have a wonderful stay. The location is magic to visit what Paris has to offer (Louvres, Opéra Garnier…) and close to the Grands Boulevards as well. I enjoyed the pool as a plus, after a long day of visit. Special mention to Véronique, and the entire team for making my stay very speacial and pleasant What an absolute pleasure to spend a week in Paris at the Hôtel Louvois; so lovely, in fact, we extended our stay by 3 nights.  The staff were welcoming and accomodating.  Breakfast was worth every Euro and the dining room staff (thank you sweet Kia!) were friendly and helpful.  We had a quiet and immaculately clean room on the 2nd floor facing Rue Louvois.  The daily cleaning and turndown service was spot on.  Every request was accommodated from extending our stay to deliveries of ice.  Location in the Marais is unbeatable with proximity to top sites and metro.  Highest recommendation! Great location, helpful staff, nothing was too much trouble. The hotel room was small but you expect this in Paris. However, made great use of the space available, the whole hotel was clean and comfortable. Ideal for a place to rest your head and set off out into the city during the day. I stayed here for a week in July.  The staff are fabulous.  The rooms are stylish, super clean and have everything you need.  Great location and easy to reach all parts of Paris by either metro, taxi or walking.  The surrounding streets are full of restaurants and bars and there's a supermarket just two blocks up.  But the two best things about this hotel are Youssef and Veronique.  Their service leading up to my Covid-delayed-multiple-times trip was superb and finally meeting them in person was even better.  Thank you for making my stay so special.\"},\n",

Highly recommend  We\\'ve stayed here again! The prices are really good. We had rooms 2 and 3 which have a semi private balcony just outside! The rooms are clean and a good size for Paris. The bathroom is fairly small but the shower was a decent size and you get lots of hot water.  We drank in the lobby the first night and the wine was lovely.  We had breakfast a couple of days which was a mainly cold buffet but there was lots of it.   It is so easy to get to the subways and it wasn\\'t too expensive for Ubers. The area is quiet and the staff are so kind.  It is excellent value! My family and I stayed here for a week and we had an excellent time. The hotel is very clean and in a great location close to the metro. There are plenty of nice restaurants and bakeries nearby. The staff were very friendly and helpful during our stay and we found the breakfast to be very good value. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel if you are visiting Paris for a few days. This hotel is absolutely amazing for such a small property.  It\\'s clear to me that the owner takes personal pride in managing this place everyday.   Besides a minor mishap which got resolved quickly I really enjoyed the stay.  We are ultra clean when home and also when traveling.  We cannot believe this is a 2 star hotel.  If you value cleanliness, this hotel is a 5 star.  It shames many Park Hyatts and JW Marriott properties if you want a squeaky clean room and bath.   It\\'s simple and basic which is what we needed in the prime holiday season in June.  The air conditioning was strong, even too cold.  The location was also super convenient being close to 2 Metro stations.  Two constructive criticism on front desk issues.  1. The front desk could use an upgrade in appearance.  Wonderful staff available 24 hours and always ready to help. Location is very convenient with metro stations and RER very close. Not a tourist area, so lots of quality small shops, cafés and a large Printemps, plus a twice weekly market (food etc) and flea market close by. I stayed 9 nights (my second visit) and always felt safe, comfortable and at ease. Lovely lounge area to relax in in the evening (wine etc available on the premises), a simple but good buffet breakfast (organic produce). The hotel is very clean and the showers are as new. Beds are comfortable. I has stayed at this hotel with my family several times in  2008 and two years after when it was owned and managed by Mrs.Saliha Slimani where my family and me have good memories at Rothschild Hospital (close to the hotel) where my son went under successful operation. After 10-12 years, I stayed again at this hotel (27 Nov.). Same as before  cozy, quiet and clean with a nice breakfast in a small but well decorated and cozy lobby. Hotel has been renovated very well. Comparing to the price I paid, was fantastic. Staff good specially Melanie. We travelled to Paris for family holidays and I have to recommend this as the best choice made.  It is clean, quiet, close to train and metro stations, close to restaurants with variety of choices.  The rooms were cleaned every day, fresh towels when requested.  The staff is friendly and provide tips and recommendations.  We definitely stay again in this lovely hotel next time we get to visit Paris again! We have spent a night at Hotel du Printemps with a large group and it was just perfect. The hotel is easy to reach, the rooms were nicely furnished and everything was very clean. The staff was friendly and everything was to our complete satisfaction. The breakfast room is a bit small but the service was really quick in cleaning tables for new guests. The breakfast was much more than a typical french breakfast. We would definitely book there again. I booked this hotel because I was looking for an inexpensive hotel in Paris.  As long as you understand that it\\'s small, you\\'ll be more than happy.  The rooms are teeny tiny, but seem all very new, sparkling clean and well appointed.  We had a great view from our window, the front desk staff was very nice, and I\\'m more than satisfied with this hotel.  The bathroom was also new and sparkling clean.  Free wifi was not enough to stream any movies, but it worked well for checking email, etc. Great team, quick response, great room service Room clean, quiet place , following the covid 19 protection rules perfectly. I can say anymore except it’s gonna be my favorite hotel for my next trip. Thanks ! This boutique hotel is literally 1 minute walk from the metro station and few minutes walk from Nation area.   I really loved the warm atmosphere, the cleanliness of the room, the friendly staff and most important the delicious breakfast served in the room.   I really recommend if for short stays and business trips.   Nana  @forcedtowork_borntotravel  Nice hotel with friendly staff and renovated rooms. Very good value for money. A big plus for me was the parking deal they offered (garage parking for 15,- a day, which is a bargain in Paris). Would definitely recommend this place! Recently spent 9 nights at this hotel. This was a last-minute change from a planned Italian trip, so hadn\\'t done much research before booking. I was in room 11, a standard double/twin room. The hotel has clearly been recently renovated, and to my untrained eye tastefully so.  Room: by Parisian standards, larger than average. I could actually take 3 steps from end of bed to the bathroom entrance, which I have not been able to do in other Parisian hotels. Besides the bed, room had luggage rack, small desk, TV, and closet. There were plenty of electrical outlets. Wifi was fine--fast enough for a hotel and never dropped. TV had many non-French channels to choose from. My room faced the street, but there was effective sound-proofing so no street noise. You will here some internal I stayed in Paris for 4 days for a conference nearby the hotel. Though the hotel was booked for me by the conference organisers, the room was reserved via 3rd party.   The hotel is ideally located in zone 1 of Paris with the Metro station \"Nation\" around 650 meters away (well within walking distance). There are numerous eateries nearby but these seemed a bit overprice for the quality of the food they served.  The hotel room I was given was a twin single bed room, it was a bit on the small side but the spaces within the room was well utilised. The room had a wet room walk-in shower. TV had a wide range of international channels, and WiFi was free with the hotel room booking.   The breakfast costs 9.90 euros and to be honest is not worth paying for. It is you usual continental I love everything about this hotel. The staff, and at breakfast are so helpful and friendly! The breakfasts. The power shower. The coffee machine. The clean rooms. The neighbourhood. Picotin is our favourite restaurant - highly recommend their burger. The hotel is only 15 mins from Gare Du Nord on the RER so really easy to get around. We had a great time here in two adjacent rooms.  Spotlessly clean, pretty rooms with windows that open, and well serviced every day.  I was a little concerned 12th might be out of the way, but the neighbourhood was comfortable to walk around in the evening with lots of choices for dinner.  Great access to Nation so transport to both central sights and Disneyland very easy.  Franprix and Pharmacie couple of minutes away for general grocery, medicine items.  Very friendly reception staff available 24 hrs, happy to let us practice our French, themselves having great English and practical advice on how to get around during the strike.  Pretty church nearby and many interesting shops.  Enjoyed our stay here.   Lovely location in a lovely neighborhood not over-populated with tourists and close to the station. The rooms were very clean and well maintained but not so big. The breakfast was a very good large spread. I recommend. This was a good base; Nation and Picpus were convenient, and it was easy to reach from CDG RER  (but pre-arrival, check the map carefully; the streets aren’t as simple as they look on the map)  Staff were helpful, beds good, room good, breakfast very good; overall good value  The restaurants nearby are a good match for the hotel. It was good to be in a neighbourhood, one that isn\\'t dominated by tourism.  Recommended. While the rooms are quite small... they are clean and nicely decorated. My window looks out onto a canopy of trees and a row of beautiful historic buildings. The hotel is very close to “Nation” and “Picpus” metro stations which is very convenient. There are many grocery stores and restaurants in this area. It is fairly residential so not touristy at all. The staff are very helpful and there is a nice breakfast. I will likely stay here again sometime. Clean, comfortable and welcoming, but more importantly - very well placed! There\\'s easy access to the metro and the trains, making it simple to get to Disneyland, the Eiffel Tower or pretty much anywhere in Paris.   The breakfast was a really nice spread and the staff were very friendly. The room was quite small, but we didn\\'t really spend much time there and the bed was very comfortable.   There are lots of bars and restaurants around if you want to explore locally. Comfortable, modern hotel in a quiet area with good transport connections nearby. Room very comfortable if a bit small, as was the shower room. Pleasant staff. Excellent breakfast. Thoroughly recommended. Stayed here for 3 nights end of September. Loved this hotel!!   The rooms are small compared to North American standards but didn’t bother us. The rooms are super clean, nice decor, modern bathroom. Nice hot showers. Comfy beds and great wifi.   The staff were very friendly both day and night staff and kitchen staff. Spoke great english, as our french is terrible, and they gave us advice on how to get to certain locations.   The street the hotel is located on is very quiet. And has a very wide sidewalk meaning the cars are further from the buildings. Didn’t hear any street noise what so ever in our room. Very close to the Metro and many places to eat close by. Lovely bakery on the corner with amazing baguettes.   Staying in this part of the city was a little far from the Eiffel Clean rooms, very nice staff.  Close to the Metro.   Beds were comfortable and the rooms nicely decorated.  Located in a nice neighborhood with tree lined streets.  I would definitely stay there again amd recommend it to everyone. I stayed here with my wife and 6 year old son.  We stayed for 3 days, checked-out and went to Disney and then came back for another 3 days.   The good  1. The location is good. 10 minutes walk from Nation station, which is reasonably near Disney and La Vallee outlet.  2. It\\'s clean and the staff are kind.  3. The air-conditioning works beautifully.   The bad.  1. There is no refrigerator in the room. Though they do give you ice if you ask for it at the front desk.  2. On the first stay, I stayed in a triple room. When we were leaving, I told them that we would come back, and the front desk confirmed this. They said, you used the upgrade to adjacent rooms. I said, That\\'s strange, my Hotels.com says it\\'s one room. The front desk again said, but it\\'s two rooms, next to one another.  very nice hotel. Modern room, very clean. Good location and air-conditioned! The breakfast was decent, soft or hard-boiled eggs, cereal, coffee, [cappuccino, etc.] Orange juice, yogurt, etc.  I would use it again. The Hotel du Printemps is a great value given the convenient location in Paris.  It is a few blocks to the Arch and subways there will take you anywhere in the city..  Great restaurants and shopping around the area and you don\\'t get gouged like in the more central touristy areas.  Expect smaller rooms typical of most older Europeiean cities.  Micro showers... I am not a big person and I kept turning the water off when I turned around in the shower...  Also minimal toiletries.  The breakfast was nice and has everything you might want to start the day, including a personal pot of coffee.  The staff was exceptional.  Friendly, helpful and very professional.    One note-  Stairs are at the entry.  Anyone with limited mobility should probably NOT stay at this hotel. Prior to booking our Paris hotel, I did A LOT of research on TA, reading dozens of reviews. I kept coming back to Hotel du Printemps as my top choice and I have zero regrets that this was our hotel for 6 nights. In fact, staying in this lovely hotel in this very quiet French neighborhood in the 12th arrondissement was a highlight of our trip! Even though this hotel is not in central Paris (which turned out to be a benefit), taking the metro to where we wanted to go was never more than 15-20 minutes and frankly was part of what made the experience fun, especially for our two teenagers who enjoyed figuring out the metro system and became our leaders every time we went somewhere. More importantly, I knew that after busy days of touristing, we would need a comfortable and quiet My boyfriend and I recently stayed at this hotel for four nights and we had no complaints! We arrived early in the morning after our flight hoping to just drop off our bags and it was a pleasant surprise that our room was ready ahead of schedule!  The room was quite small but that is to be expected in Europe so that was not an issue. It was cozy and very clean. The location is absolutely wonderful, being near many great restaurants (try Le Cosy and Nona Rita!) and a quick walk to two metro stations.  The breakfast each day was very tasty as well! Affordable, great location, nice service. Rooms are small but comfortable and clean. Nice modern, updated bathroom.  I would most definitely stay again. Being close to transportation and food options was a plus. Visit Le Cosy nearby and order the burger and risotto, butternut squash  and scallops dish! Good location near Nation, a major transport hub, in a nice, tranquil neighbourhood. Staff really friendly and helpful. Spotlessly clean, comfortable bed, good heating/air conditioning, strong WiFi, good TV channels, good breakfast. Best place one could stay at in Paris! Amazing warm hospitality, cozy rooms, lovely breakfast well connected to metro Picpus and nation, and buses.. Didn\\'t have transport problem even when we came back very late at night around 12. The staff make you feel so welcome and comfortable.   the shower, beds and room amenities were excellent! Like home away from home ! Highly recommend for both long and short stays! Lots of good eateries and supermarkets nearby as well. The neighborhood is very pretty too.the breakfast in hotel is lovely. Happy that we chose this place, made our visit memorable. We stayed here last October. We’re a family of four and the triple room was perfect for us. Comfortable, clean, well equipped! Market, patisserie, pharmacy, and METRO were located within 5 minutes walking distance. The front desk staff were excellent, friendly,and helpful with directions. We’re planning on going back to Paris this fall and will definitely stay at Hotel du Printemps again. A short walk away from Nation station where the Metro and RER are. You can find plenty of bakeries and express supermarkets around the area. There\\'s even a wet market on the weekend! The room is small but it is good enough if you dont have a XXL luggage each and the night staff was fantastic. The weather was cold and kettle was not provided in the room but that\\'s perfectly fine because the receptionist was very willing to help us prepare some hot water every single night we stayed. The only hiccup for my room was a sudden blackout in the morning. We weren\\'t sure why but the building\\'s electricity was working fine. Fortunately it was on our last day of the stay. Only stayed at this hotel for a quick two nights, after we left another hotel we were not happy with (separate point). We found this one online kind of last minute and it did the trick at the moment. Positives are the location, the staff are very fast and professional with all requests, and the entire stay had no hiccups. Negatives are the room was smaller than we would have preferred, but oh well. Free wifi worked well and was free, the concierge was helpful, and we enjoyed the breakfast. We had a wonderful time in du Printemps, the room was super clean, the staff were very attentive, breakfast was just great. The location was very easy to get around of the city center. We definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. I loved everything about this hotel, It is charming and comfortable and clean. I also love the location. It is near two metro stations and the neighborhood is quiet. There are a variety of restaurants (Italian, Chinese, Japanese restaurants, etc) and stores (grocery, pharmacy, bakery, etc) near the hotel.   The staff were also very helpful. Overall, my stay here was incredibly wonderful (I only wish though they had a laundry facility). And when I visit Paris again in the future, I would surely pick this hotel again. We had a great stay at hotel du printemps. The service, the staff, the room, the food... Definitely returning on our next trip to Paris. The room had a private bathroom with great quality regarding shower pressure and temperature. It was also very clean. The room was spacious enough, had a functioning TV, a very comfortable bed and a nice overall temperature.  A great surprise was their ecological concern: all napkins and tablecloths were recycled paper, the food served on the breakfast was all organic, even the shampoos were bio.  The breakfast was very good, having croissants, various types of bread, cheeses and hams, eggs, fruit purees, little delicious pains au chocolat... The coofee was also very tasty (rly important to me 😂).  We chose this specific location because Great location for getting in and out of the city. Small rooms but that’s paris. Breakfast was fairly good value and tasty. Cosy reception area. Bathroom was clean and modern. Free use of umbrellas which was useful for bad weather we had during our stay. Would highly recommend.  My wife and I spent 16 days at this facility in late Sept. We loved it! The staff suggested sites not mentioned in the guidebooks. Nearby restaurants treated us like old friends. The optional breakfast was a good value. The housekeepers kept our room immaculate. The room was small,but very quiet and comfortable. The neighborhood is safe- day or night. The nearby marketplace at Nation Place was very interesting. We took buses and metro trains everywhere we wanted to go. We easily took trains to the Palace of Versailles. We definitely recommend this hotel. Upon entry into my single room, my first though \"omg, this room is tiny\".  The single room i stayed in was EXTREMELY small.  Smaller than the room pictured on the site.  I assume this is because I was given the corner room, by the staircase which was arranged differently to accommodate the location.  Once I got over the room,  I figured I need to just accept it.  However, the next morning, I was awakened by noise in the roof, (I was on the 5th floor).  I called downstairs and they said that the guys were in the attic,  conveniently located above my roof, working.  Then the front desk called me a few minutes after and suggested I came downstairs and spend about 10 minutes in the lobby because they will be setting off the fire alarm and it would be better for me to not be in the'},\n",

We worried Firstly it’s a hostel so there are multiple people to a room and it can be noisy. This should be expected.   St Christopher’s i found to be  perfectly clean and the inclusion of a bar on the ground level is convenient for a beer when you get back. There are multiple screens showing sport which when j was there includes football and NFL  Each bed is allocated a metal cage to keep your belongings during the day and in the basement are lockers that can be used after checking out.   There is an option to add continental breakfast which is highly recommend. I opted for this and set myself up well until mid afternoon.  Lastly the location is slightly further out than some but is within 10 mins of the metro. If you are used to walking around cities this should pose no problem at all.  Visited St christophers Inn Paris, lovely efficient, clean and comfortable. Along side is belushis bar.also  known as beds and bars.Last Saturday evening we were excited to watch the rugby world cup and soak up the local atmosphere.  I sat at a table reserved, so moved to another, this too was reserved, so I moved again to a table with no reservation. After one drink, my partner joined me. Along came another 3 people who sat at the same table. All of a sudden a man came up and directed his conversation at me. He said he wants the table I am sitting on,  as he has a NICE family of six. He will show me another table I can use. I said I did not want to move as this was the third time. He then became most irate and  said he wanted the table, I asked him why he was just asking me and AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Bad service, elevator still doesn’t work. Drunks and drug addicts bring the noise and the down-and-out ambiance. Tijuana atmosphere from the guests to the trashy end of the road feel including the receptionists (who don’t speak French or have customer service training) and the club downstairs. If you have an ounce of self-respect avoid this heartbreak habitat. Save up for something nice. Treat yourself to a real accommodation. Overall, it\\'s an ok hostel.  Decent breakfast for an alright price. The evening activities to get people talking and involved is a great idea and it works.  Staff are friendly.  Rooms are hot, no air conditioning. The door handle on our room was finicky, but once you got the hang of it, it was fine.  It\\'s in an ok spot I recently had a highly disappointing experience with St Christopher\\'s Inn Paris - Canal, which compelled me to share my feedback. After booking a stay with the hotel, circumstances changed, and I promptly requested a cancellation and refund within 24 hours, in full compliance with consumer protection laws.  Unfortunately, the response I received was far from satisfactory: the hotel proceeded to cancel my reservation without issuing a refund. This decision not only contradicted the regulations set forth to protect consumers, but it also left me feeling deceived and frustrated. The lack of transparency and failure to honor the refund rightfully due to me was deeply disappointing.  Moreover, the hotel\\'s refusal to provide a clear explanation for their actions only exacerbated my I was solo traveling and had the best time there, they have free social events every night and it was perfect for meeting people! I stayed for 4 nights spent my days and nights with the amazing people I met! Dosent have a kitchen which is a bit annoying and I was on the fifth floor. other than that, awesome! This hostel is fantastic! All of the staff have been amazing, very friendly and professional, lots of fun, and very helpful. Particularly Lys at reception, and this one very kind security guard who’s name I believe was Momo. Lys was super cool and made the stay that much nicer. Momo rescued us from some sketchy characters who were bothering us outside the hostel late at night, and he was really funny. The other reception staff were also super cool but I don’t have any of their names. It was just a great time, the facility was very nice, the hangout room was perfect, the social events were awesome including the night club downstairs. Also, despite the odd people you tend to encounter at night in any big city, the area seemed relatively safe. My friend I made here has stayed in 8 Hello 👋! It was okay in general, apart there was no locker nor fridge and also no plug-in in my bed. Guests and hosts were nice but not as friendly as in the UK \"ST. CHRISTOPHER INN FOR YOUTH\" in Scotland, Edinburgh 🇬🇧 👀 😇. I forgot to add there was no lift / elevator ...! One advantage was the location near the metro 🚇.   AVOID AVOID this place AT ALL COST! THIS PLACE IS DANGEROUS! In the middle of my sleep one of the receptionists pulled me out of my bed aggressively all of a sudden I was then severely mistreated for 18 hours by authorities, the staff then destroyed my new suitcase, they damaged my computer, stole my bankcards, among other important things, then they refused to give me my money back from my rent money that I paid for a few days, it was my last money for the months, I was then on the ice cold streets in Paris not knowing where to sleep! Until today I don t know why I was aggressed while I was sleeping I didn t do anything wrong at all and why my important belongings were intentionally destroyed and stolen! As a foreigner without bank cards in a foreign country I couldn t get then Worst hostel I\\'ve been.  Shower drain is blocked, so you better like having your feet in the water of the previous person that just showered. Toilet was a bit dirty, Pillow sheet torned, Blanked torned, noisy bed, broken locker. Asked the service to use another bed(in order to get a functioning locker) , but apparently, it was already reserved, 2days later the other bed was still available. People going there are a little too party type.   Beautiful spot but not very practical for transportation. You have to walk a bit. My friend and I were excited to stay here after seen all the good reviews but we were quickly disappointed. All 4 nights we stayed, we couldn’t sleep more than 3-4 hrs because it was very noisy even at 4am. Every single day people gathered outside the hostile and made so much noise.  Not getting adequate sleep ruined our 4 day stay in Paris since we were always tired and didn’t want to return to the hostile. The bathrooms were dirty and the beds uncomfortable. Reconsider staying here if u want to rest and enjoy ur stay in Paris. I do not recommend this hostile. A perfect place to stay when you travel alone. Cheap, clean, safe. It seems like there is a lot of other \"alone travelers\" here. Its also a resturant with a nice place to sit outside nearby the river. It seems like a social, relaxed place,  but also a place where you perfektly can sit alone. Really liked this place! Recomenned! The staff is also very helpful,  and gives good service. And ofc: Its Paris! I love Paris. The staff were friendly and the food in the bar delicious but some major problems at this hostel and will not be revisiting. We’ve stayed a dozens of hostels, a fair few St Christophers also. This one was far below standard.   Cleanliness: - Showers grotty. Walls weren’t wiped during out entire stay with mud streaks and hair stuck to them.  - Signs everywhere advertising ‘cleaners on site 18 hours a day’ while it took them over 12 hours to mop up vomit in the hallway that has been reported numerous times. Even then, it wasn’t cleaned up properly.   Communal Spaces: - Access to the communal spaces was limited due to the chill out area being the home to over 10 trolleys of dirty bedding leaving slim room for guests.  - The bar advertised as being included with the hostel was Being 40, I felt really old going to a hostel but the double I got on the 6th floor was great, with a fabulous balcony overlooking a kids playground and the canal close by. This is a very cute part of Paris and only ten minutes in a cab to Gare du Nord. The reason I’ve not given 5* is because the shower flooded the bathroom making it a bit of a slip risk but the front desk staff were brilliant and couldn’t do enough to help, even with the most basic of questions. Everyone I encountered working there was friendly, helpful and generous. Between that and a couple of great local restaurants close by this is a gem. Stayed here on an interrailing trip with my Fiancé. Really enjoyed our stay. There is a metro stop a couple of minutes down the road, despite the hostel not being central it didn’t matter. The room was spacious, bathrooms good and staff friendly, breakfast was okay and the food in the bar was lovely.  Main issue was the window was either fully open or not and as it was on a balcony on the Main Street we didn’t want to sleep with it open to the public so it was very hot! Also kind of annoying having people come in late/talk in the hall but I guess it comes with the territory. This was our first hostel we stayed in during our Europe backpacking trip and after experiencing what other hostels have to offer, I can say this was the worst of the bunch. There is a bar underneath the rooms which is nice but the rooms were dirty, smelly, the windows were locked shut, and filled with high schoolers who were obviously just looking for a place to hookup.   There are too many hostels in Europe to justify staying here. First of all, the moment I got into the reception Kira and Ashley were so welcoming. The bed was really comfortable, breakfast was great, and the night club just awesome. I had just a little problem with the plugging charger of my litter but they solved it right away. Thanks again for everything! Amazing. The staff Pedro was very kind with us. The breakfast was good. The bedroom was cozy. The location by the river is pretty good and its very close from the metro station.   The place has a bar, a little bit expensive but with very good food Barry is the sexiest bartender alive i love this man. great hotel wish i knew my hostel mates but still had a great time. try to spend as little time at the hostel as possible and spend more time around the city. still writing to meet the 200 character minimum requirement Overall a very good hostel experience, staff encourage guests to engage with each other by organising free hostel events every evening. Pedro was really nice and helped us meet other guests.  Rooms are OK. They are very basic but as prices are cheap they are still value for money. This was a pleasant stay. Very economical and worthwhile stay. The staff speak English so it was easy to engage them, and get help with local attractions. Reasonable Drink and food prices in the attached bar. It’s a fairly standard hostel, multiple bunks in my room (4). They need to do a better job with lockers, the lockers are quite small (9’ x 20’). This means you can only lock up some of your stuff. They don’t have locks, or power adapters for rent/sale, so make sure you bring your own. The lockers in our room were broken, would be nice if they were fixed.  The room was clean and it seemed to be very new. I payed 20€/night inclusive breakfast. Downstairs was a nice lounge where i could study and at night people where enjoying the enclosed bar and also other bars to go out where around. Target group is probably 20-30 y.o.  They also offered a free walking tour, good wifi and reduced prices at the bar. The breakfast was modest, but they had cornflakes, and mini-baguettes so I was satisfied. The location is close to metro stations, but to walk it\\'s a bit far from the city centre. However, I would recommend to stay there. HI, the vibe of this hostel is IMMACULATE, simply splendid! I’ve been her a day, and I’m already having the time of my life:’) Also, if you need a make-your-own-  mojito class teacher, LOOK FOR BARRY, he’s funsies️!!! Had a great time at St Christopher\\'s. The prices in Belushi bar. Especially Barry the Irish bartende! He was friendly and charismatic and very forgiving of my terrible french!! I would 100% visit again if and when I return to Paris; As an Irish person in Paris meeting Barry from Collig behind the bar really made me feel at home and his  hospitality was outstanding couldn’t have asked for anymore, I would definitely recommend this hostel and Barry behind the bar if your Irish! The accomodation is exactly what you’d expect from a good hostel, everything is clean, relatively spacious, good wifi etc. The staff are all very helpful. The bar is definitely the best part of the place, lots of like-minded travellers hanging out, perfect place to start a night out. The bar staff are really great too, special shoutout to Barry, who was always helping introduce me to new people! Overall, ill definitely be back on my next trip to Paris :) The place is very nice,a bit big for a hostel,not like all the small tiny hostels people are used to,location is wonderful by the canal,close to everyting and the metro,pity though with this covid thing they had to close the downstairs pub and restaurant yesterday.  nice place,great location,nice staff at the bar and security but an incredible number of problems during my stay.no shower in my private suite,no lift with 6 floors,no water during 2 days, room \\'s door who doesnt close,too many problems thats a shame.they gave me a 40 euros refund for that. A clean, well organised, quiet and very very cheap hostel, about 30 min from the city centre with the metro (which is not much, considering the size of Paris). The breakfast is included if you book on their website and they have a very nice bar/pub at the ground floor. The neighbourhood is quite calm and for what I have seen not dangerous. The common bathrooms are clean and there are many. I would definitely recommend it for groups of friends that are planning a cheap but nice weekend in Paris! COVID WARNING ! Some latin staff  tend to allocate people of colour, regardless of attitude, in the same rooms than economically deprivated people, sometimes with doubtful hygiene and without respecting the allocation of bunkbeds with reasonable distance. The french managers are much more inclusive and dont base their decision on skin colour only.  Be careful if you care not catching covid positive. Had to wear a mask within a space I was paying for which ruined the experience, staff enforced this rudely and without using common sense. Having paid for a place to stay I would\\'ve thought I would have the basic human right to breathe freely and not be harassed simply for entering without a mask. Perfect place to stay. It was very clean and calm. The staff were friendly and the food quality was almost good. The restaurant had a discount for the people staying in the hotel. Sitting near the river and drinking and talking with friends was amazing during night  Attention should be given to the steps on entry and exit to the building by the front door. No drinks should be taken beyond the steps unless the adequate seating and table facilities have been provided. Care should be taken at all times on entry and exit of the St Christopher Hostel I got my bag stolen at the hostel and told the reception about it when I left, in case they find it back at some point. They called me on the same evening to tell me that they found it. I called them back on the next day, to inform them that a friend of mine would pick it up.When my friend came, they told him that they threw the bag away...Then I called them everyday, always getting the same answer \"sorry but I don\\'t personally\\xa0know about this issue, please call back tomorrow\", until I finally got an email address\\xa0to which\\xa0I had to write (of course, two times...), to get the following answer \" since you didn\\'t respond to our message, we threw the bag away\". I find it extremely dishonest and irespectul. I’ve stayed at St Christopher Inn Canal in Paris in August 2020. It’s not far from metro and and attractions are easily reached. Views of the Canal are beautiful and morning coffee at downstairs bar terrace is a pleasant start to a busy day.. My room was clean, had towels changed and bathroom cleaned daily. All the precautions for Covid-19 are implemented. Hand sanitation stations are plenty,. Wearing face mask in downstairs premises is compulsory: bar, reception, cleaning team and security are wearing face covering at all times. The crew is very friendly and helpful, will go an extra mile to make sure they deliver excellent service. Now, the only drawback is that there’s no small fridge in private  en-suite rooms which is a complete disappointment. Usually August in Paris have Super histle, very Clean, friendly and helping stuff, with a bar with TV, soccer, hamburgers and other stuff, renting knives etc, whatever you wish, positive people and stuff, great location near the river, where at the evenening people come and sit and enjoy the day/evening, nearby Velib rent-a-bikes 50m from entry of hostel, Metro about 300k, restaurants nearby, also stores, bakery, swimming in Siena River 300m away, piecefully inside, busy and fun outside, since many bars by the river around, also pretty near all parts of Paris that are important. Inside smart offers for whatever person needs, forgot a towel-borrow one, same with locker, sleepers, etc., a hostel that is being Developed according to the peoples needs, would highly recommend it! Thanks for a Gr8 stay and fun Good size bedrooms with powerpoints, cutains, comfortable beds and cleaned every day. Bathrooms could be tidied up. Breakfast tasty. Good security. Friendly helpful staff. Location interesting, metro not far away. It was fine, the tables were sticky (not just some, literally all of the tables were sticky and all the time) and it was pretty expansive.. But the rest was OK i guess. Good connection to the city also. I really liked the hotel and the staffs are super friendly and speak a lot of languages so the communication is easy. the room was very clean the only thing that i didn\\'t like is that there is not toiletry in like shampoo ...

The staff were cool and helpful, no complaints there. But breakfast? Not exactly blowing my mind.

Now, if you\\'re all about drinking, partying, and pulling all-nighters, this spot\\'s a winner. It\\'s like they\\'ve planted themselves right in the heart of the party scene. So, if you\\'re down for some lively chaos and don\\'t mind the lack of solo-friendly vibes, it\\'s a pretty banging location for the night owl in you. Rude staff and dirty rooms. There are better hostels for this price..   only good thing is the location close to Gare du Nord of you are arriving by train. i\\'ll never come here again. Would absolutely not recommend I love the convenience of this place. The staff are wonderful and helpful. I found it very clean. It\\'s very busy, and you can meet all kinds of people here. The people here care, and they go out of their way to make your stay great. Thank you Emilinia and Mikaël!!! We had accidentally booked a female only dorm, and there were no beds available in male dorms, but they made everything right. Clean rooms, safe feeling hostel… Coming back here again I will never go back there! Poor room, dirty, the bunk beds are so old, the mattress are thin and so annoying, showers are annoying as well, you have to push it a lot to take a shower.  It was 35 degrees in Franch when I was there and they don’t have air conditioner. I asked a staff if they had a fan because the room was so hot and impossible to get sleep and he was rude and said that if it wasn’t there means that they didn’t have, he also said that the price was cheaper because that, and the next year the price will be increase because they will put air conditioner in all rooms. Actually the price isn’t cheaper as he said, I’ve seen better prices but I chose they because of the brand, but I regretted it.  Special mention to Roman who is so welcoming and was pure sound, would recommend staying here just to meet him. Absolute gem. Also room was v comfy has curtains on the beds for privacy. All very clean and food was soooooooo nice Best hostel ! I definitely will come back! Barry thank you for being so warm and welcoming with us! They welcomed us with an apero and everyone is so nice! It’s closed to the train station and it’s very closed to the center   Let\\'s start with the worst offender. The temperature. There are 2 Windows in a 6 bed dorm. Great. But only one opens while the other one is screwed shut, and the one that opens only does about 6cm. Meaning the only way to air out the room is to leave the door open and pray that the air somehow starts circulating. The pillows and blankets have disgusting yellow spots. There was a huge dead bug when we came here. Some power outlets don\\'t have a cover. The bathroom is REALLY TINY (I am claustrophobic so that\\'s always fun) like tinier than what you might get in a camper van. The bathroom also makes weird sounds permanently to keep you awake at night. In conclusion, in winter this might be ok for the cheap price, but in summer, do yourself the favour, book a more expensive hotel with I went for food and drinks every night. I had a great time each night. I found the food and drinks to be great. Barry and the rest of the staff are super friendly and very helpful and welcoming.  I wait to go back. The courtyard lobby was designed as a tin can and it also smells like one. The staff at the hotel are super nice; I can only feel sorry for them. I also don\\'t think it is healthy for them. It also must be noted that the architect for this place thought that a tiny lobby for a 20-some-story hotel make sense. You enter a claustrophobic space if you are lucky because they have double doors that require you to wait for the reception to open. The Bonvoy app promises quick check-in, which couldn\\'t be farther from the truth.  Our room never got move to ready on the app, and when we tried to use the key on our phone, we were locked out of our room. Check out work, though, so that\\'s good news. I asked support if it would be possible to modify my booking. I had booked a non-refundable but was willing to pay more for a modification and asked if it was possible. They said no which was fine but then canceled my booking and did not confirm it with me or anything. Support is completely inept. The location is perfect near Gare du Nord Hôtel is for night life   Room are mix with men\\'s and women  Toilettes no housekeeping All shift  The bar ground floor is good music and expensive alcohol drinks The breakfast is very poor just very basic  Good atmosphere for youngers to discover each other with cosy equipment I\\'m réception area  The bar staff and security are fantastic. My friend and I got unwanted and aggressive attention in the bar area and it was dealt with immediately. I felt very safe and it is far better protection than I’ve had at any bars/clubs before. Thank you to the lovely bar lady that I spoke to (tall) and the security staff that helped.   Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a cheap place to stay. Totally useless. Noisy, warm dormitory. Impossible to sleep. Expensive with poor facilities. I was there for one night in April. It looked nice on the pictures but the reality is nothing like it. There are no real lockers for your valuables and the dormitory was busy with people moving in and out and turning on the light in the ceiling all night long. Useless. In addition, there was an American booking site that pretended to be the establishment. Its just that when doing the reservation they added a surcharge which was not visible when they advertised the rate of the room. Only seen in the amount deducted from the credit card. Stay far away from this place if you can. I had a terrible experience at St Christopher\\'s in Paris, where the safety and security measures were severely lacking. During my stay, there was a violent incident in my room, and the management did not take any immediate action to address the situation.  Furthermore, the visibly distressed and openly violent individual involved was allowed to use drugs and return to the hostel without any intervention from the staff!  The situation escalated to the point of threatening violence towards everyone in the room, with some of us being able to escape, and others trapped in our bunks.  We had to contact the Paris police ourselves to ensure our safety, which was a traumatizing experience, particularly when a team had to break into the room, with guns and tasers.  Despite the severity St Christopher’s Inn,GdN.Paris. Located 200 mtrs from the Gare du Nord,is a large fun hostel based on 6 floors.

Excellent location only a few minutes from Gare du Nord. Rooms really clean and staff helpful. Belushi’s Bar on ground floor really good atmosphere, but consequently very loud until 12/1 ish. Most of our group were unable to get any sleep until the music stopped so bear this in mind if booking. AWFUL DOES NOT EVEN COVER IT. We arrived and checked into our room and immediately noticed a huge blood splatter on the bathroom wall, and blood on the bed frame. We went to reception and reported the issue, we did not receive an apology but were offered another room. When we went back to the original (blood splattered) room to collect our bags, a cleaner was in the room and she wiped the blood with a DRY towel, no cleaning spray or antibacterial anything. We went to our replacement room to find dried vomit on the toilet seat and a hair which looked extremely pubic on the top bunk bed. We checked out of the hostel 2 hours after arriving for fear of catching diseases - we again did not receive an apology or an offer of a refund from the front desk. Apologies if the attached I have booked for night for £27 but they added all of thing that cost me £98. the staff behaviour is so rude. it was worst experience I have ever. I cancel the booking my money was not refunded at the same time i booked another hotel cheaper, good service. I strongly recommend to not book this one When we checked in on a Friday night, the receptionist told us that our room was on the 2nd floor and handed us 4 sets of ear plugs with our keys. Turns out our room faces a courtyard that is part of the bar downstairs. When we got to the room, we understood the need for the ear plugs. The noise/music was bad/loud enough when the 2 person band was playing but got even worse after the band left and the bar only played music. Ear plugs do nothing for the pounding bass from the music, and the bar plays music until 2AM. If you\\'re going to put us in this crappy room at least adjust the rates you charge for it. The room itself was okay except for the large hole in the floor that was covered by the vinyl planking. The only good things about our stay were the nice staff at the front Horrible don’t come here. Beds didn’t have bedding when my friend and I arrived. We asked for replacements twice and still nothing, waited 2 hours while both exhausted and just wanting to sleep. The lady on reception was very rude back to me when I asked for a later check-out (because we hadn’t be able to sleep), and wouldn’t give it to us.   Was such an awful experience, don’t come here. Do not book this hostel!!! The room is cold as a fridge because there is no heating!!! It looks more like an overpriced prison dump with security than a hostel. If there is no heating in Paris until the end of November, then the price should be moderate. There are only 4 showers on the whole floor with \"hundred\" people staying. There is security in front of the hostel asking you for your card, then you have to check in 4 x times in order to get to your room: in front of the elevator, in the elevator, in the corridor when you leave the elevator, and then to get into the room. The elevator is so dysfunctional because you can use one card for one floor, so a bunch of people are all straggling to press the button with each card. On the 3. floor for safety reasons you cannot open the The staff were so lovely and helpful! I needed to print off some visas and they happily helped. The rooms and the bed were very comfortable. It was a great way to kick off my travels! Would definitely stay again!! No one expecting for even a good service from this hostel stuff but no need to be rude and highbrow to the customers .  very good going with each other but Stuff is rude . Rooms are clean. Showers and toilets are rubish can\\'t estimate when they were last cleaned.  I stayed for 5 nights ,last they they asked me to leave the lobby telling they can not let me wait at the lobby . It was just a seat i was occupying.  Had a really good stay there! I went with one friend and we met amazing people! The bar is cheap and nice!! A perfect way to meet new friends from around and from the hostle.  I recommend. Our windows was broken and they fixed it! It’s not Wow but it’s still cute!  The bathroom is really basic. I stayed in a shared bedroom with 10 beds for 4 nights and it was far from what the pictures promised. The hygiene there was far from okay and the showers were to badly cleaned I think there were mould there. Same goes for the toilets and sinks because they were not properly cleaned. The bed set was not okay either and the second night I discovered stain marks on the duvet.  You had barely to none reception, there were no chance of good wifi. And my key card didn’t work properly because I had to try again almost every time I had to use it other wise it would not be recognised.  However they had a private “dining area” or a room only visitors of the hostel could have access to and that was pretty nice. at an awful awful experience. I don’t even know where to begin! Let’s start with the bartenders at Belushi’s, i know your job is really hard serving overpriced drinks to happy tourists but the attitude is really unnecessary. Secondly our dorm. We’ve slept in many a hostel and never had such a bad experience. The elderly gentleman in the corner spent all night moaning in his sleep as well as coughing up a lung. The couple who woke up at 4 am to unpack and repack their entire luggage for an hour and not pay any mind to the other guests. The boogers on the wall next to your face. The endless amount of mosquitos. The people who just walk in and leave the lights on at 2 am. The man coughing up a lung in the common dining area too! Everyone seemed sick and under the weather and it was I went there while I saw they had availability on the website, she did check ins in front of me (she didn’t have sense of custumer service with them neither). So she refused to book a room for me, I did not have a place to stay as my nights in Disneyland finished, my flight was unexpectedly delayed and this girl did not even try to listen.   Where is the quality of her reception skills? Look, the location is nice because it\\'s right by the gare du nord station and that\\'s the extent of the positives for me. When we checked in, they informed us we would be receiving free breakfast in exchange for a positive review, well jokes on you because you\\'re not getting one, I will not be bribed! I don\\'t like when a company offers you something for free so you can give a good review. You bet I ate free breakfast though. However, I was in Paris, I should have been having an actual good meal so whatever, at least I saved money. Anyways, onto the hostel. Here\\'s the thing, the hostel surrounds a restaurant/bar/club. This is good when you want to eat at the hostel, this is bad when it\\'s 2 AM on the weekend and you want to sleep but can\\'t because the music is blasting and the bass On check in the staff were very friendly, BUT, the morning staff were very rude to me and my friends when they came to meet me. She rolled her eyes at the simplest of questions regarding the lockers for their bags. In addition to this, the security is supposed to be there to ensure safety, but was again very rude, and intimidating, bearing over four young women, and kept staring at me and my friends, making us feel incredibly uncomfortable!  We had intended to all stay there another night but because of the above reasons we decided to go elsewhere! Stayed here for two nights and had a great experience. Rooms and bathrooms were clean and comfortable, the bar next door is both cozy and lively, and Enrique at the front desk helped me resolve all of my questions with patience and kindness. Will be coming back when I’m in Paris. Barry held an amazing mojito making class! We learned a lot and made friends!  I love this hostel it is so much fun! Its my first night here and I already made a bunch of friends! I stayed at st Christopher’s in Berlin and it was amazing too. I recommend this hostel and the bar Belushi.. most importantly Barry’s mojitos every Friday!’n Barry taught us how to make amazing mojitos and it was a fabulous experience! It’s super cool they offer free classes. Love the hostel, very good rooms, vibes, and nice people. It seems like a good location too. Such a good stay for young backpackers! Lively bar and cool night activities. Including the mojito making class with BARRY the absolute legend!! So easy to meet people and they were able to provide such good recommendations for Paris! Barry taught a fantastic Mojito class that I would recommend to anyone traveling to Paris. Friday’s at St Christopher’s, show up for a good time and for good drinks. Great way to start off any trip, so go! The worker Barry - was so friendly and made us feel very welcome. Everyone was chatty and made us feel safe. I will be returning as I loved the atmosphere and the hostel was very clean and lots of activities to do in the evening Good bar and lounge areas,Elaine house manager on reception was excellent.The bathrooms need a make over shabby and untidy the dorms just about ok.Very little noise at night considering hundreds of guests staying. Great hostel. Staff are friendly and rooms are clean and spacious. The curtains across the beds are a great idea for privacy and to get sleep  lockers under beds. My only complaint was therevwas no soap on communal toilets. I asked them to put some in-they did once but didn\\'t bother other days Overall OK experience. In a great place close to everything and rooms were clean and comfortable. However, the showers were small and always dirty. There was a sort of yellow slime that lingered on the shower floor (I checked each one). This was unpleasant and really brings down my review. The bar was good with a nice atmosphere and the staff were friendly. I really enjoyed my trip but I don\\'t think I will stay here again.'},\n",

The shower is not big enough for a large human or a regular sized human. The card for the door kept not working. The tv doesn’t work. The receptionist tried to charge me on arrival an amount nearly £100 more than the confirmed room and breakfast rate for 3 nights. I also informed them that only two people would occupy the room and not 3. They said “all was in order”, handed me the key card, and just charged the local room tax to my card. Despite showing the head receptionist our booking details confirming the agreed rate and informing them of the reduced occupancy level, they still charged an additional £97.56 to my card two days after I departed. This matter was reported and resolved by Visa with an immediate refund of the overcharged amount. After sending two emails to their Customer Relation Service Manager before contacting Visa, I am still waiting to hear back from them. Maybe Visa will have more luck Rooms are very small, even for European standards. The bathroom is also tiny, the shower is so small there is no room to move.  Paper cups for tea/coffee and the hotel overall felt like staying in a youth hostel.  Warning signs everywhere about a spate of thefts in the hotel and to lock valuables in the room safe. However our room safe did not work, and despite informing reception staff of this it was never fixed.   The only positive about this hotel was the breakfast. They had a good selection of items on offer and the food quality was good. A perfect location, just 5 minutes walk from the Metro with good links. ( one change from the Gare Du Nord). We had a triple room, for me, mum and daughter. It was cosy but plenty of room when you only need it for sleeping in. The bathroom and the shower is small but didn’t really bother us too much. Clean and quiet. A small supermarket 50 yards away well stocked including fresh fruit. We didn’t partake of breakfast but went out early and ate in a cafe as we went. Polite helpful staff. Would stay here again.  HINT: Get a ‘Navigo Easy’ metro card. Like an Oyster, load it up with ‘rides’ and just swipe in when you need to.  Excellent location a few minutes walk from the metro station. There is supermarket located on the same street which has all the essentials. A few minutes walk from Bercy village which has a range of restaurants, bars and shops.   The hotel room was clean, and was suitable for a short city break for a family of 3, including a 6 year old. The room we had came with a double bed and a single bed.   The hotel staff couldn’t do enough for you, we had to bring medicine that needed to be kept in the fridge for my daughter. They were always on hand to get us the medicine and put it back in fridge when used.   100% would recommend staying here and would look to stay here again when we visit in the future. The transport links made it easy to get around the city and explore the sights, also Nice Location. 5 minute walk from cour San emilie station. Good neighborhood too.  Lots of restaurants and shops around the hotel. Breakfast spread is a good mix of french pastries, cold cuts, cheese and eggs. As for drinks, you have coffee, chocolate, milk and juices. They offer luggage storage. You just need to bring your luggage in their luggage room.  The room is small which is typical European size. For a city break we couldn't have had a better hotel. Staff were friendly, room was clean and breakfast was nice. Also there was a little bar on the ground floor which was good for having a couple of drinks before heading back to the room. Would definitely stay at this hotel again in the future! Location could have been better- but the metro closure made this worst so we used Ubers.  Great breakfast with Tropicana juice and fresh coffees.  Friendly staff.  Very clean bed sheets, although rooms were small for a city break this was okay 👍 Stayed her for 5 nights great hotel spotless and very comfy , small room as mist European  rooms are ,great power shower although slightly  snug ,Very friendly  and helpful  staff with great breakfast and in a fab location  5 minute walk to metro so easy access to all sight seeing attractions.  Bercy village  is a 2 minute  walk what a little gem lovely vibrate place to eat or ho for a drink ,supermarket  next to hotel great selection  of fresh food and anything else you may need . My only little niggle is the paper cups  for your tea or coffee in the room ,too hot to hold  when filled and very flimsy an accident  waiting  to happen  ( we brought a couple if cheap mugs to use ) . Great hotel will certainly  return   We booked this hotel as it had good reviews and is located near the Accor Arena. We were really pleased with it. It’s modern, clean, the beds are super-comfy and everything worked well eg the check-in, WiFi, baggage store. And the area is nice and safe, with the Seine, Bercy Park, trendy Bercy Village and the Metro (Cour St Emilion) just a few minutes’ walk away. A handy, well-stocked supermarket, Franprix, is next door. Highly recommended. Budget, tiny, rooms with coffin size shower at luxury prices. Beds are clean and comfy but hotel is old fashioned, bathroom is hardly large enough to turn around in and coffin size showers impossible to bend over in.   The rooms are very very small and not even a cup for your morning tea or coffee, just paper cups and not so much as a spoon to stir it with.   It's like a backpacker hostel but at professional prices.  Bercy is lovely and metro close by but book closer to Paris central districts and tourist attractions for lower prices.  We had a comfortable , if claustrophobic, stay but paid way too much for the experience Room small but clean and functional. Staff very friendly. Superb breakfast. Very closed from Bercy villages its restaurants shops and bars and near métro St Emilion station. Also closed to à wonderful Park and of course the Arena  Will be back for sure. This hotel was lovely, clean ,  helpful and polite staff and had all you needed except proper mugs. They only provided paper cups that were too hot and flimsy for us, danger of scolding. Acess to both Metros Cour St Emilion and Bercy stations. We didn't have breakfast or u se the bar so can't comment. Hotel was as expected, nothing to complain about the hotel itself. My wife's earrings disappeared from our room while we were away. There was a cigarette butt on the floor of our balcony. Everything else had been left untouched, laptops etc. We reported this to staff at reception. They were surprised and sorry but didn't tell us the next day how they had handled the situation. I hope there are no more thieving cleaning personnel at the hotel. My wife and I stayed here for a night on our way south. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Although the room was fairly small, it was air conditioned. Bercy is also a nice quiet area of Paris, yet close to several major train stations. Nice buffet breakfast too with a good selection. Would be happy to stay here again. The staff members at the hotel were extremely welcoming. We were able to store our luggage within the hotel before check-in time, which was handy. The room was clean and tidy. There was plenty of storage space for a four-day trip and would definitely stay again!! At the price I wasn't expecting 4* luxury and that was fine.  The room was small and the aircon noisy but the breakfast was great.  There was a wide choice - cereals, nice bread, fruit, yogurts, waffles, pancakes, meat and cheese.  I wasn't expecting hot food but we had frankfurters and scrambled eggs.  I've stayed in many French hotels and long ago came to the conclusion that the French can't make scrambled eggs.  The Campanile proved me wrong.  They were excellent.  Coffee and juice were from a machine.  The croissants deserve a special mention as they were excellent.  The staff were really on the ball and  as things ran out they were replenished quickly.  There's a little bar which shuts at midnight.  Our barmaid was very friendly.  There was a problem with our shower The price and location of this hotel is a must. Literally, the hotel is 3 minutes walk away from the metro. The metro - cour saint-emilion. To attractions, the average to reach Eiffel tower, Louvre, etc is around 20 to 25 minutes via the metro. Nearby are restaurants, cinema, mini supermarkets and clothes shops via Bercy Village.  Back to the hotel. Upon reaching it, you are greeted with multi lingual staff who still wear face masks. They are well mannered members.   Rooms are reasonable size. Not too small and not too big. Shower room is ok but shower is a bit small.  Now for some impressive things I have noticed. Fast WiFi! I mean very fast WiFi! There is also multilingual channels too.  Downstairs there is a bar and breakfast area.   Everything was absolutely great.Amazing staff, nice hotel, great location and absolutely amazing breakfast.Our room was cleaned every day and we could make coffee every evening. We will definitely be happy to return here. For travellers on a budget travelling with family, this is a great hotel! Located in the arrondissement 12, the location is perfect to connect in all Paris via metro or bus. Also, daily is offered a generous and fresh breakfast which includes eggs, sausages, orange juice, seasonal fruits, hams and the freshly baked croissants and pain au chocolate among other delicious selections. Convenient 2 grocery stores and a variety of restaurants and shopping in Bercy Village. The rooms are small but the beds are comfortable and with sparkling linens, air conditioning that works perfectly. The bath can be small but is super clean and with clean towels all time, the shower with warm water. Great customer service. I definitely recommend the hotel and wish to come back again! Myself and my teenage daughter stayed here for 3 nights 22/7 - 25/7. Please bear in mind that the hotel had only just reopened after Coronavirus restrictions. The positives:- Super clean. Comfy beds with memory foam pillow and normal pillow. Near to metro station. Near to supermarket and shopping area. Bercy village on the doorstep with a range of restaurants offering different cuisines and many bars. Safe neighbourhood. We didn’t have the breakfast so can’t comment on that. Good double glazed sound proof windows. The negatives:- Small room size and bathroom (but this is typically European). The safe is located on the floor which is not easy to access given the tight space of the room or the lighting to see to the back of the safe. Shower floor can be slippery when wet so be I have a reservation with them in Booking.com and even though my cancelation policy was non-refundable due to the coronavirus situation they were willing to cancel it for free. Debra and Miriam helped me to solve my issue, I'm very grateful for them. This hotel was lovely and in a very good location, the rooms were clean and a reasonable size. The beds were comfy and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Very reasonable price too. Would definitely stay again. We booked this as mystery hotel and were not disappointed. Room size was European in size, but totally adequate for our needs, we had a family room for 2 adults and a child. The reception team were good and multi lingual (Deborah was very good. Location is an easy walk to Bercy Village where there are plenty restaurants and cafes, at the Village there is a metro station which we used to get into the centre of Paris (Eiffel Tower etc). Just remember the hotel room is  a small European size (which was expected). Other than that , great and good value. This hotel was very good for the money spent. The location was also good, having the metro Cour Saint-Emilion so close. The breakfast was also good with a selection of hot or cold buffet. The nearby area was very nice and there is a wide range of restaurants where to dine.  Amazing experience, everything was perfect, worth the price! 🤗 we enjoyed the breakfast they have many options including pancakes, waffles and frozen yoghurt🙏😊 the room was clear, the place is quiet. Only 5min away from Bercy Village with dozens of shops and restaurant, and overlooking a nice leafy park with kids playgrounds, a skate park, a cinema and an ice-rink for teens. Easy access to Paris city centre by Metro. Very clean compact rooms with comfy beds and plenty of hot water. Some triple rooms available. Decent breakfast, handy luggage room and friendly service. Excellent mid-range option for a short city-break with kids. I don't usually write reviews.  However, I am making an exception for this hotel.  Three of us, all adults, stayed in a triple room from November 26, 2019 - December 2, 2019.  The room, while a little tight, was fine for the three of us.  The hotel and our room was spotlessly clean and the staff, most of whom speak English, were gracious and helpful.  The beds and pillows were very comfortable.  We all slept very well.  The breakfast is good, particularly because it came with the room.  There was  much variety of food and coffee.    The location of this hotel is great.  Just two short blocks to the Cour St. Emillion metro station on a line that gets you anywhere you need to go in the City.  A block away is Bercy Village, a renovated area that used to be wine warehouses, and is We came via Eurostar and this Hotel was part of the package we booked. We stayed 2 nights. It is extremely easy to get to from Gare Du Nord. Use train (Green) D then change in Chatelet to line 14 - dark purple, takes 30 minutes. The location is next to the Bercy Village complex which is a delightful shopping/eating village, really beautiful shops for presents to take home.  On arrival in the hotel we were greeted with a smile by a lovely Receptionist who even also spoke English. The room was a decent size for a city, small bathroom with a shower in it. Enough space for a couple on a citybreak. Tea and coffee making facilities were there/ also TV . Everything was very clean, 2 pillows to choose from: one Memory foam, one other one..  I specially liked the soap dispenser at the This hotel located in a very good area. We stayed in Kyriad hotel for 5 days. Rooms are very clean. Breakfast every day the same, but fresh and delicious. We also eat dinner in the hotel, very good price and very delicious food. I can say big thank you to all staff, they are very helpful and always smilling. This hotel has good atmosphere and is locate in very quiet and safe area.  We had selected Kyriad Hotel via the Eurostar booking and price was very attractive. The best part if the Hotel is just 3 mins walk from the nearest Metro (Cour Saint Emillon) . Room was little small though and shower cubicle space was quite restricted ...problem if bather is big size. Room was clean. Room Wifi is available but has to       re-login back everytime trying to access it after disconnection. Most other hotel free WiFi are auto-login after the first setup.  Hotel offer free storage space for luggages if arrive well before the checkin time. Nearby there are plenty of food choices ..we tried one Asian restaurant nearby and price was reasonable and food was nice.  There is also a rather big supermarket near to the hotel. Less than a min walk only.  Hotel breakfast This hotel is located in the Bercy area, the nearest metro stop being Cour St-Emilion (line 14) - only 3 stops from Chatelet, making it so easy to get to Paris Central. I took the RER B from CDG Airport and changed to Line 14 at Chatelet-Les Halles, all very smooth and fast. No fuss!!  For its location, I would say that the price is very reasonable. The staff were polite and not overly friendly (which is fine with me). The room and bed is very comfortable. Kettle is provided in the room, with tea, coffee, milk and biscuits. Soap is provided by the sink and in the shower, but no shampoo, conditioner or lotion (so, bring your own!). For those reviewers who complained about the size of the room, well, they obviously have not travelled much around the European cities. For me, the Kyriad hotel is a good hotel placed in a fabulous area (Bercy Village). The hotel is standard in every way, not pretentious at all, but offering basic service with not so basic prices. The room is rather small, but mine had a balcony overlooking the street, so it did not feel so cramped. I had a good sleep quality, mostly due to the memory foam pillows. There was not so much noise, so I slept rather well. Check-in and out was smooth, and staff did their job correctly (I mean, not going the extra mile in any sense of the word). It is a good 3 star hotel, with good service and placed in a great area, full of shops and restaurants and at the Metro Line 14, which is the best in my opinion, connecting with Paris really fast. We stayed at Kyriad paris bercy village for three nights on our vacation to Paris.  Advantages:  - Located very near to Metro station and bus stop is also just outside of hotel so it is very easy to get around city using public transportation. Many reataurants/bars available just outside metro station and hence easy availability of food near by  - Staff is helpful and available to answer your queries  - Tea/coffee maker in the room  - Bed and mattress were comfortable to sleep  Improvements:  - Room size was very small even when we were given the biggest room in the entire hotel as per hotel staff. Hardly any space in room to stand or even keep your luggage comfortably  - No or very poor bathroom toiletries Bathroom/Toilet seemed very old style and had a feel of old house type Nothing I can fault really. Location is great, close to the metro, lots of restaurants and shops. 10 minutes walking from the Accor Hotels Arena. Room was quite small but ok, didn’t need more for the 2 nights we stayed there. Bed and pillows were very comfy-it could be a matter of preference but the pilows with memory foam and matress are just like what we have at home, hadn’t it been for the alarm we’d never wake up. One of the most clean places we’ve ever stayed, beyond impressed! Maybe it’s not the newest stuff but the bed and the clenliness did everything for us. 24 hours reception also good as we checked in after 23, it was perfect for us! I would definetly return, the area hasn’t been fully explored yet. Great place to stay for any couple that’s looking for quality for the We had just had a very long and delayed train trip from Milan and when we arrived at the hotel at 9pm we were told that our booking had been cancelled and that there were no rooms available. Thankfully I had my booking confirmation voucher and proof of payment. Eventually the duty manager accepted my proof of booking and a room was actually found! The room was small, the shower was very small but the room was clean, quiet and comfortable and served the purpose it was intended for - an overnight stay on our way home. Bar area and staff were very nice. I was asked to pay for the room on checkout again! the duty manager was too busy to speak to me but I got it sorted out eventually. The moral of the story is not to book through a third party - we booked through Cancelon who hadn't We stayed at the Kyriad Hotel Paris Bercy Village from September 25 - 29, 2019. This is a mid range hotel that was reasonably priced with a subway close by. The rooms were adequately cleaned, staff were friendly and helpful. There is a grocery store close by and plenty of restaurants. This was a great base for us to use the subway to get to all the points you don't want to miss while in Paris! Stayed here for a few days and it is a great location to get around Paris. The metro is a few hundred metres from the front door. The staff at the hotel are knowledgeable, friendly and very accommodating. Highly recommend this hotel. We stayed here for one night on our way to Italy and that was enough. The room was clean and quite comfortable but very small like a poor relation of Premier Inn.  It’s in an area without much to offer in terms of anything to do in the evening and the hotel doesn’t really offer much either.  Depends what you’re after and it is perfectly adequate just not somewhere you want to do anything other than sleep. The Hotel is close to the metro station Cour Saint-Emilion (line 14), in a nice area, with plenty of shops and restaurants, in Bercy Village. Within 15 minutes you can reach the city center / Chatelet Les Halles, still using metro line 14. The hotel staff was very friendly. The rooms are clean, maybe a little uninspired. Breakfast is very nice, the pains au chocolat are top of class!  Overall: a nice stay in a not so overcrowded area of Paris.\"}]"

stations The Gate stands as an iconic building at the gateway to the City of London providing those who stay there with both unrivalled accessibility to the modern City of London and a beautiful place

food and beverage partner Maple  Co provides a delicious yet healthy range of hot meals salads cold press juices and glutenfree options as well as from our wellstocked Maple  The Gate delicatessen and caf in the Ground Floor LobbyFrom the hospitality to the room  The Gate Hotel is amazing We were greeted by a lovely receptionist who went over and beyond to ensure our stay was extra special Our room was upgraded upon arrival which was a great surprise Would definitely recommend  We spent 7 days at The Gate in August 2022 and we enjoyed every minute of it Here are 5 reasons you should go for The Gate if you are searching for modern comfort convenience and service  a\\tModern feel The building is very nice very modern and very clean It makes living in the apartments and the common areas a very comfortable experience all the time Spotless all the time   b\\tService I found it very nice and convenient to be offered complementary coffee every morning at the breakfast area on Floor 5 Nice touch  c\\tFriendly staff We were very impressed the staff specifically with Gabriella who helped us throughout our stay with all sorts of questions restaurants attractions markets parking lots etc When we checked in we reported an issue with the AC The building is beautiful and modernThe service was greatThank you to VicenteMohammad and Stefania We were happy that we could you the lounge every time we want Lovely and clean room A lot of off options to choose around the area The hotel is a very solid choice for this area and any issues were minor  Close to multiple subway and bus lines you can get to any spot in London easily   Lots of nice eateries walking distance try Fanzi next door or Amber  Very quiet area at night  The rooms and suites and one bedroom apartments are all extremely small surprising for a newer structure in London but very clean   The sofa bed is very comfortable   Be aware there are no king size beds just doubles so plan accordingly  Staff were very nice kudos to Vincent especially who was highly professional and went above and beyond to help   Unfortunately we spoke to other staff who did not know how to adjust the thermostats press thr right side button of three unmarked buttons then set temp wheel and we Our stay in The Gate Hotel London is going great But thanks to Mohammad Vincent Reneta and Lutfur its going wonderfully  We had a little inconvenience do to our own mistake but Mohammad saved our vacation Thanks to his generosity and kindness we are having a wonderful time This is our second day of our 6 day stay and we couldnt be happier The building is very nice very modern and clean Friendly staff that will help with any questions or concerns So far a wonderful experience at The Gate and would not hesitate to recommend it 5 stars for sure   This was our last stop before heading home to Australia for three nights We stayed at the Wilde Apartments just down the street at the beginning of the trip but in the interests of market research booked this on the way out  This place is modern just like the Wilde but our experience was different  The address may be White Chapel Lane but its on the corner of a busy road just like the Wilde We love the East end of London with its vibe and energy but we like a good nights sleep  We had booked several months out and requested a quiet room but got allocated one on a lower floor facing the A13 Despite being touted for long stays this was just a hotel room with a small kitchenette no table and chairs for dining  We asked for another room and got a nice corner accessible one it claims to be 5  for this it would be cheap and the location is super its a 3 star superior or 4 star nice rooms but small with kitchenette no service for towels etc  this would be good  if you knew otherwise your pull your wet towels out of the shower tray and use again lounge in 5 th floor is good but you dont know where to find stuff etc cleanliness is good  personell friendly so not advertised fully correctly price for 3 star plus at location on higher side  location top Group of 10 ladies had an overnight here for a friends birthday The service was excellent rooms a decent size quality bedding although double beds are slightly on the small size Clean and very good customer service with complementary tea coffee and a small mini bar also complimentary I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend  I recently stayed at The Gate for my partners birthday and it did not disappoint After booking I reached out to the hotel to see if they were able to offer any complimentary upgrades to make our stay extra special Jamal who took care of my request via email was incredibly kind and helpful and ensured that a note was made on our reservation to fulfil our requirements subject to availability   We arrived at the hotel earlier than our check in time and were greeted with the lovely Gabriela who was so friendly and bubbly She allowed us to check in earlier than usual and upgraded us to a high level room which had a beautiful view of the city and even a pint on the house for the birthday boy   The rooms were beautifully decorated quite unique bathrooms and had a very Nice room comfortable and quiet and well appointed with modern facilities and bathroom Well located and I would recommend staying here The front of house staff were very helpful Thanks a lot for helping us with our stay Friendly staff accommodated very well Followed instructions Muhammad was very helpful and kind Hotel was perfect Very nice room and clean and tidy Pricey but definitely worth the stay Will definitely be staying here again Stayed here recently with my Girlfriend and we had a perfect stay room was lovely and the staff were attentive and friendly Specifically Mohammad Vincent and Gabi Thanks guys  Really recommend  Amazing stay at The Gate for my boyfriends birthday Mohammad was so accommodating and made our experience so enjoyable We stayed in the penthouse and the views were beautiful and the bed was super comfortable  Friendly and helpful staff  who recommended a couple of local restaurants to try cosy and comfy room  lovely lounge area open 24  7 to relax and have free juice or coffee Excellent buffet breakfast that was also great value for money Great location  Highly recommend would definitely stay here again Highly recommend Nice room with nice shampoo and body wash Nice view too if stay at higher floors The nearby streets do not feel that safe at night and nearest train station only have stairs Walkable distance to fast food and supermarkets  Minor inconvenience Doesnt have daily housekeeping and only throw rubbish and refresh towels every 4th day We stayed at The Gate due to its fantastic location and when we got there it was absolutely the case We performed the early checkin prior to arrival but when we arrived it wasnt clear how to then scan the QR code provided in the email so we ended up manually checkingin which made the online checkin somewhat pointless   We paid 451 for two nights including breakfast in one of the studio apartments compared to other hotels Ive stayed in for similar prices in London I felt the room left a lot to be desired It was clean and tidy but the room itself was showing signs of age with chips and chunks taken from the wall the carpet looking well trodden I just expected more for the price   The kitchen was well equipped with what you would need to keep yourself going and Excellent hotelElegant and modern apartamentsWell Located closed to the underground station I would like to say thank you to VicenteMohammadStefania and Gosia They were really polite and friendly  Beautiful decorationLovely smell Vicente and Stefania are reslly great host I loved Le Labo toiletries The hotel is good located and a walking distsnce to Brick Lane and Liverpool street station I would recommend tobook a Skyline apartment and have amazing views Such a reasonably priced hotel Absolutely lovely lobby with a quick check in A room on the 18th floor so pretty cool view tv with sound bar Stocked kitchenette and a greatsized shower  The only downside was we had a connecting room with someone else and we could hear their tv through it as well as the odd cough Made me a little uncomfortable with it being so close but honestly for such a reasonable price this hotel is well worth it Good facilities comfortable and cozy with excelent views and well connected with public transport Very good customer service especially from Vicente who answered all our questions and provided excelent service So close to so much Out the door to the left Efes for amazing Turkish food Grounded for breakfast Great curry down bricklane  To the right pizza or pasta at Amelias  So close to the underground to get anywhere  Short walk to the Tower of London and tower bridge or one stop on tube Great market across the street  Love the staff Loved it all An excellent place to stay very good efficient staff and excellent check in process by Mr Mohamed  Mr Vincent   The hotel is very clean and well maintained The best location and hundreds of restaurants around  Love to come back and stay here Very good for long term stays and very accommodative for long term rates The team at Flavour Venues  Events recently had the pleasure of staying at The Gate Hotel This luxury aparthotel exceeded our expectations and provided us with a quiet and very comfortable stay in a bustling part of the City This Aldgate based hotel has excellent transport links and is walking distance from City business hubs plus popular locations such as Tower Bridge Brick Lane and Shoreditch Despite its busy location The Gate provides an atmosphere of serenity plus a very warm welcome The Gate Hotel London boasts a strong collection of 189 apartment bedrooms Our Superior Apartment had excellent soundproofing and offered fabulous views of the surrounding area The design of the room made fantastic use of the space comfortably including a bathroom kitchen dining I stayed in this hotel for more than 8 months The room was wonderful and the people very nice The room was equipped with a kitchen washing machine dishing machine and two TVs I had a really nice stay Really amazing hotel It was my friends birthday weekend and we got upgraded to a suite which was a lovely surprise Mohammad was very welcoming and helpful on the front desk  very informative and friendly  Have stayed in London 3 times over the past few years but this was the first  time to stay at The Gate first time in the East End  I was there with my son daughter grandson and his wife for 5 nights at the end of September 2023 We had a terrific time because Rooms were very comfortable  good sleeping every night we appreciated the kitchenette facilities  dishwasher basic dishes glasses and table service clothes washerdryer unit and fridge  The 5th floor lounge was a big plus   complimentary coffee and flavored water available all day and evening very reasonably priced and good quality Continental breakfasts every morning  hot breakfasts also available but we were fine without comfy furniture and lots of windows for the times we just wanted to sit all I love staying at the gate The staff are always so nice Gabriele and her team always welcome me back with a smile and warm welcome The rooms are so much better than a hotel And the 5th floor lounge is so convenient especially staying with colleagues as a place to hang out and not be in the lobby or each others rooms  I like the gym  had all the basics  perhaps a bit small Over 6 people is tight but usually a mix of people doing cardio vs resistance training Convenient to liverpool street station and walks across tower bridge and the south bank The room had excellent amenities and a fabulous view The staff Mohammad Stefanie and Renata were very helpful and took care of everything The space is very modern and the bed was comfortable although would be great to have option of non feather pillows and covers for those with allergies Location is close to station and also supermarket and several restaurants Would stay here again  What a treat to stay at The Gate for a business trip The room is spacious and comfortable I especially like that there is a lot of storage in the shower room The lounge in the fifth floor is a modern and relaxing place to gather before or after dinner We stayed at The Gate for 2 nights earlier this week and thoroughly enjoyed our time there  Our room was very well equipped and the bed very comfy  We also thought the 5th floor lounge was a nice touch and as well as having breakfast there we used it to get a cup of coffee when we returned to the hotel in the evening  Special mention must also go to Gabriella and Mohamad who were so helpful in giving us directions to the various places we were visiting Stayed here for a couple for weeks The location is great for getting around London The studio Ive stayed in had everything I needed and was kept very clean The staff was nice and helpful most notably Stefanie Vicente and Yozlem I would like to thank all of the Gates staff for truly making my stay truly unforgettable especially Stefania and Vicente that welcome me upon checkin My room was spacious and clean and the mattress was very comfortable The hotel is located couple of minutes walk from the tube and they also have a small selection of salads and burgers for dinner Ill be back I was very happy in my stay everything was clean very quiet place I slept very good also high speed WiFi  Nice view in my room everything around you restaurants and supper market And the important thing the staff all of them friendly and helpful especially Mohammad with lovely smile and welcoming    I  have been staying at the Gate since April 2023 and Im here for 6 months I thought of taking some time to reflect on my experience during my last month here for the benefit of others considering this place for a medium to longterm stay  In summary I recommend The Gate for their rooms the amenities and the people  The people  Everyone from the front desk staff to the room service crew are friendly professional and always willing to help Special shoutout to Vicente and Mohammed Since my very first day here in April Vicente has always greeted me with a smile and stopped to ask how I was doing no matter if I was in a rush or if he was tied up with guests He has always been available to help with anything I needed and throughout my time here he kindly helped me Amazing experience great apartment Comfortable bed and absolutely gorgeous view Air conditioning helped a lot during heatwave in London Staff was really helpful and very friendly We booked again following our stay and will be back more  Friendly  welcoming staff Modern  well maintained hotel with lovely interior We stayed in a lovely studio apartment Comfy bed Room was very clean  well equipped with a city view Would recommend  Had to book a last minute room after missing our Eurostar now we know to be there at least an hour before departure Vicente and Mohammed at the front desk did an amazing job at accommodating us and had our room ready only an hour after we booked We had a great time at the Gate Hotel the facilities are great and the staff is amazing specially Stefania The area where the hotel is located is perfect and close to the universities  The lounge on the 5th floor is great to gran a cup of coffee or get work done Thanks for the great stay The Gate London Hotel provides a memorable and comfortable stay in the heart of London The impeccable service stylish accommodations and excellent dining options make it a top choice for travelers looking to experience the best of the city I would gladly return for another stay and highly recommend it to fellow travelers During my recent stay at The Gate London Hotel I had the privilege of interacting with Mohammad at the reception and I must say his exceptional service left a lasting impression  My wife and I and our son had a wonderful stay at The Gate We stayed in The Residence which had two bedrooms two bathrooms and a kitchenette There was also a combination washerdryer which was a great convenience The space was roomy and well appointed It was very clean The staff were wonderful and responsive to our every need There is a small grocery store right across the street so we were able to get food for breakfast and snacks One small drawback was given the fact that they dont service the room every day we had to find places to hang our towels to dry which was a bit of a challenge Also the combo washer dryer is a mystery to us Canadians but the maintenance staff kindly gave us a crash course in its use Because the hotel is a bit off the tourist track but there', 'review_title': 'Amazing experience ', 'review_text_x': 'From the hospitality to the room  The Gate Hotel is amazing We were greeted by a lovely receptionist

receptionist who went over and beyond to ensure our stay was extra special Our room was upgraded upon arrival which was a great surprise Would definitely recommend  We spent 7 days at The Gate in August 2022 and we enjoyed every minute of it Here are 5 reasons you should go for The Gate if you are searching for modern comfort convenience and service  a\\tModern feel The building is very nice very modern and very clean It makes living in the apartments and the common areas a very comfortable experience all the time Spotless all the time   b\\tService I found it very nice and convenient to be offered complementary coffee every morning at the breakfast area on Floor 5 Nice touch  c\\tFriendly staff We were very impressed the staff specifically with Gabriella who helped us throughout our stay with all sorts of questions restaurants attractions markets parking lots etc When we checked in we reported an issue with the AC The building is beautiful and modernThe service was greatThank you to VicenteMohammad and Stefania We were happy that we could you the lounge every time we want Lovely and clean room A lot of off options to choose around the area The hotel is a very solid choice for this area and any issues were minor  Close to multiple subway and bus lines you can get to any spot in London easily   Lots of nice eateries walking distance try Fanzi next door or Amber  Very quiet area at night  The rooms and suites and one bedroom apartments are all extremely small surprising for a newer structure in London but very clean   The sofa bed is very comfortable   Be aware there are no king size beds just doubles so plan accordingly  Staff were very nice kudos to Vincent especially who was highly professional and went above and beyond to help   Unfortunately we spoke to other staff who did not know how to adjust the thermostats press thr right side button of three unmarked buttons then set temp wheel and we Our stay in The Gate Hotel London is going great But thanks to Mohammad Vincent Reneta and Lutfur its going wonderfully  We had a little inconvenience do to our own mistake but Mohammad saved our vacation Thanks to his generosity and kindness we are having a wonderful time This is our second day of our 6 day stay and we couldnt be happier The building is very nice very modern and clean Friendly staff that will help with any questions or concerns So far a wonderful experience at The Gate and would not hesitate to recommend it 5 stars for sure   This was our last stop before heading home to Australia for three nights We stayed at the Wilde Apartments just down the street at the beginning of the trip but in the interests of market research booked this on the way out  This place is modern just like the Wilde but our experience was different  The address may be White Chapel Lane but its on the corner of a busy road just like the Wilde We love the East end of London with its vibe and energy but we like a good nights sleep  We had booked several months out and requested a quiet room but got allocated one on a lower floor facing the A13 Despite being touted for long stays this was just a hotel room with a small kitchenette no table and chairs for dining  We asked for another room and got a nice corner accessible one it claims to be 5  for this it would be cheap and the location is super its a 3 star superior or 4 star nice rooms but small with kitchenette no service for towels etc  this would be good  if you knew otherwise your pull your wet towels out of the shower tray and use again lounge in 5 th floor is good but you dont know where to find stuff etc cleanliness is good  personell friendly so not advertised fully correctly price for 3 star plus at location on higher side  location top Group of 10 ladies had an overnight here for a friends birthday The service was excellent rooms a decent size quality bedding although double beds are slightly on the small size Clean and very good customer service with complementary tea coffee and a small mini bar also complimentary I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend  I recently stayed at The Gate for my partners birthday and it did not disappoint After booking I reached out to the hotel to see if they were able to offer any complimentary upgrades to make our stay extra special Jamal who took care of my request via email was incredibly kind and helpful and ensured that a note was made on our reservation to fulfil our requirements subject to availability   We arrived at the hotel earlier than our check in time and were greeted with the lovely Gabriela who was so friendly and bubbly She allowed us to check in earlier than usual and upgraded us to a high level room which had a beautiful view of the city and even a pint on the house for the birthday boy   The rooms were beautifully decorated quite unique bathrooms and had a very Nice room comfortable and quiet and well appointed with modern facilities and bathroom Well located and I would recommend staying here The front of house staff were very helpful Thanks a lot for helping us with our stay Friendly staff accommodated very well Followed instructions Muhammad was very helpful and kind Hotel was perfect Very nice room and clean and tidy Pricey but definitely worth the stay Will definitely be staying here again Stayed here recently with my Girlfriend and we had a perfect stay room was lovely and the staff were attentive and friendly Specifically Mohammad Vincent and Gabi Thanks guys  Really recommend  Amazing stay at The Gate for my boyfriends birthday Mohammad was so accommodating and made our experience so enjoyable We stayed in the penthouse and the views were beautiful and the bed was super comfortable  Friendly and helpful staff  who recommended a couple of local restaurants to try cosy and comfy room  lovely lounge area open 24  7 to relax and have free juice or coffee Excellent buffet breakfast that was also great value for money Great location  Highly recommend would definitely stay here again Highly recommend Nice room with nice shampoo and body wash Nice view too if stay at higher floors The nearby streets do not feel that safe at night and nearest train station only have stairs Walkable distance to fast food and supermarkets  Minor inconvenience Doesnt have daily housekeeping and only throw rubbish and refresh towels every 4th day We stayed at The Gate due to its fantastic location and when we got there it was absolutely the case We performed the early checkin prior to arrival but when we arrived it wasnt clear how to then scan the QR code provided in the email so we ended up manually checkingin which made the online checkin somewhat pointless   We paid 451 for two nights including breakfast in one of the studio apartments compared to other hotels Ive stayed in for similar prices in London I felt the room left a lot to be desired It was clean and tidy but the room itself was showing signs of age with chips and chunks taken from the wall the carpet looking well trodden I just expected more for the price   The kitchen was well equipped with what you would need to keep yourself going and Excellent hotelElegant and modern apartamentsWell Located closed to the underground station I would like to say thank you to VicenteMohammadStefania and Gosia They were really polite and friendly  Beautiful decorationLovely smell Vicente and Stefania are reslly great host I loved Le Labo toiletries The hotel is good located and a walking distsnce to Brick Lane and Liverpool street station I would recommend tobook a Skyline apartment and have amazing views Such a reasonably priced hotel Absolutely lovely lobby with a quick check in A room on the 18th floor so pretty cool view tv with sound bar Stocked kitchenette and a greatsized shower  The only downside was we had a connecting room with someone else and we could hear their tv through it as well as the odd cough Made me a little uncomfortable with it being so close but honestly for such a reasonable price this hotel is well worth it Good facilities comfortable and cozy with excelent views and well connected with public transport Very good customer service especially from Vicente who answered all our questions and provided excelent service So close to so much Out the door to the left Efes for amazing Turkish food Grounded for breakfast Great curry down bricklane  To the right pizza or pasta at Amelias  So close to the underground to get anywhere  Short walk to the Tower of London and tower bridge or one stop on tube Great market across the street  Love the staff Loved it all An excellent place to stay very good efficient staff and excellent check in process by Mr Mohamed  Mr Vincent   The hotel is very clean and well maintained The best location and hundreds of restaurants around  Love to come back and stay here Very good for long term stays and very accommodative for long term rates The team at Flavour Venues  Events recently had the pleasure of staying at The Gate Hotel This luxury aparthotel exceeded our expectations and provided us with a quiet and very comfortable stay in a bustling part of the City This Aldgate based hotel has excellent transport links and is walking distance from City business hubs plus popular locations such as Tower Bridge Brick Lane and Shoreditch Despite its busy location The Gate provides an atmosphere of serenity plus a very warm welcome The Gate Hotel London boasts a strong collection of 189 apartment bedrooms Our Superior Apartment had excellent soundproofing and offered fabulous views of the surrounding area The design of the room made fantastic use of the space comfortably including a bathroom kitchen dining I stayed in this hotel for more than 8 months The room was wonderful and the people very nice The room was equipped with a kitchen washing machine dishing machine and two TVs I had a really nice stay Really amazing hotel It was my friends birthday weekend and we got upgraded to a suite which was a lovely surprise Mohammad was very welcoming and helpful on the front desk  very informative and friendly  Have stayed in London 3 times over the past few years but this was the first  time to stay at The Gate first time in the East End  I was there with my son daughter grandson and his wife for 5 nights at the end of September 2023 We had a terrific time because Rooms were very comfortable  good sleeping every night we appreciated the kitchenette facilities  dishwasher basic dishes glasses and table service clothes washerdryer unit and fridge  The 5th floor lounge was a big plus   complimentary coffee and flavored water available all day and evening very reasonably priced and good quality Continental breakfasts every morning  hot breakfasts also available but we were fine without comfy furniture and lots of windows for the times we just wanted to sit all I love staying at the gate The staff are always so nice Gabriele and her team always welcome me back with a smile and warm welcome The rooms are so much better than a hotel And the 5th floor lounge is so convenient especially staying with colleagues as a place to hang out and not be in the lobby or each others rooms  I like the gym  had all the basics  perhaps a bit small Over 6 people is tight but usually a mix of people doing cardio vs resistance training Convenient to liverpool street station and walks across tower bridge and the south bank The room had excellent amenities and a fabulous view The staff Mohammad Stefanie and Renata were very helpful and took care of everything The space is very modern and the bed was comfortable although would be great to have option of non feather pillows and covers for those with allergies Location is close to station and also supermarket and several restaurants Would stay here again  What a treat to stay at The Gate for a business trip The room is spacious and comfortable I especially like that there is a lot of storage in the shower room The lounge in the fifth floor is a modern and relaxing place to gather before or after dinner We stayed at The Gate for 2 nights earlier this week and thoroughly enjoyed our time there  Our room was very well equipped and the bed very comfy  We also thought the 5th floor lounge was a nice touch and as well as having breakfast there we used it to get a cup of coffee when we returned to the hotel in the evening  Special mention must also go to Gabriella and Mohamad who were so helpful in giving us directions to the various places we were visiting Stayed here for a couple for weeks The location is great for getting around London The studio Ive stayed in had everything I needed and was kept very clean The staff was nice and helpful most notably Stefanie Vicente and Yozlem I would like to thank all of the Gates staff for truly making my stay truly unforgettable especially Stefania and Vicente that welcome me upon checkin My room was spacious and clean and the mattress was very comfortable The hotel is located couple of minutes walk from the tube and they also have a small selection of salads and burgers for dinner Ill be back I was very happy in my stay everything was clean very quiet place I slept very good also high speed WiFi  Nice view in my room everything around you restaurants and supper market And the important thing the staff all of them friendly and helpful especially Mohammad with lovely smile and welcoming    I  have been staying at the Gate since April 2023 and Im here for 6 months I thought of taking some time to reflect on my experience during my last month here for the benefit of others considering this place for a medium to longterm stay  In summary I recommend The Gate for their rooms the amenities and the people  The people  Everyone from the front desk staff to the room service crew are friendly professional and always willing to help Special shoutout to Vicente and Mohammed Since my very first day here in April Vicente has always greeted me with a smile and stopped to ask how I was doing no matter if I was in a rush or if he was tied up with guests He has always been available to help with anything I needed and throughout my time here he kindly helped me Amazing experience great apartment Comfortable bed and absolutely gorgeous view Air conditioning helped a lot during heatwave in London Staff was really helpful and very friendly We booked again following our stay and will be back more  Friendly  welcoming staff Modern  well maintained hotel with lovely interior We stayed in a lovely studio apartment Comfy bed Room was very clean  well equipped with a city view Would recommend  Had to book a last minute room after missing our Eurostar now we know to be there at least an hour before departure Vicente and Mohammed at the front desk did an amazing job at accommodating us and had our room ready only an hour after we booked We had a great time at the Gate Hotel the facilities are great and the staff is amazing specially Stefania The area where the hotel is located is perfect and close to the universities  The lounge on the 5th floor is great to gran a cup of coffee or get work done Thanks for the great stay The Gate London Hotel provides a memorable and comfortable stay in the heart of London The impeccable service stylish accommodations and excellent dining options make it a top choice for travelers looking to experience the best of the city I would gladly return for another stay and highly recommend it to fellow travelers During my recent stay at The Gate London Hotel I had the privilege of interacting with Mohammad at the reception and I must say his exceptional service left a lasting impression  My wife and I and our son had a wonderful stay at The Gate We stayed in The Residence which had two bedrooms two bathrooms and a kitchenette There was also a combination washerdryer which was a great convenience The space was roomy and well appointed It was very clean The staff were wonderful and responsive to our every need There is a small grocery store right across the street so we were able to get food for breakfast and snacks One small drawback was given the fact that they dont service the room every day we had to find places to hang our towels to dry which was a bit of a challenge Also the combo washer dryer is a mystery to us Canadians but the maintenance staff kindly gave us a crash course in its use Because the hotel is a bit off the tourist track but there'}, vector=None, shard_key=None), ScoredPoint(id=60, version=0, score=0.20521171747738168,

a shoe cupboard with 1 tiny bedl so not a Twin ar all There are better options in this area give this place a miss Booked 3 rooms for 4 nights for a total of 3300 through Bookingcom A member of my party backed out the same day I tried to cancel through bookingcom and my request went unanswered by the website and hotel for a week even after multiple emails I made an international call and the help desk was VERY rude constantly cutting me off and borderline yelling and told me they could not waive the cancellation fee as it was a Bookingcom policy but Bookingcom says it is a hotel policy Neither one wants to help and are very happy to take the 1100 for the empty room I will NOT be using this locationchain again and would advise others to do the same Amazing property very attentive and supportive staffspecial shout out to Stella who was so kind and helpful Express check in and check outexcellent Location well connected for public transportGreat complimentary breakfast Quad room we stayed was hugeLift for all floors This hotel is only good and worth it because of the destination close to centrum The rooms are very small and old the atmosphere smells bad at the hotel except for the lobby DONT pay for the breakfast its so small and it doesnt look delicious compared to the price you pay for it  I cant recommend this Hotel highly enough truly great value for what you pay But the very best of this hotel stands in his own personal who are highly trained and very welcoming They are also fluent in many languages my business partner is italian and we found out there was another italian girl working there her name was Stella and she was very kind to engage in conversations with us and satisfy each of our requests ', 'review_title': 'Jay', 'review_text_x': 'The room is

this hotel overall  Mr Mubashir gave us a very warm welcoming and all the staff there were kind hearted he gave us a room straight away before the check in timing that help us a lot since we had a very long time he gave us a spacious room with a very beautiful view Great location for a family Less than a 5 minute walk from Paddington Station and short walk to Kensington GardensHyde Park The kids loved the split level room and there was plenty of space for the 4 of us The morning breakfast was a great way to start the day and the staff was very attentive Im not a huge fan of scrambled eggs but was able to get a couple of fried eggs and espresso to kickstart my day    After returning home I noticed an extra fee in the credit card statement It was handled quickly and refunded after a phone call to the hotel They were friendly and apologized for the mistake    Will definitely stay at the same location on our next trip to London Mr mubashir and Tamara is very helpful at the front desk and the hotel location is excellent and room are small but convenient i had breakfast it excellent i will be back soon easy to access the paddington station thanks for every thing  Got in to the room and it was like a freezer The air con was hanging off the wall and was broke radiator was broke temporary small heater barely heated the room The shower had Black hair on the floor it was a disgusting poorly kept tiny tiny room Paid 130 for a Deluxe twin got a shoe cupboard with 1 tiny bedl so not a Twin ar all There are better options in this area give this place a miss Booked 3 rooms for 4 nights for a total of 3300 through Bookingcom A member of my party backed out the same day I tried to cancel through bookingcom and my request went unanswered by the website and hotel for a week even after multiple emails I made an international call and the help desk was VERY rude constantly cutting me off and borderline yelling and told me they could not waive the cancellation fee as it was a Bookingcom policy but Bookingcom says it is a hotel policy Neither one wants to help and are very happy to take the 1100 for the empty room I will NOT be using this locationchain again and would advise others to do the same Amazing property very attentive and supportive staffspecial shout out to Stella who was so kind and helpful Express check in and check outexcellent Location well connected for public transportGreat complimentary breakfast Quad room we stayed was hugeLift for all floors This hotel is only good and worth it because of the destination close to centrum The rooms are very small and old the atmosphere smells bad at the hotel except for the lobby DONT pay for the breakfast its so small and it doesnt look delicious compared to the price you pay for it  I cant recommend this Hotel highly enough truly great value for what you pay But the very best of this hotel stands in his own personal who are highly trained and very welcoming They are also fluent in many languages my business partner is italian and we found out there was another italian girl working there her name was Stella and she was very kind to engage in conversations with us and satisfy each of our

Hotel overlooking Percy Circus 14 mile from Kings Cross StationVery well located  by walk 10 from St Pancras and 30 from main touristic locations  Good breakfast Large rooms Average cleanliness which can be improved but it is correct  Be aware that room cleaning is not provided during stay under 7 days  Overall this hotel is good value Think slightly less glamourous than a regular Travelodge But clean  in the bits that matter nice staff and great location If noise in the corridors or traffic noise bothers you then maybe give it a miss but if you dont mind a few inconveniences like that for a price thats remarkable for central London go for it Very noisy outside the hotel sirens galore so disturbed sleep even though Im a heavy sleeper Rooms were small and a little tired looking but clean Breakfast average but could be busy Staff all extremely helpful Meh theyre rubbish but if youre lucky its less than 150 a night and its somewhere near where you need to be in the morning It had a bath which is fairly unusual for travelodges The stay was just as average as to be expected  The room was filthy when we arrived The bath and basin hadnt been cleaned and there was half a roll of toilet paper   The WiFi never worked in a week   I had to have my room key reprogrammed every single day Having the staff laugh at my irritation made it only worse   I will not stay here again Sernila was an absolute gem very welcoming and a great introduction to staying at travelodge she is an asset to your business as I stop at many travelodge and its more like conveyer belt of robots well done her The hotel is in a great location only 10 minutes wall from Kings Cross and St Pancras Stations Upon arrival I noticed that the reception bar and restraunt areas had been refurbished and were looking good My check in went very smoothly and took a matter of minutes   My room was fairly clean however it was rather dated and certainly not refurbishedmodernised like the website suggests it had very dated fixtures and fittings which may have been left by a previous hotel chain The bed was nice and comfy however across 3 nights at this hotel I didnt have particularly good sleeps as you can hear everything going on in rooms around and above as well as the corridor there is no sound proofing whatsoever  I last stayed at this hotel 4 years ago and from what I can remember the Poor customer service Staff dont seem to want to help constantly requesting things to be replaced or provided in the first instance No WiFi available in room even though pay for it  staff dont seem to care From the warm welcome to the impeccably clean room and excellent service my stay at the hotel was outstanding Convenient location delicious dining and topnotch amenities A perfect weekend getaway Highly recommended We stayed for 2 nights in a twin roombeds were comfortable and clean alsothe room was clean and warm There was plenty of tea and coffee provided and you could pick up extra supplies from reception when neededIn the bathroom there was plenty of hot water and clean towels only issue we had was the bathroom door didnt shut properly We ate in the restaurant for breakfast and evening meal both were enjoyable The staff we met were lovely and friendly and very helpful check in and check out was very quick we asked for a hairdryer as there wasnt one in the room and was given one without any problem This was my 3rd visit to this  hotelno its not the ritzbut you get what you pay for Its cheap for london prices and its walking distance to kings cross and the underground Cleanliness is a problem health and safety is a problem and with cobwebs and holes in the ceiling smell in rooms and carpets not hoovered would suggest a thorough look before ready for next guest as things from previous guest left behind  If I could give this place less than 1 star then I would We had a long travel back from Paris and stayed in this travelodge We checked in late and was leaving early so really didnt expect much as only needed a bed for the night We checked in and the room was beyond disgusting Blood stained carpets the room smelt of awful mold couldnt open the windows as its too noises bathroom was full of dust even coming out the shower head Kettle was full of like scale and dirt made a cup of tea and it had bits floating in it beds are camp beds so small and uncomfortable breakfast was inedible had to wait for 10 minutes for a coffee in a que for the machine as they pack everyone in with 2 machines the whole place has a terrible smell too Please reconsider to somewhere else if Very noisy no hairdryer in the room and quite far from the train stations The noise was very early in morning and its was delivery trucks for Travelodge and it was happening in the Travelodge compound  site Staff were rude and unfriendly I came here with two friends  The three of us booked a family room However we had the good fortune to have an upgrade to two twin rooms without extra charge  I am not always a fan of budget hotels but I was pleasantly surprised  Our rooms were warm and comfortable I slept well What I really liked was that there was a bath  So often you just have to endure a shower Breakfast was basic but absolutely fine  I would stay here again  This experience has changed my mind about budget hotels  From what my friends said we all were happy with our visit  We all thought we had value for money Great location  comfy bedrooms need deep clean before next guest arrives Room had not been hovered from previous guest plug hole in bath had hair from previous guest No toilet brush provided  Breakfast good value for money  Clean and tidy  staff were lovely and bubbly Nothing was too much trouble Breakfast had a good selection and was hot  Some rooms could do with a bit of a tidy but cant complain for the price and location really Would use again and the sister hotel is 5 mins away from this one so I would even give that a go in future  Comfy rooms and staff that seem to be hand picked for thier bubbly personalities Had a problem heating the lobby so had temporary heaters But very busy and a good reasonably priced place to stay in central London  Located approximately 10 minutes from the train station the hotel boasts a convenient location The bathrooms are on the petite side and the absence of a fridge in the rooms is worth noting   On the positive side the breakfast options were fitting providing a satisfactory start to the day The affordability of the dinner meal deal is another notable aspect   Additionally the manager Momo adds a personal touch to the experience by being very friendly and actively seeking feedback The stench of mould and mould cleaner was over powering  The staff were as helpful as they could be I was told that all rooms were suffering smells after a flood They couldnt move me but brought air freshener The team member gagged as he came into the room which made me think it was particularly bad in this room The air freshener helped for about an hour Id argue that room 109 is uninhabitable  Yes it was a cheap price but if its cheap for a reason this should be disclosed OK first the good points  The hotel is in an good location close to public transport links and in a decent area with a few shops and restaurants very close by  The reception is clean and welcoming the staff in reception were friendly and helpful The bed was comfy and there were teabags in the room   The not so good points  The hotel is tired grubby and worn I was on the 5th floor and the room had been repainted but really really carelessly There was a thick layer of paint on the walls and woodwork which was flaking off but the window was painted shut and could not be opened  The furniture was old shabby wooden stuff with all sorts of stains and chips and for some reason there was a second bed made up in my room  why  The TV was filthy so dusty behind it that Apart from the fact that this hotel is very very tired  with stained and old carpets very poorly fitted bathroom and general wear and teardamage evident in the room itself you run the risk of having the issue I had which was near CONSTANT fire alarm activation that made my stay there an absolute nightmare   An adjoining room suffered a flood from a burst pipe apparently I only ever found out by talking to the people staying in that room as the staff point blank refused to tell us what was going on After paying for early check in I was almost immediately forced to evacuate and then after we were allowed back in much later the fire alarm went off intermittently for hours It was awful    We received a terrible service  We arrived after three hours of travelling for our birthday weekend away to stay in a double room for two nights which has cost us 142 As we arrive we have been told we will need to stay in a twin room due to a flood that occurred much earlier in the day and told that we can move rooms in the morning  This is our trip away and we are a couple so ideally we want to share a bed We were told we could move the next 6th January but this is an inconvenience to our trip  We tried to come to three resolutions to enjoy our trip still  A we asked for any kind of room upgrade B we asked for a partial refund as we are receiving a poorer service  C we asked to be moved to a different travelodge within the vicinity   Someone could have at least We book and pay for double beds we got 2 single beds The hotel promise we will changes rooms next day but next day the say no no service and no cleaning for the 4 nights we stay there Dont choose travelodget  Bathroom not cleaned properly  mold and rust around the bath fittings and a dirty water ring around the bath No handwash in the dispenser They didnt rectify it after saying they would I didnt expect luxury but I did expect cleanliness and comfort  Great breakfast  we spend a really good time with my family The ubicacin  was great  because is close to the center of London All hostel staff  really kind  The only thing thats wasnt good its they dont have free WiFi  If you do not have many expectations this is the hotel  for you The best room for a businessman probably not for a family Clean room but not well equipped Not too far from the tube station and not very cheap A nice budget one where you pay only for the services you use rooms are not very big but they are clean and the beds are super cozy Flat screen was small but Im not a TV person myself so I didnt mind The bar is serving breakfast and dinner as well as multiple drinks and snacks Safe for solo travellers  and families with kidsA good value for money Everything was great lovely team Special thanks to Jackie  Really nice place with restaurant and bar Great location not far away from Kings cross st pancras by foot I recommand this place for family Friends couples  Your main manager was the rudest and meanest man I have ever met  I was traveling to Ukraine to see my family whom I have not seen for a while All my mother asked is just to bring some British cheese In the room it was boiling hot and there where no fridge I asked to put my bag in the fridge and they declined And then I just really politely asked for some ice at least Your main manager was so rude  he said It is your fault that you assumed that we have fridge Its not my problem I will only give you one small paper glass of ice  He even called a security on me  small girl who was asking an ice I really politely was asking and saying that I can pay for ice please just give me another glass and he was sooo rude and mean That was 11 pm so all the shops were The bathroom was dirty the bathtub had black stains The doors have to be slammed to be shut so everyone does it You will ehar it through your whole night There were not enough hairdryers and when we asked why none were available as the website specified we were told that hairdryers being available doenst mean you will get one We would have brought one if we knew ahead of time We got clean towels once during our stay the bin wasnt emptied once In conclusion dont come here or at least go to a different Travelodge Oh and the pictures are completely misleading None of our rooms looked remotely like the pictures shown here only ones like some users here have shown the old wooden ones The rooms need refurbishments asap There was also a bad odor in our room The Not worthy what you pay  and the service you get you will end up on changing your room and getting something you didnt pay for hotel service is 0 no detergent for wash and shower  really frustrating  I would mention that the staff on arrival and check in were very welcoming and efficient  The room basic but clean enough and cosy warm so first impressions were good  However the shower was a lukewarm trickle the flat pillows insufficient for a good night sleep  We used the car park at 20 for 24hrs it has limited space we were lucky and is very dirty with rubbish We picked up a puncture which delayed our departure although obviously cannot be sure we got it here We didnt have the breakfast at the hotel but if you just want a decent coffee theres a good coffee shop directly opposite the hotel entrance Good locazione very close to Underground and railway station Easy access The room are very clean and modern confortable  The breakfast is very rich Freindly  staff and very easy check inout Highly recommended    Shout out to Joyce and Kamilla Amy  two of the most lovely and thoughtful staff members weve ever met They were a constant source of joy and energy all the way through our stay and couldnt do enough for us  or anyone else staying The staff was very welcoming and friendly We got a great deal especially considering the fact we were traveling around the holidays The bed was very comfortable  Our room wasnt very clean with the main issue being dust and hair on the floor The sheets and towels were clean The bathroom wasnt very fresh either Staff did help us out with this and offered complementary breakfast  All I can say is AVOID  First impressions of the hotel are wasnt great The receptionists seemed more interested in hugging and chatting to each other than dealing with customers The reception itself was ok but all goes down hill once you get out of the lift  Wow the corridors are disgusting TLC needed here  Bedroom was vile the carpets made me feel sick dread to think what was living in the carpets Wardrobe broken it all needs ripping out  Only positive is the bed linen was clean and fresh The bathroom was clean  I wouldnt stay here again and I certainly wouldnt recommend  Front desk allowed linecut and being rude We had to collect clean towel at front desk on the third day No room cleaning service during the stay at all No toilet paper or bin bag replaced Prepare all supplies by yourself and most importantly prepare a very broad mind to accept the fact of being ignored at front desk  I was under the impression the hotel was the new design according to Travelodge website It did not appear to be and was dated looking The outside of the hotel was scruffy with graffiti on walls and windows and the area was rundown  The rooms are not sound deadened or sound proof as the neighbouring residents were drunk and noisy waking us up a number of times during our stay The plus points were the room was very clean and tidy as was the bathroom We needed more towels 3 persons which were placed in room however despite us leaving used towels in bath for collection by housekeeping they were left Restricting movement even more as the small family room was very small   Be warned if you use Apple double charging plugs they do not fit room electric sockets due to This is not a hotel Why Because it s TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT YOU CLEAN THE ROOM AND BATHROOM EVERY SIX DAYS ONLY NOT DAILY OR EVERY TWO DAYS SIX DAYS And the reason given by the manager this morning is that in most of big travelodges there are so many rooms they cant CLEAN them WHY DONT YOU TELL RIGHT AWAY you have to ask for New towels New sheets etc etc Funny thing  in small Travelodges like the one in the same King Cross rea they clean rooms and bathroom And all this is a Post Covid reason I am surprised this place is not another great INFECTION point Loved our stay at Kings Cross Royal Scott The rooms are very basic but the staff are so friendly especially Jackie on reception We love her The hotel is about 10 minutes walk from Kings Cross Station We checked in early and checked out late for only an extra 20

supplies by yourself and most importantly prepare a very broad mind to accept the fact of being ignored at front desk  I was under the impression the hotel was the new design according to Travelodge website It did not appear to be and was dated looking The outside of the hotel was scruffy with graffiti on walls and windows and the area was rundown  The rooms are not sound deadened or sound proof as the neighbouring residents were drunk and noisy waking us up a number of times during our stay The plus points were the room was very clean and tidy as was the bathroom We needed more towels 3 persons which were placed in room however despite us leaving used towels in bath for collection by housekeeping they were left Restricting movement even more as the small family room was very small   Be warned if you use Apple double charging plugs they do not fit room electric sockets due to This is not a hotel Why Because it s TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT YOU CLEAN THE ROOM AND BATHROOM EVERY SIX DAYS ONLY NOT DAILY OR EVERY TWO DAYS SIX DAYS And the reason given by the manager this morning is that in most of big travelodges there are so many rooms they cant CLEAN them WHY DONT YOU TELL RIGHT AWAY you have to ask for New towels New sheets etc etc Funny thing  in small Travelodges like the one in the same King Cross rea they clean rooms and bathroom And all this is a Post Covid reason I am surprised this place is not another great INFECTION point Loved our stay at Kings Cross Royal Scott The rooms are very basic but the staff are so friendly especially Jackie on reception We love her The hotel is about 10 minutes walk from Kings Cross Station We checked in early and checked out late for only an extra 20 We will be back '}, vector=None, shard_key=None)]\n",

modern and clean Friendly staff that will help with any questions or concerns So far a wonderful experience at The Gate and would not hesitate to recommend it 5 stars for sure   This was our last stop before heading home to Australia for three nights We stayed at the Wilde Apartments just down the street at the beginning of the trip but in the interests of market research booked this on the way out  This place is modern just like the Wilde but our experience was different  The address may be White Chapel Lane but its on the corner of a busy road just like the Wilde We love the East end of London with its vibe and energy but we like a good nights sleep  We had booked several months out and requested a quiet room but got allocated one on a lower floor facing the A13 Despite being touted for long stays this was just a hotel room with a small kitchenette no table and chairs for dining  We asked for another room and got a nice corner accessible one it claims to be 5  for this it would be cheap and the location is super its a 3 star superior or 4 star nice rooms but small with kitchenette no service for towels etc  this would be good  if you knew otherwise your pull your wet towels out of the shower tray and use again lounge in 5 th floor is good but you dont know where to find stuff etc cleanliness is good  personell friendly so not advertised fully correctly price for 3 star plus at location on higher side  location top Group of 10 ladies had an overnight here for a friends birthday The service was excellent rooms a decent size quality bedding although double beds are slightly on the small size Clean and very good customer service with complementary tea coffee and a small mini bar also complimentary I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend  I recently stayed at The Gate for my partners birthday and it did not disappoint After booking I reached out to the hotel to see if they were able to offer any complimentary upgrades to make our stay extra special Jamal who took care of my request via email was incredibly kind and helpful and ensured that a note was made on our reservation to fulfil our requirements subject to availability   We arrived at the hotel earlier than our check in time and were greeted with the lovely Gabriela who was so friendly and bubbly She allowed us to check in earlier than usual and upgraded us to a high level room which had a beautiful view of the city and even a pint on the house for the birthday boy   The rooms were beautifully decorated quite unique bathrooms and had a very Nice room comfortable and quiet and well appointed with modern facilities and bathroom Well located and I would recommend staying here The front of house staff were very helpful Thanks a lot for helping us with our stay Friendly staff

breakfast that was also great value for money Great location  Highly recommend would definitely stay here again Highly recommend Nice room with nice shampoo and body wash Nice view too if stay at higher floors The nearby streets do not feel that safe at night and nearest train station only have stairs Walkable distance to fast food and supermarkets  Minor inconvenience Doesnt have daily housekeeping and only throw rubbish and refresh towels every 4th day We stayed at The Gate due to its fantastic location and when we got there it was absolutely the case We performed the early checkin prior to arrival but when we arrived it wasnt clear how to then scan the QR code provided in the email so we ended up manually checkingin which made the online checkin somewhat pointless   We paid 451 for two nights including breakfast in one of the studio apartments compared to other hotels Ive stayed in for similar prices in London I felt the room left a lot to be desired It was clean and tidy but the room itself was showing signs of age with chips and chunks taken from the wall the carpet looking well trodden I just expected more for the price   The kitchen was well equipped with what you would need to keep yourself going and Excellent hotelElegant and modern apartamentsWell Located closed to the underground station I would like to say thank you to VicenteMohammadStefania and Gosia They were really polite and friendly  Beautiful decorationLovely smell Vicente and Stefania are reslly great host I loved Le Labo toiletries The hotel is good located and a walking distsnce to Brick Lane and Liverpool street station I would recommend tobook a Skyline apartment and have amazing views Such a reasonably priced hotel Absolutely lovely lobby with a quick check in A room on the 18th floor so pretty cool view tv with sound bar Stocked kitchenette and a greatsized shower  The only downside was we had a connecting room with someone else and we could hear their tv through it as well as the odd cough Made me a little uncomfortable with it being so close but honestly for such a reasonable price this hotel is well worth it Good facilities comfortable and cozy with excelent views and well connected with public transport Very good customer service especially from Vicente who answered all our questions and provided excelent service So close to so much Out the door to the left Efes for amazing Turkish food Grounded for breakfast Great curry down bricklane  To the right pizza or pasta at Amelias  So close to the underground to get anywhere  Short walk to the Tower of London and

Vincent   The hotel is very clean and well maintained The best location and hundreds of restaurants around  Love to come back and stay here Very good for long term stays and very accommodative for long term rates The team at Flavour Venues  Events recently had the pleasure of staying at The Gate Hotel This luxury aparthotel exceeded our expectations and provided us with a quiet and very comfortable stay in a bustling part of the City This Aldgate based hotel has excellent transport links and is walking distance from City business hubs plus popular locations such as Tower Bridge Brick Lane and Shoreditch Despite its busy location The Gate provides an atmosphere of serenity plus a very warm welcome The Gate Hotel London boasts a strong collection of 189 apartment bedrooms Our

5 nights at the end of September 2023 We had a terrific time because Rooms were very comfortable  good sleeping every night we appreciated the kitchenette facilities  dishwasher basic dishes glasses and table service clothes washerdryer unit and fridge  The 5th floor lounge was a big plus   complimentary coffee and flavored water available all day and evening very reasonably priced and good quality Continental breakfasts every morning  hot breakfasts also available but we were fine without comfy furniture and lots of windows for the times we just wanted to sit all I love staying at the gate The staff are always so nice Gabriele and her team always welcome me back with a smile and warm welcome The rooms are so much better than a hotel And the 5th floor lounge is so convenient especially staying with colleagues as a place to hang out and not be in the lobby or each others rooms  I like the gym  had all the basics  perhaps a bit small Over 6 people is tight but usually a mix of people doing cardio vs resistance training Convenient to liverpool street station and walks across tower bridge and the south bank The room had excellent amenities and a fabulous view The staff Mohammad Stefanie and Renata were very helpful and took care of everything The space is very modern and the bed was comfortable although would be great to have option of non feather pillows and covers for those with allergies Location is close to station and also supermarket and several restaurants Would stay here again  What a treat to stay at The Gate for a business trip The room is spacious and comfortable I especially like that there is a lot of storage in the shower room The lounge in the fifth floor is a modern and relaxing place to gather before or after dinner We stayed at The Gate for 2 nights earlier this week and thoroughly enjoyed our time there  Our room was very well equipped and the bed very comfy  We also thought the 5th floor lounge was a nice touch and as well as having breakfast there we used it to get a cup of coffee when we returned to the hotel in the evening  Special mention must also go to Gabriella and Mohamad who were so helpful in giving us directions to the various places we were visiting Stayed here for a couple for weeks The location is great for getting around London The studio Ive stayed in had everything I needed and was kept very clean The staff was nice and helpful most notably Stefanie Vicente and Yozlem I would like to thank all of the Gates staff for truly making my stay truly unforgettable especially Stefania and Vicente that welcome me

for dinner Ill be back I was very happy in my stay everything was clean very quiet place I slept very good also high speed WiFi  Nice view in my room everything around you restaurants and supper market And the important thing the staff all of them friendly and helpful especially Mohammad with lovely smile and welcoming    I  have been staying at the Gate since April 2023 and Im here for 6 months I thought of taking some time to reflect on my experience during my last month here for the benefit of others considering this place for a medium to longterm stay  In summary I recommend The Gate for their rooms the amenities and the people  The people  Everyone from the front desk staff to the room service crew are friendly professional and always willing to help Special shoutout to Vicente and Mohammed Since my very first day here in April Vicente has always greeted me with a smile and stopped to ask how I was doing no matter if I was in a rush or if he was tied up with guests He has always been available to help with anything I needed and throughout my time here he kindly helped me Amazing experience great apartment Comfortable bed and absolutely gorgeous view Air conditioning helped a lot during heatwave in London Staff was really helpful and very friendly We booked again following our stay and will be back more  Friendly  welcoming staff Modern  well maintained hotel with lovely interior We stayed in a lovely studio apartment Comfy bed Room was very clean  well equipped with a city view Would recommend  Had to book a last minute room after missing

We had a great time at the Gate Hotel the facilities are great and the staff is amazing specially Stefania The area where the hotel is located is perfect and close to the universities  The lounge on the 5th floor is great to gran a cup of coffee or get work done Thanks for the great stay The Gate London Hotel provides a memorable and comfortable stay in the heart of London The impeccable service stylish accommodations and excellent dining options make it a top choice for travelers looking to experience the best of the city I would gladly return for another stay and highly recommend it to fellow travelers During my recent stay at The Gate London Hotel I had the privilege of interacting with Mohammad at the reception and I must say his exceptional service left a lasting impression  My wife and I and our son had a wonderful stay at The Gate We stayed in The Residence which had two bedrooms two bathrooms and a kitchenette There was also a combination washerdryer which was a great convenience The space was roomy and well appointed It was very clean The staff were wonderful and responsive to our every need There is a small grocery store right across the street so we were able to get food for breakfast and snacks One small drawback was given the fact that they dont service the room every day we had to find places to hang our towels to dry which was a bit of a challenge Also the combo washer dryer is a mystery to us Canadians but the maintenance staff kindly gave us a crash course in its use Because the hotel is a bit off the tourist track but there', 'review_title':

      "{'hotel_name': 'Travelodge London Kings Cross Royal Scot', 'hotel_description': 'Sixstory Hotel overlooking Percy Circus 14 mile from Kings Cross StationVery well located  by walk 10 from St Pancras and 30 from main touristic locations  Good breakfast Large rooms Average cleanliness which can be improved but it is correct  Be aware that room cleaning is not provided during stay under 7 days  Overall this hotel is good value Think slightly less glamourous than a regular Travelodge But clean  in the bits that matter nice staff and great location If noise in the corridors or traffic noise bothers you then maybe give it a miss but if you dont mind a few inconveniences like that for a price thats remarkable for central London go for it Very noisy outside the hotel sirens galore so disturbed sleep even though Im a heavy sleeper Rooms were small and a little tired looking but clean Breakfast average but could be busy Staff all extremely helpful Meh theyre rubbish but if youre lucky its less than 150 a night and its somewhere near where you need to be in the morning It had a bath which is fairly unusual for travelodges The stay was just as average as to be expected  The room was filthy when we arrived The bath and basin hadnt been cleaned and there was half a roll of toilet paper   The WiFi never worked in a week   I had to have my room key reprogrammed every single day Having the staff laugh at my irritation made it only worse   I will not stay here again Sernila was an absolute gem very welcoming and a great introduction to staying at travelodge she is an asset to your business as I stop at many travelodge and its more like conveyer belt of robots well done her The hotel is in a great location only 10 minutes wall from Kings Cross and St Pancras Stations Upon arrival I noticed that the reception bar and restraunt areas had been refurbished and were looking good My check in went very smoothly and took a matter of minutes   My room was fairly clean however it was rather dated and certainly not refurbishedmodernised like the website suggests it had very dated fixtures and fittings which may have been left by a previous hotel chain The bed was nice and comfy however across 3 nights at this hotel I didnt have particularly good sleeps as you can hear everything going on in rooms around and above as well as the corridor there is no sound proofing whatsoever  I last stayed at this hotel 4 years ago and from what I can remember the Poor customer service Staff dont seem to want to help constantly requesting things to be replaced or provided in the first instance No WiFi available in room even though pay for it  staff dont seem to care From the warm welcome to the impeccably clean room and excellent service my stay at the hotel was outstanding Convenient location delicious dining and topnotch amenities A perfect weekend getaway Highly recommended We stayed for 2 nights in a twin roombeds were comfortable and clean alsothe room was clean and warm There was plenty of tea and coffee provided and you could pick up extra supplies from reception when neededIn the bathroom there was plenty of hot water and clean towels only issue we had was the bathroom door didnt shut properly We ate in the restaurant for breakfast and evening meal both were enjoyable The staff we met were lovely and friendly and very helpful check in and check out was very quick we asked for a hairdryer as there wasnt one in the room and was given one without any problem This was my 3rd visit to this  hotelno its not the ritzbut you get what you pay for Its cheap for london prices and its walking distance to kings cross and the underground Cleanliness is a problem health and safety is a problem and with cobwebs and holes in the ceiling smell in rooms and carpets not hoovered would suggest a thorough look before ready for next guest as things from previous guest left behind  If I could give this place less than 1 star then I would We had a long travel back from Paris and stayed in this travelodge We checked in late and was leaving early so really didnt expect much as only needed a bed for the night We checked in and the room was beyond disgusting Blood stained carpets the room smelt of awful mold couldnt open the windows as its too noises bathroom was full of dust even coming out the shower head Kettle was full of like scale and dirt made a cup of tea and it had bits floating in it beds are camp beds so small and uncomfortable breakfast was inedible had to wait for 10 minutes for a coffee in a que for the machine as they pack everyone in with 2 machines the whole place has a terrible smell too Please reconsider to somewhere else if Very noisy no hairdryer in the room and quite far from the train stations The noise was very early in morning and its was delivery trucks for Travelodge and it was happening in the Travelodge compound  site Staff were rude and unfriendly I came here with two friends  The three of us booked a family room However we had the good fortune to have an upgrade to two twin rooms without extra charge  I am not always a fan of budget hotels but I was pleasantly surprised  Our rooms were warm and comfortable I slept well What I really liked was that there was a bath  So often you just have to endure a shower Breakfast was basic but absolutely fine  I would stay here again  This experience has changed my mind about budget hotels  From what my friends said we all were happy with our visit  We all thought we had value for money Great location  comfy bedrooms need deep clean before next guest arrives Room had not been hovered from previous guest plug hole in bath had hair from previous guest No toilet brush provided  Breakfast good value for money  Clean and tidy  staff were lovely and bubbly Nothing was too much trouble Breakfast had a good selection and was hot  Some rooms could do with a bit of a tidy but cant complain for the price and location really Would use again and the sister hotel is 5 mins away from this one so I would even give that a go in future  Comfy rooms and staff that seem to be hand picked for thier bubbly personalities Had a problem heating the lobby so had temporary heaters But very busy and a good reasonably priced place to stay in central London  Located approximately 10 minutes from the train station the hotel boasts a convenient location The bathrooms are on the petite side and the absence of a fridge in the rooms is worth noting   On the positive side the breakfast options were fitting providing a satisfactory start to the day The affordability of the dinner meal deal is another notable aspect   Additionally the manager Momo adds a personal touch to the experience by being very friendly and actively seeking feedback The stench of mould and mould cleaner was over powering  The staff were as helpful as they could be I was told that all rooms were suffering smells after a flood They couldnt move me but brought air freshener The team member gagged as he came into the room which made me think it was particularly bad in this room The air freshener helped for about an hour Id argue that room 109 is uninhabitable  Yes it was a cheap price but if its cheap for a reason this should be disclosed OK first the good points  The hotel is in an good location close to public transport links and in a decent area with a few shops and restaurants very close by  The reception is clean and welcoming the staff in reception were friendly and helpful The bed was comfy and there were teabags in the room   The not so good points  The hotel is tired grubby and worn I was on the 5th floor and the room had been repainted but really really carelessly There was a thick layer of paint on the walls and woodwork which was flaking off but the window was painted shut and could not be opened  The furniture was old shabby wooden stuff with all sorts of stains and chips and for some reason there was a second bed made up in my room  why  The TV was filthy so dusty behind it that Apart from the fact that this hotel is very very tired  with stained and old carpets very poorly fitted bathroom and general wear and teardamage evident in the room itself you run the risk of having the issue I had which was near CONSTANT fire alarm activation that made my stay there an absolute nightmare   An adjoining room suffered a flood from a burst pipe apparently I only ever found out by talking to the people staying in that room as the staff point blank refused to tell us what was going on After paying for early check in I was almost immediately forced to evacuate and then after we were allowed back in much later the fire alarm went off intermittently for hours It was awful    We received a terrible service  We arrived after three hours of travelling for our birthday weekend away to stay in a double room for two nights which has cost us 142 As we arrive we have been told we will need to stay in a twin room due to a flood that occurred much earlier in the day and told that we can move rooms in the morning  This is our trip away and we are a couple so ideally we want to share a bed We were told we could move the next 6th January but this is an inconvenience to our trip  We tried to come to three resolutions to enjoy our trip still  A we asked for any kind of room upgrade B we asked for a partial refund as we are receiving a poorer service  C we asked to be moved to a different travelodge within the vicinity   Someone could have at least We book and pay for double beds we got 2 single beds The hotel promise we will changes rooms next day but next day the say no no service and no cleaning for the 4 nights we stay there Dont choose travelodget  Bathroom not cleaned properly  mold and rust around the bath fittings and a dirty water ring around the bath No handwash in the dispenser They didnt rectify it after saying they would I didnt expect luxury but I did expect cleanliness and comfort  Great breakfast  we spend a really good time with my family The ubicacin  was great  because is close to the center of London All hostel staff  really kind  The only thing thats wasnt good its they dont have free WiFi  If you do not have many expectations this is the hotel  for you The best room for a businessman probably not for a family Clean room but not well equipped Not too far from the tube station and not very cheap A nice budget one where you pay only for the services you use rooms are not very big but they are clean and the beds are super cozy Flat screen was small but Im not a TV person myself so I didnt mind The bar is serving breakfast and dinner as well as multiple drinks and snacks Safe for solo travellers  and families with kidsA good value for money Everything was great lovely team Special thanks to Jackie  Really nice place with restaurant and bar Great location not far away from Kings cross st pancras by foot I recommand this place for family Friends couples  Your main manager was the rudest and meanest man I have ever met  I was traveling to Ukraine to see my family whom I have not seen for a while All my mother asked is just to bring some British cheese In the room it was boiling hot and there where no fridge I asked to put my bag in the fridge and they declined And then I just really politely asked for some ice at least Your main manager was so rude  he said It is your fault that you assumed that we have fridge Its not my problem I will only give you one small paper glass of ice  He even called a security on me  small girl who was asking an ice I really politely was asking and saying that I can pay for ice please just give me another glass and he was sooo rude and mean That was 11 pm so all the shops were The bathroom was dirty the bathtub had black stains The doors have to be slammed to be shut so everyone does it You will ehar it through your whole night There were not enough hairdryers and when we asked why none were available as the website specified we were told that hairdryers being available doenst mean you will get one We would have brought one if we knew ahead of time We got clean towels once during our stay the bin wasnt emptied once In conclusion dont come here or at least go to a different Travelodge Oh and the pictures are completely misleading None of our rooms looked remotely like the pictures shown here only ones like some users here have shown the old wooden ones The rooms need refurbishments asap There was also a bad odor in our room The Not worthy what you pay  and the service you get you will end up

sheets etc etc Funny thing  in small Travelodges like the one in the same King Cross rea they clean rooms and bathroom And all this is a Post Covid reason I am surprised this place is not another great INFECTION point Loved our stay at Kings Cross Royal Scott The rooms are very basic but the staff are so friendly especially Jackie on reception We love her The hotel is about 10 minutes walk

main touristic locations  Good breakfast Large rooms Average cleanliness which can be improved but it is correct  Be aware that room cleaning is not provided during stay under 7 days  Overall this hotel is good value Think slightly less glamourous than a regular Travelodge But clean  in the bits that matter nice staff and great location If noise in the corridors or traffic noise bothers you then maybe give it a miss but if you dont mind a few inconveniences like that for a price thats remarkable for central London go for it Very noisy outside the hotel sirens galore so disturbed sleep even though Im a heavy sleeper Rooms were small and a little tired looking but clean Breakfast average but could be busy Staff all extremely helpful Meh theyre rubbish but if youre lucky its less than 150 a night and its somewhere near where you need to be in the morning It had a bath which is fairly unusual for travelodges The stay was just as average as to be expected  The room was filthy when we arrived The bath and basin hadnt been cleaned and there was half a roll of toilet paper   The WiFi never worked in a week   I had to have my room key reprogrammed every single day Having the staff laugh at my irritation made it only worse   I will not stay here again Sernila was an absolute gem very welcoming and a great introduction to staying at travelodge she is an asset to your business as I stop at many travelodge and its more like conveyer belt of robots well done her The hotel is in a great location only 10 minutes wall from Kings Cross and St Pancras Stations Upon arrival I noticed that the reception bar and restraunt areas had been refurbished and were looking good My check in went very smoothly and took a matter of minutes   My room was fairly clean however it was rather dated and certainly not refurbishedmodernised like the website suggests it had very dated fixtures and fittings which may have been left by a previous hotel chain The bed was nice and comfy however across 3 nights at this hotel I didnt have particularly good sleeps as you can hear everything going on in rooms around and above as well as the corridor there is no sound proofing whatsoever  I last stayed at this hotel 4 years ago and from what I can remember the Poor customer service Staff dont seem to want to help constantly requesting things to be replaced or provided in the first instance No WiFi available in room even though pay for it  staff dont seem to care From the warm welcome to the impeccably clean room and excellent service my stay at the hotel was outstanding Convenient location delicious dining and topnotch amenities A perfect weekend getaway Highly recommended We stayed for 2 nights in a twin roombeds were comfortable and clean alsothe room was clean and warm There was plenty of tea and coffee provided and you could pick up extra supplies from reception when neededIn the bathroom there was plenty of hot water and clean towels only issue we had was the bathroom door didnt shut properly We ate in the restaurant for breakfast and evening meal both were enjoyable The staff we met were lovely and friendly and very helpful check in and check out was very quick we asked for a hairdryer as there wasnt one in the room and was given one without any problem This was my 3rd visit to this  hotelno its not the ritzbut you get what you pay for Its cheap for london prices and its walking distance to kings cross and the underground Cleanliness is a problem health and safety is a problem and with cobwebs and holes in the ceiling smell in rooms and carpets not hoovered would suggest a thorough look before ready for next guest as things from previous guest left behind  If I could give this place less than 1 star then I would We had a long travel back from Paris and stayed in this travelodge We checked in late and was leaving early so really didnt expect much as only needed a bed for the night We checked in and the room was beyond disgusting Blood stained carpets the room smelt of awful mold couldnt open the windows as its too noises bathroom was full of dust even coming out the shower head Kettle was full of like scale and dirt made a cup of tea and it had bits floating in it beds are camp beds so small and uncomfortable breakfast was inedible had to wait for 10 minutes for a coffee in a que for the machine as they pack everyone in with 2 machines the whole place has a terrible smell too Please reconsider to somewhere else if Very noisy no hairdryer in the room and quite far from the train stations The noise was very early in morning and its was delivery trucks for Travelodge and it was happening in the Travelodge compound  site Staff were rude and unfriendly I came here with two friends  The three of us booked a family room However we had the good fortune to have an upgrade to two twin rooms without extra charge  I am not always a fan of budget hotels but I was pleasantly surprised  Our rooms were warm and comfortable I slept well What I really liked was that there was a bath  So often you just have to endure a shower Breakfast was basic but absolutely fine  I would stay here again  This experience has changed my mind about budget hotels  From what my friends said we all were happy with our visit  We all thought we had value for money Great location  comfy bedrooms need deep clean before next guest arrives Room had not been hovered from previous guest plug hole in bath had hair from previous guest No toilet brush provided  Breakfast good value for money  Clean and tidy  staff were lovely and bubbly Nothing was too much trouble Breakfast had a good selection and was hot  Some rooms could do with a bit of a tidy but cant complain for the price and location really Would use again and the sister hotel is 5 mins away from this one so I would even give that a go in future  Comfy rooms and staff that seem to be hand picked for thier bubbly personalities Had a problem heating the lobby so had temporary heaters But very busy and a good reasonably priced place to stay in central London  Located approximately 10 minutes from the train station the hotel boasts a convenient location The bathrooms are on the petite side and the absence of a fridge in the rooms is worth noting   On the positive side the breakfast options were fitting providing a satisfactory start to the day The affordability of the dinner meal deal is another notable aspect   Additionally the manager Momo adds a personal touch to the experience by being very friendly and actively seeking feedback The stench of mould and mould cleaner was over powering  The staff were as helpful as they could be I was told that all rooms were suffering smells after a flood They couldnt move me but brought air freshener The team member gagged as he came into the room which made me think it was particularly bad in this room The air freshener helped for about an hour Id argue that room 109 is uninhabitable  Yes it was a cheap price but if its cheap for a reason this should be disclosed OK first the good points  The hotel is in an good location close to public transport links and in a decent area with a few shops and restaurants very close by  The reception is clean and welcoming the staff in reception were friendly and helpful The bed was comfy and there were teabags in the room   The not so good points  The hotel is tired grubby and worn I was on the 5th floor and the room had been repainted but really really carelessly There was a thick layer of paint on the walls and woodwork which was flaking off but the window was painted shut and could not be opened  The furniture was old shabby wooden stuff with all sorts of stains and chips and for some reason there was a second bed made up in my room  why  The TV was filthy so dusty behind it that Apart from the fact that this hotel is very very tired  with stained and old carpets very poorly fitted bathroom and general wear and teardamage evident in the room itself you run the risk of having the issue I had which was near CONSTANT fire alarm activation that made my stay there an absolute nightmare   An adjoining room suffered a flood from a burst pipe apparently I only ever found out by talking to the people staying in that room as the staff point blank refused to tell us what was going on After paying for early check in I was almost immediately forced to evacuate and then after we were allowed back in much later the fire alarm went off intermittently for hours It was awful    We received a terrible service  We arrived after three hours of travelling for our birthday weekend away to stay in a double room for two nights which has cost us 142 As we arrive we have been told we will need to stay in a twin room due to a flood that occurred much earlier in the day and told that we can move rooms in the morning  This is our trip away and we are a couple so ideally we want to share a bed We were told we could move the next 6th January but this is an inconvenience to our trip  We tried to come to three resolutions to enjoy our trip still  A we asked for any kind of room upgrade B we asked for a partial refund as we are receiving a poorer service  C we asked to be moved to a different travelodge within the vicinity   Someone could have at least We book and pay for double beds we got 2 single beds The hotel promise we will changes rooms next day but next day the say no no service and no cleaning for the 4 nights we stay there Dont choose travelodget  Bathroom not cleaned properly  mold and rust around the bath fittings and a dirty water ring around the bath No handwash in the dispenser They didnt rectify it after saying they would I didnt expect luxury but I did expect cleanliness and comfort  Great breakfast  we spend a really good time with my family The ubicacin  was great  because is close to the center of London All hostel staff  really kind  The only thing thats wasnt good its they dont have free WiFi  If you do not have many expectations this is the hotel  for you The best room for a businessman probably not for a family Clean room but not well equipped Not too far from the tube station and not very cheap A nice budget one where you pay only for the services you use rooms are not very big but they are clean and the beds are super cozy Flat screen was small but Im not a TV person myself so I didnt mind The bar is serving breakfast and dinner as well as multiple drinks and snacks Safe for solo travellers  and families with kidsA good value for money Everything was great lovely team Special thanks to Jackie  Really nice place with restaurant and bar Great location not far away from Kings cross st pancras by foot I recommand this place for family Friends couples  Your main manager was the rudest and meanest man I have ever met  I was traveling to Ukraine to see my family whom I have not seen for a while All my mother asked is just to bring some British cheese In the room it was boiling hot and there where no fridge I asked to put my bag in the fridge and they declined And then I just really politely asked for some ice at least Your main manager was so rude  he said It is your fault that you assumed that we have fridge Its not my problem I will only give you one small paper glass of ice  He even called a security on me  small girl who was asking an ice I really politely was asking and saying that I can pay for ice please just give me another glass and he was sooo rude and mean That was 11 pm so all the shops were The bathroom was dirty the bathtub had black stains The doors have to be slammed to be shut so everyone does it You will ehar it through your whole night There were not enough hairdryers and when we asked why none were available as the website specified we were told that hairdryers being available doenst mean you will get one We would have brought one if we knew ahead of time We got clean towels once during our stay the bin wasnt emptied once In conclusion dont come here or at least go to a different Travelodge Oh and the pictures are completely misleading None of our rooms looked remotely like the pictures shown here only ones like some users here have shown the old wooden ones The rooms need refurbishments asap There was also a bad odor in our room The Not worthy what you pay  and the service you get you will end up on changing your room and getting something you didnt pay for hotel service is 0 no detergent for wash and shower  really frustrating  I would mention that the staff on arrival and check in were very
