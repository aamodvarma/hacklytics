      "The Romance Istanbul Hotel would be a good fit for the user because it offers free wifi and has a gym for guests to use. The hotel description mentions that every room is equipped with a satellite TV and free wifi connection, ensuring the user will have access to the internet.

Furthermore, the description emphasizes the hotel's cleanliness, stating that the rooms are clean and the staff provides regular cleaning service. Overall, this hotel would be a good fit for the user as it provides the desired amenities of wifi and potentially a gym, while also prioritizing cleanliness."
